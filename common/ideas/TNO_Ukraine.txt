A lush land where one would not need lift a finger to reap the wealth, and where the future of Germany could be built in the sun by her sons. Of course, this was before a not insignificant percentage of the population were starved to death under German rule, the corporations took over most of the industrial sector, and the Reichskommissariat began to wither on the vine a lot more literally than anybody would be comfortable with. Ukraine is a hollow and bleeding shell, just waiting to be put out of its misery.
