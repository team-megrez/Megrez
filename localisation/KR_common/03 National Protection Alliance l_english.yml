 CHS_legitimacy: "부족한 정통성"
 CHS_legitimacy_desc: "Now that the North and South have been reunified, we must now begin the gargantuan task of creating a new Central Government for China. Many throughout China, especially in the recently-conquered North, do not recognise us as legitimate in the first place. It will take time and effort to prove ourselves to those who doubt us, and only then can we truly claim to have reunified China."
 CHS_bureaucracy: "감당불능한 관료"
 CHS_bureaucracy_desc: "Overnight, our bureaucracy went from governing a number of provinces in the south to governing the majority of China. To say that our bureaucracy is overstretched is an understatement. Our civil service will need to be expanded manifold in order to serve the newly-annexed provinces. Until then, our economy and ability to reach the people will suffer."
 CHS_military: "신중국군"
 CHS_military_desc: "중화 대륙이 재통일되면서 우리의 영광스러운 군대는 이제 새로운 중앙정부 소속이 되었습니다. 그렇기에 수십 년간 독자적으로 발전해왔던 수많은 군수공장들과 군관학교들은 통합되어야 합니다."

 CHS_strengthen_parliament: "의회 강화"
 CHS_strengthen_parliament_desc: "전 중국의 민주주의자들은 중국의 민주주의를 수호하고 권위주의자들이 새로운 공화국에서 다시는 권력을 얻지 못하게끔 의회의 권력을 강화하는 데에 찬성합니다."
 CHS_strengthen_presidency: "대총통 권한 강화"
 CHS_strengthen_presidency_desc: "The failure of the previous republican government shows that the government's powers must be clearly defined and the importance of the presidency to ensure stability and proper governance."
 CHS_xinhai_legacy: "신해혁명의 유산"
 CHS_xinhai_legacy_desc: "The Xinhai Revolution marks the birth of modern China and the Republic. It and its revolutionaries must be honoured and commemorated, as their legacy will live on as long as our Republic lives."
 CHS_national_protection_legacy: "호국의 유산"
 CHS_national_protection_legacy_desc: "The National Protection movements have become a symbol of our leaders' and armies' commitment to republicanism and constitutionalism, and they should be honoured along with the Xinhai Revolution that birthed our Republic, as they made sure that the Republic survived."
 CHS_federalist_model: "연성주의 모델"
 CHS_federalist_model_desc: "The Federalist movement in China has risen and fallen several times since the Xinhai Revolution, but they remain an important movement in our provisional government. A federal system will ensure that powers are properly separated and that local affairs remain in the hands of the locals who understand their own problems better than any central government."
 CHS_weaken_provincialism: "지방주의 공격"
 CHS_weaken_provincialism_desc: "Provincialism is a tool to divide our nation into fiefdoms and federalism is an attempt to institutionalise this. The supremacy of the central government must be ensured, for it is the only way China will be properly reunited as a single nation and not a collection of local tyrants."
 CHS_new_republic: "새로운 공화국"
 CHS_new_republic_desc: "With the lessons from the old Republic, we can build a new Republic. A new order in China, one that truly respects the legacy of its founders, republicanism, constitutionalism, and democracy, will be born and, this time, endure."
 CHS_personality_cult: "개인숭배"
 CHS_personality_cult_desc: "[Root.GetLeader] is the sole reason that the National Protection Alliance was able to crush the monarchists, radicals, and pretenders and restore the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution. Without him, there would be no Republic, and his legacy as liberator of China will endure."
 CHS_new_bureaucracy: "새로운 관료제"
 CHS_new_bureaucracy_desc: "From ruling a province or two to ruling the core of China, our bureaucracy has been struggling to say the least. Whether we adopted a federalist or centralist model, new civil servants need to be hired and the entire service must be reorganised from scratch."
 CHS_election: "새로운 국회 선거"
 CHS_election_desc: "The new government cannot hope to act legitimately as a Republic without assembling a new Parliament. New election to the National Assembly are to be held for the first time in decades (discounting illegitimate ones by the Manchu tyrants of course), helping bring legitimacy to our Provisional Government."
 CHS_national_reunification: "국가통일"
 CHS_national_reunification_desc: "With a new National Assembly gathered and a new Constitution ratified, our government is no longer provisional, but the sole legitimate government of China. President [Root.GetLeader] will lead the nation towards National Reunification, and China will be once again united and free. Long live the Republic!"
 CHS_reintegrate_academies: "Reintegrate Academies"
 CHS_reintegrate_academies_desc: "Military academies are scattered throughout China since before the Xinhai Revolution and have largely developed independently since the first collapse of the Qing Dynasty. They must be reintegrated and the curriculum of all officers standardised once more."
 CHS_standardised_arsenals: "표준화된 병공창"
 CHS_standardised_arsenals_desc: "For several decades, the arsenals of China have been under the control of different and largely independent provincial and national governments. Now that a number of those arsenals are under our control, the logistical issues stemming from different arsenals producing different arms in different calibre for a single army are substantial and should be rectified as soon as possible."
 CHS_fate_of_northern_officers: "북부 장교단의 운명"
 CHS_fate_of_northern_officers_desc: "Since the defeat of the Northern warlords, we have many officers as prisoners of war. Chen Jiongming believes we should be lenient, as many of them are competent and the majority are willing to pledge their allegiance to the new Republic. Not many share this optimism, however, and that they should serve as an example as traitors to China"
 CHS_small_arms_development: "소화기 개발"
 CHS_small_arms_development_desc: "Despite attempts by the numerous national and provincial governments to upgrade, the most widespread rifle in service remains the venerable, yet severely obsolete, Model 88. Making the standardisation on a new, modern rifle a reality rather than a project on paper is a top priority in order to improve our lacklustre military capabilities compared to other modern militaries."
 CHS_motorisation: "육군 차량화"
 CHS_motorisation_desc: "As the infrastructure of a unified China improves, not only is motorisation becoming a possibility, it is becoming a necessity due to the very size of our country. Increasing our mobility will increase our capabilities on and off the battlefield, allowing for greater flexibility and reach- especially in remote areas where bandits continue to prowl."
 CHS_artillery_modernisation: "포병 현대화"
 CHS_artillery_modernisation_desc: "Artillery is the king of the battlefield and modern pieces were a luxury in the warlord era. With the capabilities of a united China, we can modernise our guns and bring our firepower closer to the global standard."
 CHS_support_companies: "Army Support and Logistics"
 CHS_support_companies_desc: "Amateurs study tactics, masters study logistics. With a country as large and varied as China, this proverb must be taken seriously as many warlords learned the hard way. Improving our logistics will improve our armies' fighting capabilities far more than any modern firearm."
 CHS_tank_arsenal: "기갑병공창"
 CHS_tank_arsenal_desc: "The development of armoured warfare has certainly been noticed in China, but to develop and use them here was but a pipe dream. Now that we are united and stronger than ever, now is the time to delve into these advanced technologies. An arsenal dedicated to armoured vehicles should be founded as an important stepping stone in China's modernisation."
 CHS_aviation_school: "Formalise Aviation Schools"
 CHS_aviation_school_desc: "While there are indeed schools for pilots in China, they are few and relatively disorganised. Formalising these schools and creating a proper curriculum for pilots and maintenance crews will help create a proper air force for China."
 CHS_new_aircraft_factories: "새로운 항공기 공장"
 CHS_new_aircraft_factories_desc: "The South of the country has seen a number of small aircraft workshops created in the last decade or two, but remained fairly small, only able to repair what few planes there were. Creating proper factories is another step towards developing a fledging aeronautics industry, a staple of the modern era."
 CHS_native_fighter_design: "국산 전투기 설계"
 CHS_native_fighter_design_desc: "중국제 항공기를 개발하기 위한 시도는 수없이 이루어져 왔고 대부분은 외국제 항공기 설계에 기반을 둔 것이었습니다. 외국인 전문가의 지원과 점차 수가 늘어나고 있는 중국인 기술자들 덕분에 우린 영공을 지킬 현대적인 공군을 창설하겠다는 희망 하에 독자적인 항공기 설계를 그 어느 때보다도 제작할 수 있습니다."
 CHS_medium_bomber: "전술 폭격기 항공대"
 CHS_medium_bomber_desc: "Medium tactical bombers offer versatility to an air force with the ability to accomplish different types of mission. Of course, designing such a large plane has been unheard of until now and will certainly be a challenge."
 CHS_light_bomber: "육군 항공 지원"
 CHS_light_bomber_desc: "경폭격기들은 일종의 날아다니는 야포와도 같으며, 공군이 지상 작전을 지원하기 가장 좋은 방법입니다. 우리가 현대적인 공군을 창설하기 위해서는 당연히 이러한 근접항공지원기에 집중해야 합니다."
 CHS_southern_fleets_legacy: "남양함대의 유산"
 CHS_southern_fleets_legacy_desc: "광둥함대(혹은 남양함대)는 짧지만 격동적인 역사를 지녔습니다. 19세기 후반에 창설된 이후로, 함대에 대한 투자 자금은 상하이 주둔 난양함대에 빼돌려졌고, 청불전쟁과 청일전쟁에 참전하여 작은 성과를 거두었으며, 신해혁명 이전에 처량하게 해산되었습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 광둥함대는 4개의 현대적인 중국 해군 중 하나였으며, 그 영광은 아직까지도 기억 속에 남아있습니다."
 CHS_naval_academy: "해군군관학교 부활"
 CHS_naval_academy_desc: "The naval academies of China have been largely neglected through successive national and provincial governments. Now that there is a single, uncontested Central Government once more, we have the ability to renew naval interests and support a new cadre of officers for the Republican Navy."
 CHS_destroyers: "현대 구축함 전대"
 CHS_destroyers_desc: "Destroyers are the backbone of any modern navy, especially one as fledging as China's. They will protect our coasts, shipping lanes and larger warships from submarines and small attack crafts."
 CHS_submarines: "잠수함 개발"
 CHS_submarines_desc: "Submarines are proving to be indispensable in modern naval warfare. For a navy as limited as ours, they may prove to be a life saver, allowing us to attack far stronger enemies by raiding their shipping lanes and harassing their larger fleets."
 CHS_cruisers: "함대 지원 순양함"
 CHS_cruisers_desc: "Cruisers are important for scouting and screening and, realistically speaking, may be the largest warships we are capable of building at this time."
 CHS_coastal_defence: "해안 방어에 집중"
 CHS_coastal_defence_desc: "It would be insane to start planning for a large fleet capable of rivaling the naval Great Powers. As such, we must focus on a more flexible navy capable to protecting our long coast and interests in the Pacific."
 CHS_grand_fleet: "대함대?"
 CHS_grand_fleet_desc: "중국이 언젠가 이루어야할 강대국의 지위를 갖기 위해서 해군이 반드시 필요합니다. 비록 이것이 초장기적인 계획이 될 것임이 틀림없지만, 우리의 위대한 해군은 언젠가 발걸음을 뗴야하고 그 시기는 바로 지금이어야 합니다."
 CHS_naval_bomber: "뇌격기 계획"
 CHS_naval_bomber_desc: "처음엔 무시받았던 어뢰 및 철갑폭탄으로 무장한 해군 폭격기들은 이제 해상에서 현존하는 가장 거대한 전함에게도 심각한 위협으로 다가옵니다. 이 기술이 우리 해안가를 위협하는 매우 거대한 적 함대를 파괴할 가격 대비 효과가 뛰어난 방법으로서 중국이 필요로 하는 기술일 것입니다."
 npa.1.t: "호국동맹 형성"
 npa.1.d: "For too long has Beijing betrayed the Chinese nation. From supporting dictators to monarchists, we can no longer sit idly as the north continues to erode our great nation. The provincial leaders of the south must band together once more and restore the National Protection movement to overthrow them once and for all. A new republic will bring greatness to China once more!"
 npa.1.a: "민국 만세!"
 npa.2.t: "A Request from [From.GetLeader]"
 npa.2.d: "[From.GetLeader] has made a formal request to join the National Protection Alliance. While unity should come first against the north, it would be unwise to accept the request without properly considering the consequences of a potential betrayal."
 npa.2.a: "Of course!"
 npa.2.b: "It would be unwise."
 npa.3.t: "[ROOT.GetLeader] Accepted into the NPA"
 npa.3.d: "Our province has been welcomed into the National Protection Alliance. We shall now prepare for the inevitable Second Northern Expedition that will surely bring the Beijing government to their knees!"
 npa.3.a: "For the Republic!"
 npa.4.t: "[ROOT.GetLeader] Refused into the NPA"
 npa.4.d: "Our request has been denied; [From.GetLeader] has refused to allow us into the National Protection Alliance."
 npa.4.a: "How rude!"
 npa.5.t: "An Invitation from [From.GetLeader]"
 npa.5.d: "[From.GetLeader], leader of the National Protection Alliance, has officially invited us to join the movement to overthrow the Beijing regime. The alliance, like the previous National Protection movement, is a loose one composed of varied provincial leaders with varied levels of ambition. While this will empower [From.GetLeader]'s influence in the region, it could potentially cement our own position both regionally and nationally, and a potential power struggle after taking Beijing could potentially benefit us."
 npa.5.a: "우리는 단결해야만 한다!"
 npa.5.b: "거절하자."
 npa.6.t: "[From.GetLeader] Joins!"
 npa.6.d: "[From.GetLeader] has accepted our offer, joining the National Protection Alliance. We are one step closer from being able to conquer the north!"
 npa.6.a: "Excellent!"
 npa.7.t: "[From.GetLeader]의 거부"
 npa.7.d: "[From.GetLeader] has refused to join the National Protection Alliance. We will have to deal with him later or make due without him."
 npa.7.a: "Traitor!"
 npa.8.t: "Beijing Liberated"
 npa.8.d: "With the former imperial capital under the National Protection Alliance's control, we are finally able to restore the Republic and honour the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution. As the leader of the Alliance, it is our duty to proclaim a new Provisional Government and take our place as the leaders of the new Central Government of China."
 npa.8.a: "민국 만세!"

 npa.9.d: "With our allies firmly behind us, we can now begin the monumental task of rebuilding China and the Republic."
 npa.9.a: "민국 만세!"
 npa.10.t: "Formation of the Provisional Government"
 npa.10.d: "With the former imperial capital under the National Protection Alliance's control, we are finally able to restore the Republic and honour the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution. [From.GetLeader], the leader of the Alliance, has invited us to join him to create a new provisional government. This will put us firmly under his leadership and we shall support him in the great task ahead."
 npa.10.a: "Very well."
 npa.10.b: "[From.GetLeader] is not fit to lead!"
 npa.11.t: "(( Processing Power Struggle... ))"
 npa.11.d: "This is a hidden event. If you see this, then I, Vidyaország, have fucked up, or you cheated. Please submit a bug report if you see this. Thank you."
 npa.11.a: "Beep boop"
 npa.12.t: "권력 투쟁"
 npa.12.d: "The fragile alliance that was the NPA has been shattered. Some of our former allies have turned on us, declaring us incapable to leading the new Republic and our provisional government illegitimate.\n\nIt appears that another round of civil war has begun."
 npa.12.a: "Traitors! Backstabbers!"
 npa.13.t: "(( Finalising Power Struggle... ))"
 npa.13.d: "This is a hidden event. If you see this, then I, Vidyaország, have fucked up (or you cheated). Please submit a bug report if you see this. Thank you."

 npa.14.t: "Provisional Government Secured"
 npa.14.d: "With all other claimants subdued, we have secured our position as head of the provisional government. We can now begin the monumental task of rebuilding China and the Republic."
 npa.14.a: "민국 만세!"
 npa.15.t: "Formation of the National Protection Association"
 npa.15.d: "With the formation of the Provisional Government, a number of Chinese politicians, from militarists and businessmen to shameless sycophants, have banded together to form a political party: the National Protection Association. Seeking to secure the new republic and the legacy of the National Protection movement, this pro-government party only seeks to support our policies and gather public support for them. This guarantees us many voices in the future parliament of China and significant political power as we transition from a provincial government to a national one."
 npa.15.a: "A needed presence in the National Assembly."
 npa.16.t: "Reinstating the Constitution of 1924"
 npa.16.d: "The final constitution of the Republic of China was adopted in its waning years to replace the old Provisional Constitutions. While the new one proved to be just as provisional, the new Provisional Government has, unsurprisingly, decided to reinstate it until a new one can be decided. Hopefully, the new and final Constitution will be drafted in a timely manner unlike the turbulent times of the first Republic."
 npa.16.a: "It's only provisional... right?"
 npa.17.t: "The [GetYear] National Assembly Election"
 npa.17.d: "The time has come to finally elect representatives for the new legislature. Because of the political and constitutional situation, pro-government candidates run virtually unopposed due to the relatively narrow electorate and the election's boycotting by radicals. While this may not foster political pluralism, it will ensure that the legislature will support our policies, thus making sure that the Republic remains stable in its first years."
 npa.17.a: "민국 만세!"
 npa.19.t: "중앙정부의 최후통첩"
 npa.19.d: "The new Central Government has demanded that we recognise them as the legitimate government of China. This would mean integration into the new Republic and a significant loss of autonomy."
 npa.19.a: "Accept"
 npa.19.b: "Refuse"
 npa.20.t: "[From.GetLeader] Accepts"
 npa.20.d: "[From.GetLeader] of [From.GetNameDef] has accepted our demands and recognised us as the legitimate government of China. They will be integrated into the new Republic."

 npa.21.t: "[From.GetLeader]의 거부"
 npa.21.d: "[From.GetLeader] of [From.GetNameDef] has refused to recognise us as the legitimate government of China. Their insolence will make a fine example for the others that refuse to submit."

 CHS_NPA_second_northern_expedition_desc: "Invading the North is a very difficult feat, as demonstrated by the Kuomintang's attempt that led to their demise.
