 LOAS_Arab_League: "$LOAS_faction$"
 LOAS_Arab_League_desc: "United by language, the Arab people have always formed a distinct group within the empires they inhabited. Some people however feel that this connection doesn't go far enough and that it's the destiny of the Arab world to reunite such as in the times of the great Caliphates. They believe that through the creation of such a united Arabia, the entire subcontinent will finally experience its true renaissance and retake its position in global politics.\n\nTo hasten this unification, a supranational organisation (§Y$LOAS_faction$§!) has been created and granted significant power. Should the dream of a Pan-Arab state ever want to be realised however, we will need to convince the other Arab states to partake in this initiative and give up part of their sovereignty."
