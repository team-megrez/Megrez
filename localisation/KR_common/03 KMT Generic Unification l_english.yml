 KMT_white_sun_desc: "비록 그 과정이 힘겨웠을지언정, 우리는 마침내 국가 전역에 우리의 통치를 공고히 했고, 공식적으로 백일 아래의 민국을 형성할 수 있습니다. 우리는 이제 중국의 모든 지방을 우리 정부 기관에 종속시켜 혁명의 다음 단계를 위한 토대를 마련해야 합니다. "
 KMT_tridemism: "삼민주의"
 KMT_tridemism_desc: "삼민주의는 쑨원의 정치철학과 국민당의 기초가 되는 이론입니다. 삼민주의는 우리 정부의 정책과 결정의 지침이 되어주기에, 다가오는 전쟁에서 민중들은 삼민주의의 중요성을 이해해야 합니다. "
 KMT_organic_law: "민국의 유기적인 법률"
 KMT_organic_law_desc: "While Political Tutelage continues and the final Constitution is drafted, the Organic Law of the National Government has been promulgated. This act reorganised the National Government into five branches, or Yuan, and reinforced the Kuomintang's exercise of sovereign power for the duration of Political Tutelage."
 KMT_minzu_focus: "민족"
 KMT_minzu_focus_desc: "Minzu, or Nationalism, is one of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and revolves around a common livelihood, language, religion, customs, and most importantly, a shared bloodline. National unity is paramount to our success, and shall allow China to succeed against other nations in the struggle for supremacy."
 KMT_minquan_focus: "민권"
 KMT_minquan_focus_desc: "Minquan, or Democracy, is the second of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Creating democratic institutions and preparing the Chinese people for them is one of the most important objectives of the National Revolution and will, in the long-run, prove that the Party is the best choice for China."
 KMT_legislature: "입법원"
 KMT_legislature_desc: "While China is not anywhere ready for full elections, the Nationalist Government needs to begin forming the institutions that democracy will, one day, make its will known through. The Legislative Yuan, staffed by KMT representatives from both controlled and contested territories, will take over legislative responsibilities from the Central Committee."
 KMT_land_reform: "민족주의 토지개혁"
 KMT_land_reform_desc: "Peasants form the absolute majority of the Chinese population yet few of them own the land they work, killing any chance of socio-economic advancement. Land reform is a necessity to improve their livelihoods and reduce social tensions. Until the peasants of China own the land instead of leasing it from corrupt landlords, they will never be free."
 KMT_rent_control: "토지가치세"
 KMT_rent_control_desc: "Sun Yat-sen pushed for a Land Value Tax to be adopted in order to improve the country's finances, help push for land reform, and create a fairer taxation and economic system. We must implement his vision to help modernise the country and improve the economy."
 KMT_minsheng: "민생"
 KMT_minsheng_desc: "Minsheng, commonly translated as 'The People's Welfare', is the last of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Following the implementation of a land value tax, social programmes will be created and expanded in order to help peasants and workers improve their quality of life by subsidising food consumption, clothing and housing costs."
 KMT_revive_china: "중국 계획 개정"
 KMT_revive_china_desc: "Without the Nationalist Party, there will be no new China. A vast programme of extensive state planning and initiatives is necessary to bring China back up to the same level as the West and alleviate the damaged economy."
 KMT_national_mausoleum: "국립묘지 건설"
 KMT_national_mausoleum_desc: "It is long past due to honour those who have fallen in service of Chinese Democracy. A national mausoleum will be constructed outside of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to house the remains of Sun Yat-Sen and other prominent revolutionaries."
 KMT_civil_service: "공공 서비스 확대"
 KMT_civil_service_desc: "To endure in the long run, the Nationalist Government must be more than a warlord clique or a party-state. A civil service that is independent of both the Kuomintang party apparatus and the army must begin formation."
 KMT_academia_sinica: "중앙연구원"
 KMT_academia_sinica_desc: "To better foster the development of our native scientific capabilities, the KMT must commit to creating and sponsoring our own academic research institutions. Long proposed but never enacted, the fully established Academica Sinica will be the centre of these efforts."
 KMT_national_reconstruction_commission: "국가재건위원회"
 KMT_national_reconstruction_commission_desc: "Inspired by proposals drafted by Zhang Renjie, a centrally-directed National Reconstruction Commission should be formed by the Nationalist Government to plan a nationwide programme of capital investments and standardisations. This programme will involve multiple independently-scaling efforts centred around several major population centres."
 KMT_bopomofo: "보, 포, 모, 포..."
 KMT_bopomofo_desc: "The current methods for romanising Mandarin Chinese and even teaching the Chinese script are woefully inadequate for children or the everyday person. A new standard for phonetic symbols, similar to the Hiragana syllabary created for Japanese, should be created and spread throughout our educational system to help standardise the Chinese dialects and open mass conversation with the West."
 KMT_triumphant_revolution: "성공적인 혁명"
 KMT_triumphant_revolution_desc: "China has finally been reunited under the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth of the Kuomintang. While there is still a long way to go before we recover from the Century of Humiliation, we have fulfilled the dream of the late Dr. Sun."
 KMT_renovate_whampoa: "황포군관학교 확장"
 KMT_renovate_whampoa_desc: "The Kuomintang Military Academy was first founded by Sun Yat-sen in 1924 in Whampoa near Guangzhou and created a cadre of politically-conscious officers from those who trained there. While simply restoring it was sufficient previously, the transformation of the NRA into a truly national army requires Whampoa to be expanded in order to fill the need for politically reliable and capable officers."
 KMT_central_military_academy: "중앙사관학교 설립"
 KMT_central_military_academy_desc: "With the revolution's hold over China secure, there is no longer any need for the Whampoa Military Academy to remain in Guangzhou. The distinguished military school will be moved to our national capital to create a centralised military academy. This will help our central command structure and encourage recruits from all across the country to learn from the best officers China has to offer."
 KMT_standardised_arsenals: "병공창 표준화"
 KMT_standardised_arsenals_desc: "For several decades, the arsenals of China have been under the control of different and largely independent provincial and national governments. Now that a number of those arsenals are under our control, the logistical issues stemming from different arsenals producing different arms in different calibre for a single army are substantial and should be rectified as soon as possible."
 KMT_small_arms_development: "소화기 개발"
 KMT_small_arms_development_desc: "Despite attempts by the numerous national and provincial governments to upgrade, the most widespread rifle in service remains the venerable, yet severely obsolete, Model 88. Making the standardisation on a new, modern rifle a reality rather than a project on paper is a top priority in order to improve our lacklustre military capabilities compared to other modern militaries."
 KMT_artillery_modernisation: "포병 현대화"
 KMT_artillery_modernisation_desc: "Artillery is the king of the battlefield and modern pieces were a luxury in the warlord era. With the capabilities of a united China, we can modernise our guns and bring our firepower closer to the global standard."
 KMT_tank_arsenal: "기갑전"
 KMT_tank_arsenal_desc: "The development of armoured warfare has certainly been noticed in China, but to develop and use them here was but a pipe dream. Now that we are united and stronger than ever, now is the time to delve into these advanced technologies as an important stepping stone in China's modernisation."
 KMT_new_model_army: "신식군"
 KMT_new_model_army_desc: "A professional volunteer army will be the future of the Chinese army: a smaller army devoted to the Three Principles of the People and the National Revolution, focusing on quality over quantity. This will create a greater Esprit de Corps and discipline, creating better soldiers that can perform difficult tasks and follow difficult orders."
 KMT_professionalisation: "군대 규율 주입"
 KMT_professionalisation_desc: "The new Chinese army will be a professional one, focusing on military training full-time, encouraging high levels of discipline and skill. The example of the Iron Army will become a model for modern professional armies comparable to any Western power."
 KMT_peoples_army: "인민군"
 KMT_peoples_army_desc: "The Chinese Army should take advantage of its manpower and size to fight wars. It should be a People's Army: One that represents the people and protects it. A pillar of national unification, not one of oppression or repression."
 KMT_conscription: "병역을 통한 결속"
 KMT_conscription_desc: "Widespread military service brings people from many regions together, giving them shared experiences and helping them see one another as brethren; concrete and true examples of brotherhood instead of vague concepts of nationhood. National unity will be strengthened by it."
 KMT_NRA: "국부군의 회생"
 KMT_NRA_desc: "Despite the NRA's problems after the unification, we have succeeded in our reforms to modernise and equip the NRA for future conflicts. Every day, we receive new and eager recruits ready to be taught by battle-hardened veterans of the NRA. As the true army of the Chinese Republic, our armed forces shall be a testament to the success of Chinese modernisation for generations to come. Long live the National Revolutionary Army, long live the Chinese Kuomintang!"
 KMT_aviation_school: "Formalise Aviation Schools"
 KMT_aviation_school_desc: "While there are indeed schools for pilots in China, they are few and relatively disorganised. Formalising these schools and creating a proper curriculum for pilots and maintenance crews will help create a proper air force for China."
 KMT_new_aircraft_factories: "New Aircraft Factories"
 KMT_new_aircraft_factories_desc: "The South of the country has seen a number of small aircraft workshops created in the last decade or two, but remained fairly small, only able to repair what few planes there were. Creating proper factories is another step towards developing a fledging aeronautics industry, a staple of the modern era."
 KMT_native_fighter_design: "Domestic Fighter Design"
 KMT_native_fighter_design_desc: "There have been a number of attempts at creating a Chinese aircraft, mostly based on foreign designs. With the help of foreign experts and an increasing pool of local technicians, we are now more than ever able to develop our own designs in the hopes of creating a modern air force to defend our skies."
 KMT_naval_bomber: "Naval Bomber Project"
 KMT_naval_bomber_desc: "While ignored at first, naval bombers armed with torpedoes and armour-piercing bombs are quickly becoming a serious threat to even the largest warships currently at sea. This technology might be exactly what China needs: A cost-effective way of destroying a vastly-larger enemy fleet threatening our coastline."
 KMT_medium_bomber: "Tactical Bomber Fleet"
 KMT_medium_bomber_desc: "Medium tactical bombers offer versatility to an air force with the ability to accomplish different types of mission. Of course, designing such a large plane has been unheard of until now and will certainly be a challenge."
 KMT_light_bomber: "Army Air Support"
 KMT_light_bomber_desc: "Light bombers as some kind of flying artillery is the best way an air force can support land operations. It is only logical that we focus on these close-air-support crafts as we forge a modern air force."
 KMT_expand_dockyard: "Expand Republican Dockyards"
 KMT_expand_dockyard_desc: "With the completion of the national unification and the fulfilment of Dr. Sun's vision, we must now take steps to transform our once fledgling provincial naval forces into the new national navy. Let us revive the Republic of China Navy under the flag of the White Sun and encourage the construction of dockyards across the coast of China to meet our growing need for ships."
 KMT_incorporate_beiyang_fleet: "Incorporate the Beiyang Fleet"
 KMT_incorporate_beiyang_fleet_desc: "As a result of the unification wars, some of China's best admirals and naval officers now find themselves out of work since the National Unification. We shall offer them full government amnesty so that these naval officers can train and lead the next generation of Chinese sailors on the high seas as part of China's new revolutionary navy."
 KMT_destroyers: "Modern Destroyer Flotilla"
 KMT_destroyers_desc: "Destroyers are the backbone of any modern navy, especially one as fledging as China's. They will protect our coasts, shipping lanes and larger warships from submarines and small attack crafts."
 KMT_submarines: "잠수함 개발"
 KMT_submarines_desc: "Submarines are proving to be indispensable in modern naval warfare. For a navy as limited as ours, they may prove to be a life saver, allowing us to attack far stronger enemies by raiding their shipping lanes and harassing their larger fleets."
 KMT_cruisers: "함대 지원 순양함"
 KMT_cruisers_desc: "Cruisers are important for scouting and screening and, realistically speaking, may be the largest warships we are capable of building at this time."
 KMT_coastal_defence: "해안 방어에 집중"
 KMT_coastal_defence_desc: "It would be insane to start planning for a large fleet capable of rivalling the naval Great Powers. As such, we must focus on a more flexible navy capable to protecting our long coast and interests in the Pacific."
 KMT_grand_fleet: "대함대"
 KMT_grand_fleet_desc: "중국이 언젠가 이루어야할 강대국의 지위를 갖기 위해서 해군이 반드시 필요합니다. 비록 이것이 초장기적인 계획이 될 것임이 틀림없지만, 우리의 위대한 해군은 언젠가 발걸음을 뗴야하고 그 시기는 바로 지금이어야 합니다."
 KMT_revolution_minsheng: "삼민주의"
 KMT_economy_1: "활성화된 경제"
 KMT_model_army_1: "신식군"
 KMT_peoples_army_1: "인민군"
