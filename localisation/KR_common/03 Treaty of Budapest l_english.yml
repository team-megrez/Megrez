 treaty_of_budapest_events.0.t: "The Fall of Austria"
 treaty_of_budapest_events.0.d: "It has become increasingly clear, with both the Armee-Oberkommando (Army High Command) and the Foreign Ministry in panic, that the war with our upstart neighbours has taken a turn for the worse. With the core of the monarchy threatened, even the once-confident AOK is fearing for the worst and that not only is the territorial integrity of the Empire no longer salvageable, but that it may already be at the doorstep of complete collapse. To save face and prevent this potential collapse, it has been suggested to the Emperor-King that we must sue for peace or face the dismantlement of the Habsburg Monarchy altogether."

With the core of the monarchy threatened, even the once-confident AOK fears we are at the doorstep of complete collapse. It has been suggested to the Emperor-King that we must sue for peace... though we could possibly ask for German intervention to ensure that the core of Austria remains intact. If we do so, the Germans will undoubtedly ask for us to accept their permanent alliance and protection. Our only alternative is to place ourselves at [AUS_belgrade_pact_leader.GetAdjective] mercy."
 treaty_of_budapest_events.0.a: "We are beaten. Sue for peace."

 treaty_of_budapest_events.1.t: "Austria Sues For Peace"
 treaty_of_budapest_events.1.t.germany: "Austria and Germany Sue For Peace"
 treaty_of_budapest_events.1.d.main: "The tyrannical Habsburg Monarchy's troops have been beaten on the field by our glorious liberating armies. Even the decrepit head of the rotten empire is seeing his inevitable demise and has sued for peace. They are willing to cede all of our claims, as they are desperate to salvage what is left. With our aims achieved, there is little reason to refuse this generous offer even if the prospect of marching through Vienna's Heldenplatz and finishing off the dying corpse of an Empire is indeed tempting."

Even the decrepit head of the rotten empire is seeing his inevitable demise and has sued for peace. They are willing to cede all of our claims, as they are desperate to salvage what is left. With our aims achieved, and [From.GetNameDef] having already agreed to their offer, there is little reason to refuse even if the prospect of marching through Vienna's Heldenplatz and finishing off the dying corpse of an Empire is indeed tempting."

Even the decrepit head of the rotten empire is seeing his inevitable demise and has sued for peace. They are willing to cede all of our claims, as they are desperate to salvage what is left. With our aims achieved, there is little reason to refuse - though [From.GetNameDef] has informed us that they will continue the war. Apparently, the thought of their troops marching through Vienna's Heldenplatz and finishing off the dying corpse of an Empire is too tempting."
 treaty_of_budapest_events.1.d.germany.main1: "The tyrannical Habsburg Monarchy's troops have been beaten on the field by our glorious liberating armies, enough that they not only wish to sue for peace but have also run to the Germans for protection. [GER.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to allow us any claims which do not impede on what they consider 'core' Austrian lands, so long as we make peace. Failure to do so will mean war with the entire Reichspakt."

[GER.GetNameDefCap] has dictated that no core Austrian lands will be annexed... which means we would get *nothing* from the treaty. This alone is an outrage, but if we refuse it means war with the entire Reichspakt."

[GER.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to allow us any claims which do not impede on what they consider core Austrian lands - an offer that [From.GetNameDef] has already hotly refused. Do we join in with [From.GetNameDef] and go to war with the Reichspakt itself, or do we break with them and accept the German-dictated peace?"
 treaty_of_budapest_events.1.a: "We agree to their terms."
 treaty_of_budapest_events.1.b: "No, we shall end the Habsburgs once and for all!"

 treaty_of_budapest_events.2.d.germany: "Delegates from the Habsburg Monarchy and [GER.GetNameDef] met with counterparts from enemy nations in Budapest to hammer out the peace terms. Austria has agreed to cede all claims their enemies have on Imperial and Royal lands in exchange for peace. This humiliating defeat marks a new chapter in Habsburg history as Austria can no longer consider itself to be a Great Power. However, it may be able to salvage what is left and avoid the complete dismantling of its monarchy now that it is under German protection."

 treaty_of_budapest_events.3.d.germany.italy: "Delegates from [Root.GetNameDef] met with their German and Habsburg counterparts in Budapest to hammer out the peace terms. Our gains in the ensuing treaty will be limited, as Germany is determined to protect 'core' Austrian lands in the Littoral and Alto Adige which happen to mostly be Italian as well. Still, it means peace for now and no war with the Reichspakt."

 treaty_of_budapest_events.5.d: "Our choice to accept the peace offer from the Austrians seems to have greatly angered our erstwhile allies in [FROM.GetNameDef].

It appears our alliance with [FROM.GetNameDef] is at an end."
 treaty_of_budapest_events.5.a: "They will regret this when the Austrians turn towards them."

 treaty_of_budapest_events.6.d: "A new chapter opens for the Habsburg Monarchy as their forces have been defeated by [AUS_belgrade_pact_leader.GetNameDef] and her allies. Once one of the dominant forces in the Balkans, Austria has seen continuous decline for decades and, while their hollow victory in the Weltkrieg brought a brief respite, this war may have finally brought down the once-proud Empire. The map of the Balkans and Central Europe has been redrawn once more; Austria can no longer consider herself a Great Power while her neighbours have reunited with their national brethren once firmly under Habsburg control."

Swallowing their pride, they have come to [Root.GetNameDef] to ask for our intervention and protection. With us at the peace talks, we can ensure the Austrians are not dismantled completely, and in exchange they and their remaining subjects will join the Reichspakt alliance.
