 prewar.1.d: "5년 전 오늘, 제네바의 노동자들은 이 쟁의가 (로망디로 알려진) 스위스 서부의 프랑스어권 지역으로 퍼져나갈 것이라고 위협하며 경제적 사회적 개혁을 요구하는 주요 노동 쟁의를 시작했습니다. 프랑스 코뮌이 잠재적으로 혁명에 영향을 끼칠 것을 두려워한 베른의 중앙 정부는 파업을 멈추기 위해 연방 군대를 파견하여 신속하게 대응했습니다. 뒤이은 폭력 사태로 제네바에서 13명이 숨졌고 100명이 넘는 사람이 다쳤습니다. 이 사건으로 베른과 로만디 간에 쓰디쓴 불화가 남았고, 이는 이후 몇년 동안 치유되지 못했습니다. 최근 프랑스의 발전에 고무된 급진 좌파 세력은 다시 한번 요구하기 시작했고 다가오는 지방 선거에 사회당 후보들을 출마시킬 예정입니다. 하지만 전통적으로 로만디를 텃밭으로 가지고 있는 사회민주당은 노동 조합과 함께 임금 인상, 근로 시간 등 많은 정책을 포함하는 \"노동의 평화\" 개혁안을 만들어냈습니다. 이 계혁의 핵심 중 하나는 최근 일어난 시계 제조사들의 대규모 공장폐쇄를 끝내는 것입니다. 사회민주당 후보는 이 개혁으로 재선될 것이라고 기대하고 있으며, 이 개혁이 베른 연방 정부의 보수파와 급진 좌파 사이의 대치 상황을 완화해주기를 희망합니다."

While the moderate social-democrats have been disgraced, French-speaking workers, whose resentment towards the current government and the Federal Army (largely dominated by German-speaking officers) has been growing since the violent repression of a workers' strike in Geneva in 1932, have returned a landslide victory to Socialist and pro-Syndicalist candidates in all cantonal elections, bringing in leftist councils in Geneva, Lausanne and Neuchâtel which are now calling for ambitious reforms."

The situation is getting too dangerous and a move to force the Socialist governments to step down and have new elections in the Romandie seems inevitable, even if it means temporary military occupation of the Romandie by the Federal army. But with the violence in Haute-Savoie agitating the French, the risk of triggering an armed response is high, though, and we cannot be sure of the Reichspakt's support..."

 prewar.6.d: "The Federal Council, backed up by local French-speaking conservatives, has ordered \"sure\" (i.e. German-speaking) Federal Army units to enter Romand cantons to introduce martial law. Socialist leaders, as well as many workers and Syndicalist sympathisers, have been arrested and provisional local governments are being set up under Federal supervision. In spite of our efforts, some Socialist councilors have managed to escape to France and they are now calling for armed resistance against Federal rule and the return of Haute-Savoie to French hands. Despite the repression, the Romandie and now Haute-Savoie are now being plagued by massive strikes and armed incidents as demobilised French speaking Army units form militias. Meanwhile, an unusual concentration of French infantry and tanks is currently exercising in the Jura Mountains, and violation of Swiss airspace by French aircraft is becoming more and more frequent."

As if that were not enough, now too they beat and bloody Frenchmen on our own soil in Savoie! Our agents have reported numerous atrocities against armed workers and civilians as the Swiss Federal Army has implemented martial law. Despite their best efforts, some French-speaking syndicalist sympathisers have evaded the Federal Army and found a safe haven in our country. They have just set up a Syndicalist Swiss-French government-in-exile and call for the restoration of properly elected officials and the prosecution of the current federal government. Since none of the reactionary Powers seem to be willing to come to Switzerland's rescue, this is a one-time opportunity to send an ultimatum to Bern and both empower Syndicalist movements in our neighbour and see the return of our rightful territory."

After several clashes between German-speaking soldiers in training and Geneva policemen, the Romand socialist leaders, pressed by the worker's militias, have proclaimed secession from Switzerland and the constitution of a so-called \"Romand Socialist Federation\". According to intelligence reports, the French and the secessionists have engaged in talks about an union between the Romand cantons and the Commune of France.

French state broadcasters have announced that the Romandie has been annexed to the Commune of France, all the while routed soldiers and refugees are arriving in Bern in the thousands.

As thousands stream across the border to seek asylum in France, French-speaking militiamen are executed after mock trials, while right-wing activists and bourgeois hunt down Socialists, Anarchists and Syndicalists, loot their homes and take gruesome revenge on their families. Such atrocities, reported by our state broadcasters, are causing an uproar in France and every true Syndicalist is now ready to free not only Savoie but even the Romands from the clutches of Switzerland's bloodthirsty rulers. As our aircraft are ready to take off and strike against Swiss territory and our troops are concentrating near the border, the Comité de Salut Public has informed Bern that should Haute-Savoie not be evacuated by the Swiss Federal Army and its control transferred to Communal authorities, and Romand political leaders reinstated to their positions, war would be inevitable."

 prewar.31.d: "The rampant rebellion of the French-speaking minority around Metz has recently worsened. Those people, whose preposterous calls for cultural autonomy have never ceased in spite of the French defeat and a comprehensive policy of Germanisation of the area, have become more arrogant after the Swiss have cowardly given in to the French demands and the leftist Romandie has been annexed by the Commune. As the reunion of Lothringen to the Reich was to be remembered in Metz with a massive military parade and speeches from high-ranking officials, and even if tens of pro-French local leaders and identified Syndicalists had been put under preemptive arrest, the celebrations have been interrupted by massive riots in Metz as well as in the whole area up to Metz. Official buildings have been set on fire, armed squads have opened fire against the police on the Platz des Kaisers and the Statthalter has barely escaped an assassination attempt in the town hall, while German-speaking homes, shops and factories have been looted by the populace and many German-speaking civilian assaulted or even murdered; in the countryside and the industrial towns, local representatives of the Reich are targeted by terrorist cells. Mine workers in French-speaking Lothringen are now on strike and despite a swift and ruthless repression, the situation is now getting out of control. Supported by the nationalist feelings of the common people, DVNP members of the Reichstag are calling for a massive deportation of French-speaking people from Lothringen to Silesia and Eastern Prussia; Lothringen and parts of Elsaß are now under martial law, troops are coming from all parts of the Reich to squash the rebellion, and the Kaiser has demanded immediate action to restore order in Lothringen."

 prewar.32.t: "메츠에서의 무력충돌"
 prewar.32.d: "As Germany celebrates the 20th anniversary of the Victory and the reunion of all of Lothringen to the Reich, the festivities that took place in the city of Metz have been tarnished by violent demonstrations from the French-speaking minority, who never fully integrated in our Empire and is still complaining about economic discrimination and social repression. As the military parade and speeches from the Statthalter were met by insults and catcalls from the populace, the demonstration has worsened and turned into a riot; official buildings have been attacked by armed protestors, killing two policemen, and a number of German-speaking civilians have been assaulted by the mob. Even if the police has regained control of the streets and many demonstrators, including French-speaking militant leaders, have been put under arrest, the situation is still extremely tense. Mine workers from French-speaking Lothringen have went on strike and discontent is fuelled by French propaganda. In Berlin, where the public opinion calls for drastic measures, the cabinet is about to put Lothringen under military administration until law and order are restored."

 prewar.34.d: "In spite of a ruthless policy of Germanisation and repression of Syndicalist activity, our lost fellow comrades from Lorraine have revolted again the Kaiser's rule. During a provocative celebration of the twentieth anniversary of German occupation, thousands of French-speaking Lorrains have taken control of Metz and other areas in Lorraine, raising the red flag upon their town halls and closing down every mine and factory. However, brute force is now suppressing the Lorrains struggle for freedom and social justice and despite undercover help from our intelligence services, the German police, supported by army detachments, has put hundreds under arrest, while extrajudicial executions have been reported in Longwy and mining cities are under martial law. Put under pressure by the outraged French people, the Comité de Salut Public is discussing the General Staff's proposal to perform a show of force at the German border in an attempt to come to the French-speaking militant's rescue."

In this regard, at the request of the Kaiser, his grandson and future Kronprinz Prince Wilhelm von Preußen will attend the military exercise organised in Alsace-Lorraine under the name \"Tüchtiger Bogenschütze\" (the name was chosen because new long-range artillery prototypes from Krupp factories are to be tested in real conditions during the exercise), which will be the largest concentration of troops since the Weltkrieg. No less than eight divisions will be deployed near the French border, where fortifications have been fully manned. Three air regiments and armoured units will also take part in the operations, which will be followed by many European military attachés.

Four infantry divisions and two motorised infantry divisions, with their divisional artillery units, will face the Germans near Belfort, while bomber and fighter wings will train in coordination with an armoured division equipped with the newest medium and heavy tanks.

At least two artillery batteries have opened fire across the border and have shelled Avricourt, a small and undefended village near Nancy. Twelve buildings have been destroyed and 26 people, mostly women and children, have been slaughtered in this cowardly attack. The survivors are being evacuated as border troops, reinforced with longe-range artillery, are now facing the murderous German units. An emergency session is being held at the Bourse Générale du Travail, while the Chief of Staff has just come back with his aides from Besançon to Paris to consider the most appropriate response to such a despicable attack."

A tank platoon, misguided by faulty map directions, apparently drove a little too close to the border. The crew, however, insisted that they were still on the French side when the trigger-happy German border-guards open fired on them. Regardless, a firefight broke out near a small Lorraine village named Elfringen and there were casualties on both sides. Military intelligence officers have been immediately sent on the spot to investigate and the commanding lieutenant has been put under preventative arrest. However, the warmongering Germans are outrageously taking advantage of this incident. The Comité de Salut Public has just received an insulting ultimatum from Berlin, demanding an official apology and the ending of our military exercise with the threat of \"extremely severe consequences\" if we don't comply."

Our Foreign minister, as well as our allies from the Internationale, have asked the Comité de Salut Public to accept this apology. However, such a decision would certainly disappoint a now revengeful and bellicist French public opinion; more importantly, during an extremely tense secret meeting with the CSP, the General Staff has warned that, should the German apology be accepted without further compensations, the Army would not yield to the civil power's decisions without internal dissent and attempts to mutiny."

War seems now imminent: however, moderate members of the Bourse Générale du Travail are worrying about our level of operational preparedness and have declared that they would vote in favour of a temporary retreat, in order to wait for new tank and bomber models that should be delivered in a few months now. On the other hand, top ranking military officers consider that war is unavoidable and stress the fact that victory can be achieved now with a swift offensive against the heart of the Reich, before Germany can fully use its industrial power."

The Cabinet now wants to give priority to the Lorraine crisis and would be reportedly ready to accept this apology as long as the French military exercise is immediately cancelled, but is wary of the public opinion's reaction; the crown prince has incidentally expressed his wish to \"humble the Red murderers\" during an improvised press conference in Karlsruhe, and the Generalstab has advised against any sign of leniency that could be misunderstood by the French for a sign of weakness."

As general mobilisation has been ordered by the \"Comité de Salut Public\", our signal corps units in the West report that massive concentrations of troops, including armoured and motorised formations, have been deployed from Sedan to Montbéliard, while French fortifications near the Flemish border seem to have been significantly reinforced. At least one French plane has been shot down above German territory, and a few skirmishes have opposed our soldiers to French units near the Lorraine border. War hawks within the Cabinet and the Kaiser's entourage, encouraged by massive nationalist meetings in all major cities, is eager to rally the troops for war and finish the French off for good. However, some military circles are less than enthusiast, warning that the modern, innovative, well-trained French army is nothing like its battered 1919 counterpart and should not be underestimated."

 prewar.47.d: "아브리쿠르 사건 이후 우리의 진심어린 사과에 만족하지 못한 코뮌은 우리 국경에 대규모의 군대를 결집시키고 있으며, 아브리쿠르 폭격이 우리의 전쟁 도발이라 주장하고 있으며 프랑스측 피해자들과 파괴된 공공시설을 복구하기 위한 물질적, 금전적 보상을 요구하고 있습니다. 독일 국민들은 이러한 끝없는 근거 없는 주장에 굴복하지 않을 것입니다. 하지만 프랑스 특공대가 비록 짧은 시간일지라도 적어도 네 차례 국경을 성공적으로 넘고, 로렌의 프랑스계 준군사조직들과 접촉하면서 현지 상황이 빠르게 악화되고 있습니다. 그들에게 보상하고 코뮌과의 긴장을 완화시키는 게 현명할 지도 모릅니다."

 prewar.49.d: "Despite our goodwill gesture, Germany now claims that the so-called \"Mass murder of Elfringen\" has caused heavy material damage to the whole area and that victims have to receive monetary compensations. The German cabinet has publicly demanded that the Commune pays reparations, both in gold and in various raw materials and industrial resources, so that Elfringen and its surroundings can be rebuilt at the French people's expenses. This new claim has been met with fierce opposition from the public opinion and radical factions within both the Bourse Générale du Travail and the Army suggest that all negotiations with Germany should be terminated. But the military situation at the German border is undecided as several infantry units near Metz have suffered damage from German artillery gunfire, and our forces might be not in position to successfully engage the Kaiser's army for now..."

At 0600 local time, German artillery struck the French village of Avricourt, killing as many as 26. While the Germans insist the strike was an accident, outraged crowds have already begun to gather outside the German embassy in Paris as public opinion lurches to a war fever. Train schedules in both Germany and France have been delayed as both sides have begun deploying large formations to the border.\n\nWhile high level talks are expected to begin soon, the possibility of war still looms large.

 prewar.55.t: "An Appeal Against Escalation"
 prewar.55.d: "As tensions grow between Germany and France, it is not the nationalistic fervour of 1914 that the nations are feeling, but rather a growing dread and pessimism. Memories of the trenches loom in the minds of older citizens. To save Europe from the brink of the war, the Bund Neues Vaterland - the leading anti-war organisation in Germany - has petitioned the government to initiate peace talks with France and Britain, to at least try to avoid any conflict. The signatories of the address include prominent pacifists such as Kurt Grossman and Albert von Einstein, but also a large number of influential figures from social democratic and Christian democratic circles.\n\nEven if we do not truly believe in de-escalating the situation, it might still be useful to at least try to delay the conflict. Our military buildup has been delayed by the recent economic woes, and any amount of additional time to prepare is favourable. If we can keep the peace in the west for some more time, perhaps it will also dissuade Russia's aggressive posturing for now."

The proposed goal of the negotiations is to avoid a new war between the European great powers, or at least try to find diplomatic solutions before the whole world is once again doomed to death and destruction.\n\nThe offer might be merely playing for time, but it did gather quite bit of sympathy in parliament, and even more in the citizen organisations such as Universal Rally for Peace. The general mood is that we should at least see what they have to offer. At best, the cause of the revolution can advance further without blood being shed, and at worst, some time is lost before the inevitable confrontation will happen."

The delegations have met in [escalation_treaty_location.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], hosted by [escalation_treaty_location.country_leader.GetMonarchTitleWithSpace][escalation_treaty_location.GetLeader], and have decided to talk through the most pressing issues between the countries and seek solutions for them. Russia has sent an observer, but they denounced the negotiations themselves as a mere ploy by Germany to play for time. [copenhagen_conference_austria_present]The German delegation is led by the star of their diplomatic service, Adolf Georg von Maltzan. The French and British delegations are led by Léon Blum and Harold Nicolson, respectively. Despite radical differences between the respective governments of the participants, it does seem like the talks started out in good faith.\n\nThe most pressing issue for Germany is the Internationale's covert support to militant socialists in Germany and their allies. This was countered by Britain arguing that Germany is, if not cooperative with, then at least accepting towards the Entente powers, which are openly hostile to the Internationale. A deal was proposed, where Internationale withdraws from supporting openly violent groups in Europe, and Germany restricts their cooperation and trade with the Entente.\n\nIn addition, both sides would agree to honour the neutrality of third countries and defer from any aggression towards them. Further transfers of military forces to the Franco-German border would be stopped, and a plan for a possible de-escalation of the entire border region was set to be discussed in the future. Additionally, both Britain and Germany agreed to reduce the amount of their submarines and long-range strategic bombers, as long as the other party would do the same."

 prewar.59.d: "After days of intense debating and multiple threats by the French delegate to walk away from the negotiations, a compromise was eventually reached. The controversial agreement was received with relief across Europe, even though very few believe that it would bring lasting peace. Still, a small step towards avoiding the looming war is better than no step at all.\n\nUnsurprisingly, hawks in Germany and France have denounced the treaty. The loudest voices in the DVLP have branded the German delegation as socialist sympathisers and traitors, and more radical forces in syndicalist politics have been equally uncompromising. Nonetheless, both sides have committed to at least attempt to follow the de-escalationary measures laid out in the treaty."

Those seeking to prevent another Weltkrieg organized conference to ease the tensions between the great powers. Under Austrian meditation, both sides agreed to limit their military buildup in the Franco-German border, and limit the amount of strategic bombers and submarines that would be operational. In addition, the Internationale agreed to reduce their support to revolutionary movements in Germany, while Germany promised to reduce their cooperation with the Entente powers. Russia denounced the negotiations as German attempt to play for time, and have only increased their military buildup."
