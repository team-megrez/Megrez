 china_army_decisions_desc: "중국군은 서구 수준을 따라잡기 위해 오랫동안 노력해왔습니다. 군인들은 유명할 정도로 훈련받지 못했고, 종종 산적과 잡범 등 오만가지 이상한 자들을 징집하기도 했으며, 만성적으로 궁핍합니다. 장비는 대체로 여러 부품을 섞어서 만들었으며, 그마저도 구식이거나 완전한 폐품 수준입니다. 군인들은 충성을 국가에 바치는 게 아니라 각자 부대 지휘관이나 봉급으로 채워지는 자기 밥그릇에만 충성을 바치며, 이념적 동기는 기껏해야 오래가지도 않습니다. 이런 군대를 현대적 군대로 재건하는 데는 많은 시간이 걸릴 것입니다.\n"

The extensive autonomy we have so far enjoyed will begin chipping away and many will begin turning away from [ROOT.GetLeader] and look towards [FROM.GetLeader] for leadership.

Still, it appears things are changing.\n\nThe [FROM.GetRulingParty] operating out of [FROM.GetNameDef] have insisted on greater control over our mostly autonomous political council. They insist on control over several key internal functions, something that we had thought would be left alone when we initially agreed to submit to [FROM.GetAdjective] rule. Of course, refusing will have dire consequences, but we are quickly approaching the turning point in which it will be difficult to escape [FROM.GetLeader]'s grasp. We must now seriously contemplate the risks and successes of breaking free from the grasp of this newly proclaimed government."

Laws passed in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], previously often ignored, are now being enforced with increasing vigour. Sooner or later we will be nothing more than another province under the auspices of the [FROM.GetRulingParty]. We have no choice but to prepare our selves for war."
 china_events.10.d.integration_final: "It has been a long time coming, but all the same there was some shock within [ROOT.GetLeader]'s inner circle when [FROM.GetNameDef] made their move today.

There is really no other choice at this point, either we go down in history as good [FROM.GetRulingParty] soldiers or [ROOT.GetLeader] makes one final desperate stand against their rule.

 china_central_plains_war_desc_lkmt: "Frantic news from China has arrived that the country has seemingly fallen into another civil war. While they once proclaimed loyalty to the Kuomintang's National Government, rebellious warlords have announced their decision to cut off ties with the [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Government - denouncing the Kuomintang's apparent authoritarianism.\n\nWhile some may consider that the Kuomintang's idea of a unitary state has led to an inevitable civil war, there can be no doubt that the NRA must act quickly in dispelling the rebels, or else the Kuomintang may very well lose their chance once more to fulfil Dr. Sun's revolution."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_rkmt: "After being repeatedly ousted by his rivals, Dr. Sun Yat-sen formed the Kuomintang along vanguardist lines, demanding personal loyalty oaths from each member. Despite this, the Kuomintang have long struggled to present a united front, even before their eternal Premier's death. The Kuomintang's rightist elements have attempted to build a unified coalition, only to see it collapse in recent days.\n\nThe central government, led by [FROM.GetLeader] has denounced the growing rebellion as the work of \"bandits\" in hopes of delegitimising the growing discontent at his authoritarian rule. As the armies prepare to clash, it appears that the Kuomintang have suffered another major blow."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_zhili: "It was supposed to be over. After the Zhili clique's stunning victory over its rivals in the 1920s, many envisioned a future built along Zhili lines. This dream was utterly shattered in 1936 with the collapse of the League, and it seems things have only gotten worse from there. [FROM.GetNameDefCap]'s attempt to pick up the pieces took a severe blow today with news of a major uprising by various regional governments.\n\nReminiscent of the National Protection War, the rebels claim to be liberating the nation from Zhili tyranny. Whether or not this is merely a front for warlord rule, and if the Zhili whether yet another storm, will be determined on the battlefield."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_manchu: "Installed in an effort to achieve international legitimacy, the Qing monarchy has not been particularly popular even after the ouster of the Zhili. Their efforts to assert control over allied factions, has triggered a new National Protection War, with rebels stoking republican sentiment against what they argue is a foreign imposed monarchy.\n\nThe [FROM.GetAdjective] leadership in turn have vowed to quash the rebellion in a national pacification campaign: the outcome will determine the fate of the troubled history of the Qing dynasty."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_fengtian: "The triumph of the [FROM.GetNameDef] has not meant the end of its troubles governing over the indomitable tempers of regionalist actors. Although [FROM.GetLeader] has successfully secured the loyalty of various regional governments through negotiations, it appears those agreements fell through today as greater integration was sought.\n\nWith multiple regions now in open rebellion, [FROM.GetAdjective] legitimacy is now in question. Propaganda, true or not, about [FROM.GetAdjective] cooperation with the Japanese and other sordid rumours have begun to spread. If this rebellion is not quashed quickly, their dreams of unifying China will soon be over."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_generic: "Although [FROM.GetNameDef] has made great strides towards unification, their initial successes in securing the loyalty of various Governors has taken a major blow in recent days. Warlords are known to be mercurial and capricious in their loyalty, and the same is likely true of their [FROM.GetRulingParty] masters in [FROM.GetNameDef].\n\nThis mutual distrust combined with [FROM.GetAdjective] efforts at asserting further control has resulted in civil war breaking out as multiple previously aligned governors have denounced the central government. As the armies march to war, citizens cower and hope to survive yet another bout of instability."

We must take care to adequately adjust to such battlefield changes, and possibly expand the scope of our campaign objectives as well."
 china_united_front_desc_neutral: "Faced with foreign invasion, various Chinese factions have agreed to cooperate in a \"Chinese United Front\". Ostensibly with a unified command structure and government, experts warn that in practice regional autonomy will remain the same and coordination will probably be lacking.\n\nStill, this sudden unity against aggression has caused an outburst of patriotism in cities across the nation.

Should that happen, we can hope to rely on the foreign garrisons stationed in Shanghai and Tianjin, the volunteer corps, and some spontaneous militia units organised by civilians. With half of the police force being Chinese, questions have already been raised concerning their loyalty, along with the Chinese civilian majorities in every city within the Mandate.

 china_events.200.desc: "The great powers have maintained concessions in China since the Treaty of Nanjing, nearly a century ago. Now unified under [china.GetLeader], China itself stands on the threshold of becoming another such power. With the scales so-shifted, we have received a communique from [china.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] politely, but firmly, demanding the 'return' of our concessions.\n\nHad such a message been received mere years ago, it would have been met by little more than journalistic bemusement and jests in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] bars. Now the matter is deadly serious. The Chinese could simply walk into any of our concessions virtually unopposed, leaving us with the unenviable task of recovering them, and then subduing the Chinese nation as a whole. However, China's last century of martial tradition is spotty at best, and our own troops are no doubt the pride of [ROOT.GetNameDef]."

 china_events.340.t: "Chairman Wang Holds On"
 china_events.340.d: "Despite leading the Kuomintang from exile and near destruction to resounding national successes with the completion of the Second Northern Expedition, Chairman [CHI.GetLeader]'s rule seemed to fall apart with the growing factional opposition from the Kuomintang's Provisional Action Committee. Despite attacks on all sides however, it appears that the Chairman has indeed solidified his control and rule of the Party, effectively crushing the opposition.\n\nNow, for the first time in decades, peace has finally returned to China and Chairman Wang will seek to modernise and revive the Chinese country in order to fulfil the principles outlined by his mentor, the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, for years to come."
 china_events.340.a: "Wang Jingwei is truly the heir to Dr. Sun's Revolution."
 china_events.341.t: "Song's PAC Secures Leadership of the KMT"
 china_events.341.d: "While the Kuomintang was nominally led by Wang Jingwei during the party's exile period following the Northern Expedition, those who remained in China organised themselves as the autonomous MinGan Insurgency government. This was the foundation on which the Provisional Action Committee (PAC) of the Kuomintang was formed, and in their 1932 Declaration to the Revolutionary People in China and the World, they announced a populist, socialist platform seemingly closer to the people.\n\nYears later, Chairwoman [CHI.GetLeader] has declared the transition of the PAC into a new Revolutionary Committee to lead the common masses towards the eradication of class and towards a new revolutionary future for the peasants and workers of China."
 china_events.341.a: "The people have stood up!"
 china_events.342.t: "The Reorganisation Faction Takes Over the KMT"
 china_events.342.d: "While the Kuomintang succeeded in unifying the country under their party flag, the Party descended into civil war following the assassination and death of its former Chairman, Wang Jingwei. The party then splintered into multiple factions as the country once again collapsed into another great civil war.\n\nIt would appear that from his government in Beiping, Chairman Zeng Zhongming and Premier Chen Gongbo, along with the Reorganised Comrades Association, have proclaimed victory against all the other factions. Now that the Reorganisation Faction maintains total control of both the country and the Party, foreign observers believe that China will head towards an authoritarian socialist future, one driven by some of China's most radical socialists."

As squabbling factional forces began to fight one another, the radical China Revival Society managed to seize power and secure the country in a state of an emergency.\n\nIn a grand speech from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Generalissmo Hu Zongnan has declared that all enemies of China, both foreign and domestic, shall be crushed under a new direction of the national revolution. The CRS' talk of a totalitarian revolution inspired by the likes of Savinkov, Mussolini, and Mosley shall surely dim a light on any chances of democracy in China."

 chinese_unification_desc: "Central authority in China has long eroded, as decades of foreign imperialism, political instability and domestic unrest in light of imperial weakness spawned a new class of regional militarists in the ailing days of the old Qing Empire. The Xinhai revolution brought further turmoil to the nation, as revolutionary generals seized control of numerous provinces and set about building complex networks of military officers, allied businessmen, landed gentry, sympathetic intelligentsia, and government officials.\n\nNevertheless, a common national identity remains, and various movements across the land have made their bid to unite the nation and rebuild China in their image. Taking advantage of their own patronage networks, foreign support, and growing armies, they clash for influence in the cities and countryside. Still, in the twisting and turning realities of warlord China, open warfare is not the only this conflict develops. Tales of shifting alliances and sordid betrayal unfold, all the while foreign invasion looms..."
 china_events.401.t: "China seeks to join the Internationale"
 china_events.401.d: "Our relationship with the Chinese Kuomintang goes back to the 1924 Reorganisation of their party when we approached the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen to work with the KMT, as we see the Kuomintang movement as the only one in which a socialist China can emerge. We helped train their revolutionary army at Whampoa and most of all, we took in the Kuomintang exiles such as Wang Jingwei following the collapse of the First Northern Expedition.\n\nNow many years later, our investment in the Kuomintang has bore fruit as the Kuomintang has succeeded in unifying China under the socialist creed and has now approached us to join the Internationale. Citing their commitment to help others secure liberation in the world revolution as well as their desire to help us oversee the destruction of the German world order, they have asked to formally be invited to the Third Internationale. While we are more than happy to accept cooperation with our Chinese comrades, a minority within our  government who are suspicious of the Kuomintang's \"Party State\" ideals and have warned against working with them."

 china_events.402.d: "Our application to join the Internationale has proven to be a success! For years, we have owed much to the Third Internationale for their support, recognition, and aid in helping organise and funding the Kuomintang so that we may liberate China from the warlords and imperialists that oppressed our dear country. With our revolution finally successful, it is due time that we repay years of support to the Internationale and aid in the world revolution against the capitalist and imperialist world order of [GER.GetNameDef]. Together, the Internationale shall unite the human race and we will strive forward for mankind's socialist progress forevermore!"
 china_events.402.a: "Together we complete the world revolution!"
 china_events.403.t: "Our Application Denied."
 china_events.403.d: "Despite our desire to cooperate with the Third Internationale, unfortunately - they have denied our application to join their global revolution. Citing our ideological differences from orthodox syndicalism amongst other differences, the Internationale has formally rejected our application to join them. While this is certainly frustrating given our once close relationship with the Third Internationale, it proves to many of us that no matter what ideology - the West merely seeks to work with China for its own benefit and does not really seek to establish an equal relationship. Whether capitalist or socialist, it is quite clear to us that the West is still guided by the mindset of imperialism."
 china_events.403.a: "Imperialists can never change their stripes."
 china_events.404.t: "China seeks to join the Reichspakt"
 china_events.404.d: "Ever since we intervened in favour of the Beijing Government during the KMT's doomed Northern Expedition, we have held close ties with China both diplomatically and economically. Although at times fragile, especially during the anti-concessionist rebellion that nearly destroyed the our ally's rule over China, they have, thanks to our help, overcome this struggle and united China for good.\n\nNow, seeking deeper co-operation, the Chinese ambassador has requested for China to formally join our military alliance. While it could prove beneficial for both parties, we are aware how such closer ties could jeopardise the security of our investments as China would be pulled into any war Germany is in. However, at the same time it could give us the opportunity to better defend our interest in the event of a outside attack against China."
 china_events.404.a: "A military alliance will secure our investments."

 china_events.405.d: "Today, the [FROM.getAdjective] ambassador in Berlin has wired the German response regarding [FROM.getNameDef]'s bid to join the Reichspakt. The many years of military co-operation and economic concessions with the Germans have bore fruit - China is finally formally accepted into a military alliance with Germany.\n\nFor the government in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today marks a turning point in history. The military alliance is a major step towards the Western powers accepting China as an equal partner and thus a major step towards ending the Century of Humiliation."
 china_events.405.a: "German and Chinese soldiers march side by side."
 china_events.406.t: "Our Application Denied."
 china_events.406.d: "Despite having compromised and conceded to the Germans for years, the government in Berlin has today denied the [FROM.GetAdjective]'s request to join the Reichspakt. They cite concerns regarding the safety of German investments and preference of an ambiguous security relationship.\n\nIn response, our government has condemned Germany for its imperialist attitude towards China saying that it was a huge blow to the Chinese people and government. Still, in a separate statement they affirmed to continue strong ties to Germany despite the recent events."
