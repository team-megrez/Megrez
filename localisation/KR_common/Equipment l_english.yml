 AMA_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."

 AMA_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3.7cm 대전차포 '알레망'"
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_2: "M2 7.5cm 대전차포"
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_3: "M6 12.8cm 대전차포"
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas. While it was not used by Portuguese troops in the western front, as those were armed by Entente, chiefly British, supplies, it saw extensive use in Africa from Portugal, its allies in South Africa, and was also used by Germans who occasionally captured supplies in Portuguese East Africa."

 ANG_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "A prototype carbine that saw little widespread use in Portugal's army as a whole was the country's first attempt at a standard issue, nationally produced design. As such, the nationalist Integralist junta supported the development of the C.A.P carbine intensely, but by the time it was ready for production, realities on the ground made it more worthwhile to switch to the FBP overall directly from the older Mauser-Vergueiro and variants already widely in use by the armed forces."

While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg. While few of the models made it overseas when compared to the old Mauser-Vergueiro, the government of Angola was capable of starting production domestically relatively swiftly after decolonisation."

 ANG_support_weapons_4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors.

 ANG_infantry_at: "모르테이루-봄바르다"
 ANG_infantry_at_desc: "Developed in Canada and sold in substantial amounts to Portugal, the mortar design was that of a 'spigot' mortar.

However, experience in jungle warfare brought to attention new needs for the service rifle, specifically in weight, length, and handling. Lithgow thus developed the \"Jungle carbine\" (a commercial name from the post-war), featuring a 18.75 inches (476mm) barrel compared to 25.2 inches (640mm) of the Mk III and V."

Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."

However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Bahian army until the 1960s."

 BAH_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."

The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3.7cm 대전차포 '알레망'"
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_2: "M2 7.5cm 대전차포"
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."

 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."

The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."

However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."

The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."

The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'.

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

 BAY_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."

 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7.5cm Pa.K. 40"
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."

 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12.8cm Pa.K. 43"
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 BAY_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."

 BAY_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3.7cm Fla.K. 37"
 BAY_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."

 BAY_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."

Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday.

While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."

 CAN_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Initially adopted in 1903, the Ross rifle saw several upgrades before the Great War, culminating in the Mk III in 1910. Initially a symbol of patriotism among Canadians as the British refused to license the Lee-Enfield to them, the rifle received an abysmal reputation within the first year of the war, unable to handle the lower quality of British-made ammunition and significantly worse with trench conditions than its contemporaries, and was officially pulled out of service in 1916. Nevertheless, the SMLE was never produced in Canada before the British Revolution, prompting its unwanted return to service as a stopgap until production of the SMLE could begin at Long Branch, Ontario."

Some British engineers from Enfield took refuge in Ontario. With the help of the Lithgow factory in Australia, they continued their work on upgrading the venerable SMLE, resulting in the Mk V. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the receiver instead of the middle, improving sighting radius, accuracy, and speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."

The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The \"Owen\" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."

The Chilean Mauser 1895 has earned a reputation for reliability under even the harshest conditions, one which it maintains decades after its adoption."

 CHL_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Shortly before the Weltkrieg, Chile contracted the Austrian arms manufacturer Steyr for a new Carbine variant of the German Mauser 1898 chambered in 7x57mm like older Chilean rifles. Many of these carbines eventually fell into the hands of the Chilean Carabinieros, who found the rifle unsatisfactory and lobbied for its replacement. In 1935, a new pattern with improved ergonomics and a new larger magazine with more robust feed lips and loader was approved and entered into production shortly thereafter."

The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."

The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."

Considered to be on par with the rest of the rifles in Europe, the gun has a length of 133 cm, making it dangerous in the hands of a marksman. However, the gun's length sacrifices its mobility, and it can be pretty heavy and less manageable in close-range fighting. Thus, some variants of the weapon were modified into carbines for shorter engagements."

With the desire for greater firepower for Danish squads, the M/31 was made from stainless steel with a tubular buttstock and a distinctive ball-shaped wooden foregrip. The foregrip was designed with ergonomic flexibility for the user when handling the weapon.

In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.In 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, and a simplified bolt system.\" The No.4 is the newest member in the family of Lee-Enfield rifles. While similar to its predecessors, the No.4 is stronger and easier to produce.

The KP/-41 itself began as a derivative of Lahti's own 'Suomi' submachine gun rechambered for his new cartridge, and indeed, while retention of the general shape and feel of the KP/-31 was preferred, ultimately, the new design's massive recoil impetus led to both further external changes to the weapon's body as well as a reduction in its cyclic rate."

 FOP_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Shortly before the Weltkrieg, Chile contracted the Austrian arms manufacturer Steyr for a new Carbine variant of the German Mauser 1898 chambered in 7x57mm like older Chilean rifles. Many of these carbines eventually fell into the hands of the Chilean Carabinieros, who found the rifle unsatisfactory and lobbied for its replacement. In 1935, a new pattern with improved ergonomics and a new larger magazine with more robust feed lips and loader was approved and entered into production shortly thereafter. A few months after its initial production, the rifles began to trickle into Patagonia."

 GBR_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Initially adopted in 1903, the Ross rifle saw several upgrades before the Great War, culminating in the Mk III in 1910. Initially a symbol of patriotism among Canadians as the British refused to license the Lee-Enfield to them, the rifle received an abysmal reputation within the first year of the war, unable to handle the lower quality of British-made ammunition and significantly worse with trench conditions than its contemporaries, and was officially pulled out of service in 1916. Nevertheless, the SMLE was never produced in Canada before the British Revolution, prompting its unwanted return to service as a stopgap until production of the SMLE could begin at Long Branch, Ontario."

 GBR_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the loyal Dominions only had access to one arsenal capable of producing its service rifle. Some British engineers from Enfield took refuge in Ontario. With the help of the Lithgow factory in Australia, they continued their work on upgrading the venerable SMLE, resulting in the Mk V. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the receiver instead of the middle, improving sighting radius, accuracy, and speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."

 GBR_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The \"Owen\" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."

The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat."

The De Lisle carbine is, essentially, a shortened SMLE converted to .45 ACP, a subsonic cartridge with an integrated suppressor. The suppressor and ammunition together produced as little as 85.5 decibels when firing, making it very suitable for commando operations."

 GER_infantry_equipment_0_short: "마우저 G. 98"
 GER_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Gewehr 98 (Rifle 98) was the standard German infantry weapon of the Weltkrieg. It is a good example of the type of military rifle designed around the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when rifle development reached fever pitch. In common with other armies, the German infantry carried a full length rifle, while other troops were issued with shorter carbines. The bolt and magazine system of the Gewehr 98 was designed by the Mauser company, although the rifle was produced under licence by a number of other commercial manufacturers. It was a well-made and accurate weapon, but was not well suited to trench warfare."
 GER_infantry_equipment_1: "98년형 기병총 B형"
 GER_infantry_equipment_1_short: "마우저 Kar. 98b"
 GER_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs."

 GER_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by the Mauser company in response to a desire of the German Army for a self-loading rifle with a backup bolt action, the Selbstladegewehr 40 is a massive leap forward in German small arms design. While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the Heer eventually dropped some of its other specific requirements for the rifle. The end result was the initial prototype with only a few design edits, and it proved effective."

 GER_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Maschinenkarabiner 42 is a revolutionary design chambered for a new intermediate cartridge, developed by famous German arms designer Hugo Schmeisser, in conjunction with the Haenel company. While the first prototype of the rifle was prone to jamming, both the military and even the Kaiser himself were extremely enthusiastic about the project, and immense resources were concentrated on improving the design, with the rifle deemed ready for adoption in 1942."

 GER_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "The M.P. 40, sometimes incorrectly called 'Schmeisser', was developed by Heinrich Vollmer and based on M.P. 38, with the aim of equipping German soldiers with an assault weapon. It uses magazines of 32 cartridges of 9mm, with its effective range being about 100-150 metres. It is a very reliable and particularly economical weapon to manufacture, usually used by officers, mechanised infantry and paratroopers."

 GER_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Maschinenkarabiner 44 is the outcome of the German need to provide infantrymen with heavier firepower from their rifles. As a result of the continuous development of M.Kb. 42, the M.Kb. 44 is devoid of many of the disadvantages of the previous design and is even sometimes called the 'Sturmgewehr' - the assault rifle. The final design has a shorter range than contemporary rifles due to German research that most of the combat in the European War takes place at distances less than 300 metres. At the sacrifice of range, close range firepower was greatly improved."

 GER_motorized_equipment_1_desc: "The German Army in the early 1930s had more than 100 different vehicle designs in service, leading to massive logistical difficulties. In order to standardise their vehicle fleet, they opted for a commercial truck design by Adam Opel AG of Brandenburg to become their standard cargo truck. With only slight modifications to meet military requirements, presented in 1930, the Opel Blitz was accepted in service with designation Kraftfahrzeug 305 and by 1936 became the main truck of the German Army. Although well built, the Kfz.305 suffers from being rather too complicated for reliability in the rugged conditions, but still has better performance than other German trucks."

Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen “Kätzchen” (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour. Warmly met by the German Military despite not very high speed, the vehicle was adopted in service under the name Sd.Kfz. 256."

Ordered in 1935 for use by German Army engineers, the Landwasserschlepper (Land Water Tractor) was intended as a lightweight river tug with some capacity to operate on land. Designed by Borsig of Düsseldorf, the hull of the L.W.S. is similar to that of a motor launch, resembling a tracked boat with twin rear-mounted tunnelled propellers and twin rudders. On land, it moves on steel-shod tracks with four bogies per side."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."

However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."

The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."

The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."

 GRU_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."

 GRU_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15cm s.F.H. 36"
 GRU_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

 GRU_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 GRU_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3.7cm Pa.K. 36"
 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_2: "40년형 7.5cm 대전차포"
 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7.5cm Pa.K. 40"
 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_3: "43년형 12.8cm 대전차포"
 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12.8cm Pa.K. 43"
 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_1: "36년형 2cm 대공포"

 GRU_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_2: "37년형 3.7cm 대공포"
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3.7cm Fla.K. 37"
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_3: "41년형 8.8cm 대공포"
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8.8cm Fla.K. 41"
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."

 GOY_infantry_at_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however. Heavier variants were assigned to Anti Tank duties in the lack of proper weapons for the task in the armed forces."

These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."

Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."

 GOY_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Goiano army until the 1960s."

 GOY_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."

 GOY_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."

 GOY_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3.7cm 대전차포 '알레망'"
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_2: "M2 7.5cm 대전차포"
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."

 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials.

The MAB-38 can be recognised by its machined steel receiver, fine craftsmanship, and perforated cooling jacket over the barrel. The gun fires 9x19mm Parabellum at 600 rounds per minute, making it a deadly weapon in close quarters and urban combat. Interestingly enough, the gun features two triggers for two firing modes; the fore trigger is for semi-automatic fire while the rear trigger is for fully automatic."

The FNAB-42 uses a delayed-blowback system that fires from a closed bolt position - this allows the rate of fire to be kept at a steady 400 rpm without having to use a heavy bolt and strong spring. The complexity of this weapon reflects the latest sophistication of Italian ingenuity."

 ITA_support_weapons2_desc: "The Breda M30 is an unusual weapon. It is fed from a fixed magazine attached to its side and is loaded with steel 20 round stripper clips. The firing rate and low magazine capacity makes the weapon more ideal as a semi-automatic rifle instead of a light machine gun. The Mortaio 81 is a lightweight Brandt-style mortar that has seen great feedback in the testing ranges due to its range capacity and reliability. The mortar uses two shells; one heavy high-explosive shell and another lighter shell for long-distance fire."

The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The \"Owen\" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments.

 JAP_infantry_equipment_0: "아리사카 38식"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_0_short: "38식"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1905, the '38th year 'of the Meiji Period (hence its name); the Type 38 uses the 6.5x50mm Arisaka cartridges. This cartridge produces little recoil when fired. The Type 38 at 128 cm is a long rifle due to the emphasis on bayonet training for Japanese soldiers of this era."
 JAP_infantry_equipment_1: "아리사카 99식"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_1_short: "99식"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Type 99 is intended to serve as a replacement for the Type 38. The Imperial Army recognised the weaknesses of the Type 38 and pushed for the Type 99 to serve as its replacement. The Type 99 was produced in four versions: the regular issue rifle, the 'long' rifle, a paratroop rifle, and a sniper variant."
 JAP_infantry_equipment_2: "가와무라 14식"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_2_short: "14식"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "In 1931, the Japanese Army approached Kijiro Nambu to design a new semi-automatic rifle. His design, based on the Pedersen Rifle, which had been unsuccessfully presented to Japan years earlier, ultimately led nowhere due both to difficulties with the Pedersen delayed-blowback toggle-lock system and the unrealistic goals of the Army. However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later. The design of Masaya Kawamura, of the Nippon Special Steel Company, would ultimately be chosen and adopted by Japan as the Type 14 due to its reliability and ability to function without the need for wax-lubricated cartridges."
 JAP_infantry_equipment_3: "요코스카 4식"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_3_short: "4식"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "Japan has long relied on bolt action rifles, and their age is beginning to show. Thus, with the Type 14, the Imperial Army at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal has designed the Type 4 semi-automatic rifle. Charged with two 5-round stripper clips, Type 4 comes in two variants: the navy and the other for the army. The development of this weapon would give the Japanese infantryman significantly more firepower on the battlefield than previous weapons."
 JAP_infantry_at: "97식 자동포"
 JAP_infantry_at_desc: "Given the fact that German tanks exist in China as well as the ever-present threat of the Russian bear on the borders, Type 97 was designed to combat armoured vehicles. The gun is a monstrosity of a weapon; it has an overall length of 2.09 metres and weighs 52 kilograms (115 pounds). Capable of penetrating 30mm of armour at a range of 250 metres; it is truly a fearsome weapon in the right hands."
 JAP_infantry_at2: "4식 70mm 분진포"
 JAP_infantry_at2_desc: "The rocket launcher was made in two parts that are to be joined in the middle. Intended to be fired while lying down prone; the Type 4 rocket launcher uses a bipod and a mortar fuze. Interestingly enough, the Type 4 rocket uses angled venturis in the base to spin the rocket for stability."
 JAP_support_weapons: "3년식 중기관총 & 11년식 곡사보병포"
 JAP_support_weapons_desc: "The Type 3 Heavy Machine Gun was based on the design of the French Hotchkiss M1914. The Type 3 uses an ammo strip for loading rounds, and its tripod could be used for anti-aircraft mounting. The Type 11 mortar was developed in the 11th year of the Taisho Emperor. Exceptional amongst Japanese weapons; Type 11 is a muzzle-loaded weapon with a rifled bore."
 JAP_support_weapons2: "11년식 경기관총 & 10년식 척탄통"
 JAP_support_weapons2_desc: "Combat experience in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 taught the Imperial Army the utility of machine guns providing covering fire. The Type 11 was developed by the famed arms designer Kijiro Nambu based on a French Hotchkiss M1909 and is air-cooled and gas-operated. A unique feature about the Type 11 machine gun is its detachable hopper; it can be refilled while attached and does not require removal during operation. The Type 10 grenade discharger was a smoothbore muzzle-loaded weapon with an incredible range of 175 metres."
 JAP_support_weapons3: "99식 경기관총 & 94식 경박격포"
 JAP_support_weapons3_desc: "The Type 99 LMG uses the new rounds found in the Arisaka Type 99. Retaining the same design as previous light machine guns and bears a resemblance to the English Enfield-Automatic. The Type 99 also allows for the attachment of a standard-issue bayonet and 2.5x telescopic sight for marksmanship. The Type 94 mortar is a heavy mortar that has a range of 4000 yards. It is intended to serve as an artillery piece that could be hauled in pieces to remote areas."
 JAP_support_weapons4: "1식 중기관총 & 2식 12cm 박격포"
 JAP_support_weapons4_desc: "The Type 1 is a meatgrinder of a weapon. This gas operated heavy machine gun can also be fielded as an anti-aircraft weapon. The Type 2 mortar is virtually identical to the Stokes-Brandt 81mm mortar with the only difference being that the bipod legs of the Type 2 can be removed."
 JAP_infantry_weapons2: "2형 기관단총"
 JAP_infantry_weapons2_desc: "Designed by famed arms designer Kijiro Nambu, the Model 2 is a blowback-operated submachine gun. One of Japan's first attempts at a submachine gun, the Model 2 features an incredible high rate of fire while also being light and portable. A pnuematic buffer device cushions the action of the gun and acts as a bolt delay."
 JAP_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "100식"
 JAP_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Type 100 is Japan's first mass-produced submachine gun. Although there are variants with bipods and increased sights for cavalry units, it is designed for infantry use. The gun fires 8mm at 450 rounds per minute. Interestingly some variants have been converted to folding stocks for use by army paratroopers."
 JAP_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "100/44식"
 JAP_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "This 1944 modification of Type 100 includes several changes designed to simplify the weapon. The 1944 variant is longer than the earlier Type 100 with simple iron sights and a greatly simplified muzzle. The firing rate of the 1944 version is also considerably higher, with the gun firing at 800 rounds per minute. The gun is an absolute monster at close ranges with satisfactory accuracy and low recoil."

Although the No.1 Mk III* saw use in the Legation Cities well before the Weltkrieg in the hands of the old British garrison, the revolution in 1926 and the retreat of the China Station to Australasia in the same year saw the rifle continue service with police forces across the Legation Cities, as well as with the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.\n\nAs most of these rifles were Weltkrieg-era surplus, and many have long been without proper maintenance or replaceable parts, attrition has taken its toll. Now that there may be too few rifles to furnish an expanded police force, some have come to regard the Lee-Enfield as necessarily obsolete."

 LEC_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Mauser 98b is the cutting edge of German bolt-action rifle technology. With an easier to operate bolt, superior ironsights, an improved stock, and a lighter build, this weapon is a substantial improvement over its predecessors. The 98b is also especially practical in China, as the most common rifle beyond the Neutral Zone is the Hanyang 88, a copy of the older Mauser 1888, with which it shares ammunition."

The top of the carriage is equipped with a machine gun or infantry support gun, with several shooting holes at the rear. The compartment of the armoured vehicle has skylights, allowing the crews to reach out of the compartment, in order to suppress a crowd with strong light or high-pressure water guns. The huge carriage of the armoured vehicle made it look like a prison vehicle, so people gave this unnamed riot control vehicle a derogatory nickname: 'Feixing Baolei' or 'Flying Fortress'.

While the Krags proved superior at close ranges to comparable Mauser designs in the Spanish-American war, the rifle's flimsy action in comparison to newer bolt designs necessitated a replacement a mere decade after its adoption. Liberia acquired its Krags as highly discounted military assistance from the United States shortly after the fall of France in Europe, thanks largely to American fears of Nationalist French invasion of the country."

 LIT_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Germany's eastern allies all had large stocks of Russian Mosin rifles, but they all adopted the 8mm Mauser cartridge to match German standards.

 LIT_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs. Many models were ordered by Lithuanian government."

Unable to secure the German Army's standard MP-40, the Oststaaten often have to make due with what is commercially available through private firms. The MP-35, designed by Emil Bergmann and notable for its horizontal magazine on the right side, is a popular choice thanks to its relative ruggedness and affordability, along with Bergmann's willingness to license the design."

Under ideal conditions, the R.Pz.B. 54 can penetrate heavy tanks' armour with its 8,8-centimetre rockets, already used by the Raketenwerfer 43 rocket launchers. As a drawback, the R.Pz.B. 54 produces a lot of smoke upon firing. Many shipped over from Germany given Lithuania's lack of anti tank weapons."

Initially intended to be a prime mover, the Sd.Kfz. 11 soon was transferred to the role of a transporter, when the need for an all-terrain vehicle became apparent. Capable of carrying eight soldiers in addition to towing a gun or a trailer, the truck became the main vehicle of panzergrenadiers."

Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen 'Kätzchen' (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour. Warmly met by the German Military despite not very high speed, the vehicle was adopted in service under the name Sd.Kfz. 256."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."

 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."

 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 MAF_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."

 MAF_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3.7cm Fla.K. 37"
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."

 MAF_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg.

Arguing that the design could serve as both an artillery piece and an anti-tank weapon, the design was eagerly adopted by several allies of the Entente, including Portugal. Many ended up stranded in its former overseas possessions."

 MZB_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the LATI (A direct translation of its Canadian English name) was developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device was well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there were concerns about its intense recoil."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."

However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed.

The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."

 NZL_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1: "SMLE Mk V"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 NZL_infantry_equipment_2: "오웬 Mk 1"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_2_short: "오웬 자동기병총"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The \"Owen\" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."

 NZL_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming."

A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 NZL_infantry_weapons2: "BSA 톰슨 M1926"
 NZL_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 NZL_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "란체스터 기관단총"
 NZL_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 NZL_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "커네이디언 자동기병총 Mk 1"
 NZL_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."

 NZL_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."

 NZL_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."

 NZL_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors.

The rifle was gradually adopted along with the .30-06 cartridge both before and while the rest of the world waged the Weltkrieg. Rifles trickled into the hands of Pro-American regimes which controlled Panama until 1924. Panamanian Mausers were rechambered in 7.65×53mm to compliment Panama's Peruvian Mausers."

 PAP_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Following the rejection of its 1938 pattern semi-automatic rifle, the CZ company attempted to market the design to a variety of foreign nations. The Two Sicilies tested the rifle and like the Austrians, found the rifle unreliable in harsh conditions and difficult to disassemble, but sought to redesign the gun to fix its shortcomings. The SME state run electrical company, which had begun to produce and design small arms only a few years prior, was set to the task. The end result, designated the SME M38 upon adoption, while improved over its Czech predecessor, still bears many of the latter's design quirks."

 PAP_train_equipment_1_desc: "Designed by the Adriatic Railways shortly before the nationalisation of the railways in 1905, the 740 Group is a series of 'Consolidation' class locomotives. Built to haul heavy trains on the mountainous lines of the Northern Appennine, while keeping a comparatively low axle load of 14 tons to run on older, less frequently mantained tracks, these engines excelled in their task, and were subsequently built in copious number before the Great War. Distributed across the Peninsula to relieve the older pre-nationalisation engines, a good number of those engines ended up in service around Rome, and subsequently remained in our hands."

While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."

It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas. While it was not used by Portuguese troops in the western front, as those were armed by Entente, chiefly British, supplies, it saw extensive use in Africa from Portugal, its allies in South Africa, and was also used by Germans who occasionally captured supplies in Portuguese East Africa."

While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg."

While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."

 SAF_infantry_equipment_0_short: "SMLE Mk III"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 SAF_infantry_equipment_1: "SMLE Mk V"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 SAF_infantry_equipment_2: "오웬 Mk 1"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_2_short: "오웬 자동기병총"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The \"Owen\" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 SAF_infantry_equipment_3: "롱 브랜치 Mk 1"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk 1"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming."
 SAF_night_vision: "Receivers, Tabby, Periscope Mk 1"
 SAF_night_vision_short: "태비 투시경"
 SAF_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 SAF_infantry_weapons2: "BSA 톰슨 M1926"
 SAF_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 SAF_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "란체스터 기관단총"
 SAF_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 SAF_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "커네이디언 자동기병총 Mk 1"
 SAF_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 SAF_infantry_at: "No. 68 대전차총류탄"
 SAF_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 SAF_infantry_at2: "보병용 대전차발사기 Mk I"
 SAF_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."

 SAF_support_weapons2: "루이스 Mk III DEMS & SBML 2인치 박격포"
 SAF_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 SAF_support_weapons3: "비커스 M Mk II & ML 3인치 박격포"
 SAF_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 SAF_support_weapons4: "비커스 M Mk III & ML 4.2인치 박격포"
 SAF_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."

Trials for an entirely new rifle were finally held in 1932, but would largely fail to bare fruit, with new designs unable to match the old Enfield or receiving unfavourable troop evaluations. In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.\n\nIn 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, aperture sights, and a simplified bolt system."

Therefore, in March 1932, he ordered the engineer Jiang Shouting to go to Tianjin to negotiate with the representatives from the American Federal Motor Truck Company. The Americans eventually agreed to transfer the 1.5 ton truck technology to Shanxi, and Jiang Shouting used this as a basis to create the reliable and durable Type Shanxi by the end of the same year."

The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs.

 SIC_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by the Mauser company in response to a desire of the German Army for a self-loading rifle with a backup bolt action, the Selbstladegewehr 40 is a massive leap forward in German small arms design. While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the German Heer eventually dropped some of its other specific requirements for the rifle. The end result was the initial prototype with only a few design edits, and it proved effective. As a response to growing tensions on the Italian peninsula, large numbers of these rifles were sent to the Sicilian Armed Forces."

 SIC_train_equipment_1_desc: "Designed by the Adriatic Railways shortly before the nationalisation of the railways in 1905, the 740 Group is a series of 'Consolidation' class locomotives. Built to haul heavy trains on the mountainous lines of the Northern Appennine, while keeping a comparatively low axle load of 14 tons to run on older, less frequently mantained tracks, these engines excelled in their task, and were subsequently built in copious number before the Great War. Distributed across the Peninsula to relieve the older pre-nationalisation engines, a good number of those engines ended up in service in Sicily, and subsequently remained in our hands."

Seeing that these trucks can drive continuously in harsh environments, during the expedition's stay in Xinjiang, Yang Zengxin proposed to purchase a batch of Citroën P21 cars, and the expedition readily agreed to this request because the purpose of their expedition was to advertise for Citroën. Soon after the expedition arrived in Beijing in February 1932, the French shipped the first batch of auto parts and engineers to Xinjiang. This truck has also become the most common truck in Xinjiang."

The magazine system uses en bloc charger clips which were originally developed by Ferdinand Mannlicher - hence why the gun is often referred to as the 'Mannlicher-Carcano', but in Somalia its also known as simply the 'Karcan', and large amounts of the gun were in use by native Askari and colonial troops alike during their disorganized withdrawl at the tail end of the Weltkrieg, wherein much material was left behind."

Many of these weapons were sold to Somalia, as the state had a difficult time establishing a local manufacturing plant for weapons.

These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."

 SPO_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."

 SPO_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Gaucho army until the 1960s."

 SPO_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."

 SPO_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3.7cm 대전차포 '알레망'"
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."

 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."

 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

More powerful than their predecessors and cheaper to operate, the higher axle load is not a problem on these relatively small engines, allowing them to operate in all but the least mantained lines. However, they remain less powerful than other locomotives, requiring multiple engines to haul the heaviest trains."

In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."

However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."

 RHI_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."

 RHI_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

Wanting to make cost-effective use of existing stocks until more Mauser rifles were available, Polish arsenals worked to convert Mosin rifles into carbines chambering the new official cartridge.

 WHR_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs. Many models were ordered by Belarusian government."

Unable to secure the German Army's standard MP-40, the Oststaaten often have to make due with what is commercially available through private firms. The MP-35, designed by Emil Bergmann and notable for its horizontal magazine on the right side, is a popular choice thanks to its relative ruggedness and affordability, along with Bergmann's willingness to license the design."

The design is very simple and easy to produce, mechanically an enlarged pistol made from extensive use of stamped sheetmetal, using the same intermediate cartridge and 30-round magazines. This semi-automatic rifle, while failing to impress the German Army, caught the interest of Oststaaten, especially Belarus, looking for a cheap alternative to the M.Kb. 42, as the Germans were unwilling to share them. Waffenfabrik Suhl is happy to produce and license the design for local production, significantly raising the firepower of the otherwise-light infantry of Germany's eastern allies."

Under ideal conditions, the R.Pz.B. 54 can penetrate heavy tanks’ armour with its 8,8-centimetre rockets, already used by the Raketenwerfer 43 rocket launchers. As a drawback, the R.Pz.B. 54 produces a lot of smoke upon firing. Many shipped over from Germany given Belarus' lack of anti tank weapons."

The Matériel de 75mm Contre-Aérien Modèle 1940 by Schneider has faster rate of fire, higher muzzle velocity, increased vertical range, modern fire control and greater mobility with new gun carriages, than the old Soixante-Quinze. Impressed by the performance of the former Mitrailleuse 37mm CA from Schneider, the French command quickly adopted the new 75mm gun."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."

 PRE_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."

However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."

 PRE_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."

The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

 IMP_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Initially adopted in 1903, the Ross rifle saw several upgrades before the Great War, culminating in the Mk III in 1910. Initially a symbol of patriotism among Canadians as the British refused to license the Lee-Enfield to them, the rifle received an abysmal reputation within the first year of the war, unable to handle the lower quality of British-made ammunition and significantly worse with trench conditions than its contemporaries, and was officially pulled out of service in 1916. Nevertheless, the SMLE was never produced in Canada before the British Revolution, prompting its unwanted return to service as a stopgap until production of the SMLE could begin at Long Branch, Ontario."

 IMP_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the loyal Dominions only had access to one arsenal capable of producing its service rifle. Some British engineers from Enfield took refuge in Ontario. With the help of the Lithgow factory in Australia, they continued their work on upgrading the venerable SMLE, resulting in the Mk V. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the receiver instead of the middle, improving sighting radius, accuracy, and speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."

The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The \"Owen\" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments.

 IMP_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "With the success of the Rover under its belt, the Ruskin Motor Bodies company designed the Rhino in response to an Australasian government request for a substantially heavier armoured car built upon the CMP chassis. Though substantial changes were made to that CMP chassis, after much work the Rhino was born, and with substantial interchangeability of parts with other CMP-based designs to boot."

The 'Hippo' as this model has been designated, proved to be quite the headache for its design team, as these changes caused the already heavy vehicle to run into weight issues like its predecessors which had to be slowly worked out prior to the vehicle's adoption."

 GYA_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."

 GYA_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."

 GYA_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The \"Owen\" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."

The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming."

Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 GYA_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 GYA_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 GYA_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "란체스터 기관단총"
 GYA_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 GYA_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 GYA_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 GYA_infantry_at: "No. 68 대전차총류탄"
 GYA_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 GYA_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 GYA_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."

 GYA_support_weapons2: "루이스 Mk III DEMS & SBML 2인치 박격포"
 GYA_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 GYA_support_weapons3: "비커스 M Mk II & ML 3인치 박격포"
 GYA_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 GYA_support_weapons4: "비커스 M Mk III & ML 4.2인치 박격포"
 GYA_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."

 HUN_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by Pál Király, this \"heavy\" submachine gun used specially-loaded 9x25mm ammunition in a folding magazine for transport and storage. This made it very potent and reliable compared to its contemporaries, making it reminiscent of later assault rifle designs."
 HUN_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As it became clear that engagement distances had significantly shortened since the Weltkrieg, the Monarchy became interested in developing an intermediate cartridge and the \"machine-carbine\" idea. The Koucký brothers at Zbrojovka Brno presented their ZK 412 design using the 8x35mm \"Rapid\" cartridge with similar performance to the German 8x33mm Kurz."

Using the latter's widely-available ammunition, the Najman Hand Mortar could cause heavy damage in hit-and-run attacks, allowing the attackers to retreat quickly and saving lives as the weapon did not require to be deployed."
 JAP_train_equipment_1_desc: "While the Class D50 was well liked, the financial situation of the early 1930s led to no new freight locomotive designs until 1936. The latest freight locomotive design, the Class D51 had numerous improvements, from the use of welding, implementing a higher pressure boiler, revised cylinders, reduced axle load and overall shortening the locomotive, it proved a great step up from its predecessor."
 JAP_train_equipment_2_desc: "Based on the D51 design, the D52 incorporated numerous austerity modifications to improve the performance of the locomotive and reduce the cost of production. The design has a larger boiler and grate area, leading to higher tractive effort, while austerity considerations allow for replacing the running board with wood and looser production standards for most components."
