### Parties ###
 RUS_totalist_party: "KNOF"
 RUS_totalist_party_long: "Kommunisticheskiy Narodno-Osvoboditelniy Front (Communist People's Liberation Front)\n§gThe KNOF is an underground organisation founded by revolutionary extremist Karl Radek in the late 1920s that publishes propaganda about a Second Russian Revolution. Believing that Russia is the capitalist nation most vulnerable to a socialist revolt, Radek waits for a national catastrophe that will enable him to organise the workers into militias against the corrupt White establishment. Seeing itself as the vanguard of Russian socialism, the KNOF advocates rapid industrialisation under the auspices of five-year plans to quickly transition Russia into a proper socialist state. To that end, Radek seeks to control the labour unions and militarise their workers into labour armies that will diligently follow the will of the state.§!"
 RUS_syndicalist_party: "PSP"
 RUS_syndicalist_party_long: "Profsoyuznaya Sotsialisticheskaya Partiya (Trade Union Socialist Party)\n§gThe PSP is an urban-centred socialist party founded by former RSFSR Central Committee member Aleksandra Kollontai and her lover, fellow revolutionary Aleksandr Shlyapnikov. Although the PSP is a legal party, its supporters' rights have long been curtailed by the aristocracy, and they believe that the system must be overthrown. They hope that someday, the government will be weakened by a national catastrophe, letting them seize major cities such as Moscow to spearhead a revolution. True to its support base, the PSP believes that Russia must be managed by trade unions, seeing them as the most representative of the needs of the urban workers, themselves seen as the will of the proletariat. Due to this stance, the PSP is the Russian political party closest to orthodox French syndicalism, a fact conveniently utilised by its detractors to portray Kollontai, Shlyapnikov and the unions they represent as Communard-sponsored agitators.§!"
 RUS_radical_socialist_party: "NSP"
 RUS_radical_socialist_party_long: "Narodnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Partiya (People's Socialist Party)\n§gThe NSP is a socialist party founded by Old Bolsheviks Nikolai Bukharin and Aleksey Rykov, who sought to reorganise the Bolshevik remnants into a new political party to regain power in Russia. Knowing that they have little chance of peacefully gaining power due to the military, Bukharin and Rykov hope that the ongoing political crisis will culminate in the generals dismantling their sham democracy and starting a wave of repression, enabling the NSP to launch another revolution in the name of popular freedom. An opponent of bureaucratisation, the NSP asserts that Russia must industrialise slowly to prevent the creation of a massive state bureaucracy that could curtail the power of the proletariat. The party also seeks the amendment of the divide between urban workers and rural peasants, so that they can unite against the reactionary aristocracy and military.§!"
 RUS_social_democrat_party: "RSDRP"
 RUS_social_democrat_party_long: "Rossiyskaya Sotsial-Demokraticheskaya Rabochaya Partiya (Russian Social Democratic Labour Party)\n§gThe RSDRP, a familiar sight to all Russians who lived through 1917, has undergone great change since its foundation in 1898. Originally encompassing both radical Bolsheviks and more moderate Mensheviks, the RSDRP split after the failure of the October Revolution forced each faction to adapt to the new situation differently. The Bolsheviks either fled to the newly-estabilished Commune of France and Union of Britain, went underground in the hopes that figures like Nikolai Bukharin would bring forth a Second Revolution, or reformed into democratic socialist parties deemed more acceptable by the victorious Whites. The Mensheviks, on the other hand, fled to Georgia, but a group of internationalists, disillusioned with the Georgian wing's growing nationalism, returned to Russia and took on the mantle of the RSDRP by themselves. Under Irakliy Tseredeli's leadership, they have returned to prominence in politics, becoming the leading opposition party.§!"

 RUS_Invite_Baltics_desc: "The Baltic states were once part of the Empire, but perhaps it would be more pragmatic to offer them an alliance, rather than fritter away resources conquering and pacifying them. We would do well to align them to our aims, if even just to prevent others from doing so."
 RUS_Invite_Finland_desc: "Finland broke away from the Empire, and took with it the strategically valuable area of Karelia. But perhaps instead of demanding the region from them, we could see if they might seek common cause with us? Even if they say no, there is always the alternative..."

The army is the only obstacle on the path leading to chaos and disintegration of Russia, they shall take up the education of our youth and soon the education of the whole country. A military spirit can only benefit the Motherland."

 RUS_State_Revanchism: "State Revanchism"
 RUS_State_Revanchism_desc: "Now that Russia has stabilised and grown stronger under the rule of her army she must now grow, we must reclaim the land that has been stolen to us and liberate their peoples that are chanting for our return!"

 RUS_Establish_The_VES: "Establish the VES"
 RUS_Establish_The_VES_desc: "Now that Savinkov is in power, we can finally enact much needed economic reform to this countries neglected industrial base. We shall create a Supreme Economic Council. The VES (Verkhovny Ekonomicheskiy Sovet) shall take control of the industrial development of this nation and bring it up to western standards."

 RUS_Ural_Tractor_Plants: "Ural Tractor Plants"
 RUS_Ural_Tractor_Plants_desc: "If there's one thing that Russia does not lack, it is land. We shall set up state sponsored factories and steelworks deep within the heart of our nation to produce mechanised vehicles, far beyond the reach of Europe."

 RUS_Machine_And_Tractor_Stations: "Machine and Tractor Stations"
 RUS_Machine_And_Tractor_Stations_desc: "The land redistribution promised by Savinkov allowed us to fund many farms in the Central Russia. The next step is to provide our peasants with agricultural machinery. That's why we should establish machine and tractor stations (MTS), to be rural agencies that will supply farms with agricultural machinery and people to run it. Such cooperation will revive the agricultural sector in Russia."

 RUS_Railway_Nationalisation: "Railway Nationalisation"
 RUS_Railway_Nationalisation_desc: "Railways are the lifeblood of our vast nation, yet under the Tsar and later the Republic they have been sorely neglected. We shall nationalise all commercially owned railroads as well as enact government funded schemes to construct new lines to our cities and industrial complexes."

 RUS_Korporatsiya_Yusupova: "Korporatsiya Yusupova"
 RUS_Korporatsiya_Yusupova_desc: "\"Korporatsiya Yusupova\" (Yusupov's Corporation), a united civil and military engineering organisation, has launched several industrial projects, which will reduce our dependence on German goods, provide our army with new arms and help us bring down unemployment. It is however necessary to provide his corporation with the legal privileges to compete with foreign factories."

 RUS_Industrial_Draft_Scheme: "Industrial Draft Scheme"
 RUS_Industrial_Draft_Scheme_desc: "Although we have made great strides in improving the industrial capabilities of our nation, there is still a large labour pool of able bodied Russians we can put to work. We shall enact a scheme that will allow men to avoid the military draft in exchange for three years of mandatory service at state owned facilities, with social and financial incentives for each additional year they stay on."

 RUS_Reinstitute_The_Zemstva: "Reinstitute the Zemstva"
 RUS_Reinstitute_The_Zemstva_desc: "Zemstvo is a form of local governance and representation first introduced by Aleksandr II in 1864. It strongly weights favour to aristocrats but it still assures representation of the lower classes. It will, without a doubt, assure stability in our torn nation."

 RUS_National_Investment_Bank: "National Investment Bank"
 RUS_National_Investment_Bank_desc: "A national investment bank will safeguard not only the resources invested by the Zemstva, but should also offer beneficial loans to local projects. This bank will also help us to control many transactions of our Zemstva and the local businessmen."

 RUS_Local_Development: "Local Development"
 RUS_Local_Development_desc: "The large, bloated state apparatus of the past has often been a hindrance to local development as directives slowly trickled down through an inefficient chain of command. The best way to tackle this is to delegate more responsibilities to local structures of government led by the regional landowners. After all, who knows better how to improve local affairs than the people that own those land?"

 RUS_Zemstvo_Research_Initiatives: "Zemstva Research Initiatives"
 RUS_Zemstvo_Research_Initiatives_desc: "Economies, and businesses, need to be kept competitive in order to grow and expand. We should invest not only in these actual businesses but also the theories behind them. With sufficient science funding, it should benefit not only local companies, but Russia as a whole."

 RUS_War_Preparations_Programme: "War Preparations Programme"
 RUS_War_Preparations_Programme_desc: "With Russia's economy once again looking strong there's no doubt that our neighbours will look at us with envy. We must make no mistake, a civilian economy in a time of war would end the rising star in a matter of months."

 RUS_Funding_Frenzy: "Funding Frenzy"
 RUS_Funding_Frenzy_desc: "By offering more economic support and tax reductions to the Zemstva, we can make sure they start funding local projects like never before. More over it will strengthen the connections between the people of Russia and these new established state authorities."

 RUS_Bureaucratic_Overhaul: "Bureaucratic Overhaul"
 RUS_Bureaucratic_Overhaul_desc: "Our economy should, no matter what our government may look like, be governed by faceless but loyal bureaucrats. We need to remove the old Guard of the Kerensky regime and set up something else. Something new."

 RUS_MinProm: "MinProm"
 RUS_MinProm_desc: "Ministry of Industry or \"MinProm\" in Russian is a united ministry, which will reorganise the industry in our country. Its first task will be to delegate industrial investments to several urban centres in order to boost our industry logically."

 RUS_Agricultural_Modernisation: "Agricultural Modernisation"
 RUS_Agricultural_Modernisation_desc: "In the eyes of the rest of the world, Russia is considered a backwards, poor country. We will show them that they are wrong, harnessing the massive resources hidden in the countryside through new technologies."

 RUS_Military_Production_Act: "Military Production Act"
 RUS_Military_Production_Act_desc: "Many of our military setbacks in the Weltkrieg were the result of shortages and shortcomings due to our outdated military industry. Proposed by our lawmakers, the MPA seeks to impose new standards and regulations on our military industry to bolster production quotas. While meeting these standards will be costly in the short term, it'll allow us to improve our production in the long term."

 RUS_Economic_Efficiency_Act: "Economic Efficiency Act"
 RUS_Economic_Efficiency_Act_desc: "Russia was the last great power in Europe to industrialise and as a result our industries have struggled to compete with its western rivals. The newly proposed ECA seeks to rectify this by creating a new legal framework for industrial production and safety standards. Though costly in the short term, it will be worth it once Russian factories can outproduce their western competitors in both quality and quantity!"

 RUS_National_Administration_School: "National Administration School"
 RUS_National_Administration_School_desc: "With the new bureaucracy steadily growing we should set up a National Administration School which prepares our future army of bureaucrats for the necessary work ahead of them."

 RUS_Cooperative_Capitalism: "Cooperative Capitalism"
 RUS_Cooperative_Capitalism_desc: "In the spirit of democracy, we should grant strong, local governance to the communes of our nation. Russia is a massive nation and to believe that it could all be governed from a single place is crazy!"

 RUS_New_Industrial_Programme: "New Industrial Programme"
 RUS_New_Industrial_Programme_desc: "By industrialising the far reaches of our country side we do not only make sure our whole nation stays alive, but also that targeting our industries becomes much more difficult for our enemies. Moreover, it will help us to reduce the unemployment rate in Russia."

 RUS_Industry_In_The_Urals: "Industry in the Urals"
 RUS_Industry_In_The_Urals_desc: "When the industrial revolution came to Russia its riches rarely stretched beyond the major cities. Beyond the Ural Mountains many localities rely on the same trades that they have since Ivan IV's eastward expansion. Instead of further industrialising the already wealthy cities, it's high time that we brought the riches of the Industrial revolution to the Urals and beyond."

 RUS_The_Wealth_Of_Siberia: "The Wealth of Siberia"
 RUS_The_Wealth_Of_Siberia_desc: "Beneath the Siberian soil there's an immense untapped wealth of resources. Metals, minerals and fuels that surpass the output of entire empires is within our reach. By investing capital and expertise into the neglected regions of our east, we can turn Siberia into an economic powerhouse as the crown jewel of our resource industry."

 RUS_Education_Campaigns: "Education Campaigns"
 RUS_Education_Campaigns_desc: "The Russian nation, torn apart by social and political unrest, has been unable to initiate any massive education programmes successfully. There's still a large rural population dominating the countryside. A school in every village will allow us to integrate even more people in our society and economy."

 RUS_Decentralised_Logistics: "Decentralised Logistics"
 RUS_Decentralised_Logistics_desc: "Russia's size is both her greatest strength and her greatest weakness. As hard as it is for hostile armies to remain in supply, it is so too for our armies. By establishing local supply points in key areas, we can make sure our troops stay in good supply at all times."

 RUS_Expand_The_Transsiberian: "Expand the Transsiberian Railroad"
 RUS_Expand_The_Transsiberian_desc: "The importance of the Transsiberian Railway to our military and economy cannot be overstated. With the infrastructure therein strained by growth, we must expand it, building new railways and junctions using newer technology."

 RUS_Research_Investments: "Research Investments"
 RUS_Research_Investments_desc: "With our heavy investment in our industry and economy, we have managed to free up more resources to be put into research. In the end, it will pay off greatly."

 RUS_Project_Kremlin: "RDS-1"
 RUS_Project_Kremlin_desc: "The Russian nuclear scientist corps led by Igor Kurchatov have given us a petition, informing us about the destructive potential of the split atom, and that we need to harness this power before our enemies do."

 RUS_Project_Kostikov: "Project Katyusha"
 RUS_Project_Kostikov_desc: "Championed by the young, yet exceptional inventor Andrey Kostikov, Project Katyusha will delve into the potential of jet engines and militarised rocketry. Should they prove to be practical, jets will turn our fighters into supersonic vultures and rockets will deal our enemies death from above..."

 RUS_Resource_Prospection: "Resource Prospection"
 RUS_Resource_Prospection_desc: "Minerals are numerous in Russia and can boost the economy rapidly. That's why we have to initiate an extraction of various minerals in the whole country."

 RUS_Army_Modernisation: "Army Modernisation"
 RUS_Army_Modernisation_desc: "No matter what plan we rely on, we have to modernise not only our tactics, but indeed our very rifles and general equipment."

 RUS_Okhrannoye_Otdeleniye: "Okhrannoye Otdeleniye"
 RUS_Okhrannoye_Otdeleniye_desc: "With revolutionary movements active throughout Russia, some members of the Duma are suggesting a complete reorganisation of the internal police on the basis of the old Tsarist secret police, 'Okhrannoye Otdeleniye'. This organisation will hunt down any radical revolutionary elements and \"re-educate\" them to respect the Russian state!"

 RUS_Electronic_Warfare: "Electronic Warfare"
 RUS_Electronic_Warfare_desc: "Modern wars are only partially won on the battlefield. Equally important are the men and women behind desks and radios, dealing with intelligence and transmissions. We need to make their work easier."

 RUS_Front_Line_Commissars: "Front Line Commissars"
 RUS_Front_Line_Commissars_desc: "The Okhrannoye Otdeleniye was given posts in our military high command to prevent dangerous revolutionaries from agitating the troops, we won't let this happen again."

 RUS_Equipment_Modernisation: "Equipment Modernisation"
 RUS_Equipment_Modernisation_desc: "We have come some part of the way, but there's still more that we can do. The core of any army is, in the end, the artillery and the rifle, just like in the Weltkrieg."

 RUS_Defensive_Measures: "Defensive Measures"
 RUS_Defensive_Measures_desc: "No plan survives contact with the enemy, and the war with Germany is not guaranteed to go our way. It would be wise to create countermeasures in case we are forced to retreat - Moscow must not fall into enemy hands."

 RUS_Rearmament_Programme: "Rearmament Programme"
 RUS_Rearmament_Programme_desc: "As tensions between the French and Germans continue to increase, the world finds itself closer and closer to the outbreak of a new war, one that will define the future of Europe. We must be ready to confront Germany when the time comes, and, to that end, we must embark on an ambitious programme to rearm the Russian Army."

 RUS_Special_Forces_Office: "Special Forces Office"
 RUS_Special_Forces_Office_desc: "Our chief of staff believes that while weight isn't bad, finesse is definitely the better option. With elite units trained for specific circumstances, we can cut enemy lines apart."

 RUS_Army_Motorisation: "Army Motorisation"
 RUS_Army_Motorisation_desc: "Mechanisation of our infantry is very expensive but would offer substantial protection, firepower and mobility to our leg infantry. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it."

 RUS_VVSR: "VVSR"
 RUS_VVSR_desc: "The VVSR (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily Rossii, 'Russian Military Air Force') is badly outdated. We use the same planes and tactics today that we did twenty years ago. By expanding our air-bases and training new recruits we could change this."

 RUS_The_ORT_System: "The ORT System"
 RUS_The_ORT_System_desc: "The Okhrannoye Otdeleniye are ready to set up a so-called Radio Technology System, inspired by foreign technologies. They believe they could keep track of any hostile troop movements if only they are fed enough resources."

 RUS_Disorganisation: "Disorganisation"
 RUS_Disorganisation_desc: "Enemy land forces can be defeated safely from the air, often even without directly engaging them. Our bombers could be used to disrupt supply lines and take out key industry far from the battle front."

 RUS_Air_Superiority: "Air Superiority"
 RUS_Air_Superiority_desc: "While bombers may damage our opposition, not a single one of them will reach their targets without sufficient protection from our fighters. These fighters can also provide cover for our own troops and industry."

 RUS_Wing_Formations: "Wing Formations"
 RUS_Wing_Formations_desc: "Every single pilot needs to operate closer together with smaller formations of planes, divided into squadrons and wings."

 RUS_Naval_Bomber_Development: "Naval Bomber Development"
 RUS_Naval_Bomber_Development_desc: "At sea, a single wing of naval bombers can be just as efficient as any ship. We need to develop this type of bomber further."

 RUS_Create_The_VDV: "Create the VDV"
 RUS_Create_The_VDV_desc: "Some of the more experimental members of our high command suggests that the motorisation of our troops was only the first step. The next step would be to move infantry not by ships or by trucks, but by planes! By dropping so called paratroopers behind enemy lines we can cut off enemy units and hit supply points."

 RUS_High_Command_Reforms: "High Command Reforms"
 RUS_High_Command_Reforms_desc: "The Military High Command holds many fossils of old who have learned little from the Weltkrieg and the civil war. They need to be replaced with people who understand the type of warfare we hope to conduct."

 RUS_Extensive_Planning: "Extensive Planning"
 RUS_Extensive_Planning_desc: "Some members of our chief of staff believe in discipline, thorough logistical planning and organisational integrity above all else. With extensive planning and a general motorisation, they believe that they can make the Russian army the greatest in the world!"

 RUS_Military_Infrastructure: "Military Infrastructure"
 RUS_Military_Infrastructure_desc: "Our modernisation plans require large amounts of preparation, including setting up important supply points at key locations. Railroads and highways must stretch from end to end in Russia!"

 RUS_Mechanised_Divisions: "Mechanised Divisions"
 RUS_Mechanised_Divisions_desc: "Much like with planes, tanks, ships and rifles our mechanised units need to be further developed, all to meet the requirements of modern war."

 RUS_National_Planning_School: "National Planning School"
 RUS_National_Planning_School_desc: "Our staff believes that Russia doesn't need to rely on \"wasting lives\" at the front lines, if our officers receive proper training and stick to our closely monitored battle plans. New officer schools designed to train young officers on how to follow these plans should be set up."

 RUS_Overwhelming_Firepower: "Overwhelming Firepower"
 RUS_Overwhelming_Firepower_desc: "Some members of our high command advocate for the theories of overwhelming firepower as the cornerstone of our modernisation programme, hammering enemy positions with artillery before attacking. Additionally, more initiative and responsibility needs to be given to the officer at the front-line."

 RUS_Commander_Initiative: "Commander Initiative"
 RUS_Commander_Initiative_desc: "High command believes we should give our lower ranking officers clear goals and resources to fulfil those goals, but leave the planning in their hands. This will allow them to take local circumstances into consideration and help them respond accordingly to any changes in those circumstances, making our forces more flexible."

 RUS_National_High_Command_Formation_School: "National High Command Formation School"
 RUS_National_High_Command_Formation_School_desc: "The final step of our modernisation plan, before our army stands unmatched, requires us to invest heavily into the officers which we will entrust the front lines to. A National High Command Formation School should help us find the most suitable recruits, leaving us with a new elite officer corps."

 RUS_Spearhead_Doctrine: "Spearhead Doctrine"
 RUS_Spearhead_Doctrine_desc: "While the ideas of a primarily motorised force are foreign to many in the Republic's general staff, some members of our high command are insisting that a fully mechanised force is the kind of military innovation needed to safeguard the country. Russian tank armies swiftly striking through enemy lines is quite the image!"

 RUS_Armour_Modernisation: "Armour Modernisation"
 RUS_Armour_Modernisation_desc: "High command's strategic theories are not enough. We need up to date armoured units, to fulfil the strategies devised by our foremost military experts."

 RUS_National_Armoured_School: "National Armoured School"
 RUS_National_Armoured_School_desc: "High command has suggested that establishing a national school for armoured training would help us master the art of mobile warfare as we'll find the most talented men in Russia to lead our armoured spearheads."

 RUS_Import_Foreign_Specialists: "Import Foreign Specialists"
 RUS_Import_Foreign_Specialists_desc: "Our country never had an armoured division before our recent reforms and is lacking competent commanders and theorists to make our divisions effective. Fortunately the world is full of these men - all we have to do is invite them to our country."

 RUS_War_Of_Numbers: "War of Numbers"
 RUS_War_Of_Numbers_desc: "More conservative members of the Russian high command suggest that we should continue to rely on our huge numbers to win any future wars, just as Russia has in the past. Going forward with such a plan would be the easiest and quickest way of reforming the Russian army model."

 RUS_Mass_Mobilisation: "Mass Mobilisation"
 RUS_Mass_Mobilisation_desc: "Based on the lessons learned in the Weltkrieg, we know that the Russian army is unstoppable once the numbers are provided. It's time we provide them with a new recruitment programme."

 RUS_Equipment_Standardisation: "Equipment Standardisation"
 RUS_Equipment_Standardisation_desc: "By standardising our equipment, and how we produce it, we can assure that our ever-growing army will never lack for rifles. Unarmed men will serve the army quite poorly despite the best efforts of our officers, or so the generals tell us."

 RUS_A_Well_Equipped_Force: "A Well-Equipped Force"
 RUS_A_Well_Equipped_Force_desc: "Just like high command envisioned, we now have a large, well-equipped army applying modern tactics. The Russian Army will be unstoppable and our lands unconquerable. There will not be another Brest-Litovsk!"

 RUS_Local_Training_Barracks: "Local Training Barracks"
 RUS_Local_Training_Barracks_desc: "Every city, every town, every hamlet should hold their own army barracks, where low ranking officers train the local men into militia formations. This will help our high command find the men most suited for active service and should shorten the time needed for regular training."

 RUS_Navy_Modernisation: "Navy Modernisation"
 RUS_Navy_Modernisation_desc: "If we are to stand proud among the great nations of Europe again, we must build a new, modern navy that can challenge the great powers of Europe and the world."

 RUS_Death_From_Above: "Death From Above"
 RUS_Death_From_Above_desc: "Before the revolution some of our naval staff members visited [RUS_naval_officers_target], and it made them believe that the future of naval warfare is the aircraft carrier. While these ships are expensive, they claim that while Weltkrieg naval warfare was dominated by dreadnoughts, they will soon be overshadowed by massive aircraft carriers and the punching power of naval bombers."

 RUS_Floating_Fortresses: "Floating Fortresses"
 RUS_Floating_Fortresses_desc: "Many officers of the old school believe in the power of discipline and of majestic dreadnoughts based on experiences in the Weltkrieg and the Russian civil war. They advocate for these massive warships to remain the centrepieces of our navy."

 RUS_War_Under_The_Sea: "War Under the Sea"
 RUS_War_Under_The_Sea_desc: "While carriers and battleships may be the future, it may not be realistic for our young republic to focus on these massive ships. Building a large navy is expensive and [RUS.GetNameDef] does not have the dockyards nor the resources to produce a fleet of that size. Instead we should focus on the cheaper but equally deadly submarines to harass enemy shipping lanes."

 RUS_The_Invisible_Navy: "The Invisible Navy"
 RUS_The_Invisible_Navy_desc: "The Weltkrieg taught us that it isn't always the biggest naval gun that wins the war. Cheap, silent and deadly submarines can bring entire empires to their knees. With our shipbuilding capacity limited by Brest-Litovsk, focusing on these types of vessels will allow us to quickly regain an offensive capacity in the deep oceans."

 RUS_Coastal_Defences: "Coastal Defences"
 RUS_Coastal_Defences_desc: "Because our naval capacity has historically been less than that of our natural rivals, many of our naval theoreticians are advocating for a defensive stance against the enemy. By focusing on mining the seas, we could limit their movement at sea and cause losses to their fleets while exposing ourselves to minimal risk."

 RUS_A_Destroyer_Armada: "A Destroyer Armada"
 RUS_A_Destroyer_Armada_desc: "Destroyers are the backbone of every navy. Considering the Reichspakt's dominance in the Baltics, this will be doubly true for us. Swift, resourceful, and fast to build, a large force of these ships will be needed if we are to contest the straits and make it into the open seas."

 RUS_Fleet_Protectors: "Fleet Protectors"
 RUS_Fleet_Protectors_desc: "Until we finish our naval expansion programme every ship is valuable and difficult to replace. By having our cruisers act as defensive centrepieces able to protect our screens and capital ships alike, our admiralty believes that we'll be able to greatly improve the survivability of our naval assets."

 RUS_Commerce_Raiders: "Commerce Raiders"
 RUS_Commerce_Raiders_desc: "Modern cruisers have proved very effective in the past as commerce raiders by combining good mobility with great firepower. Given their potential and our need to strike at the arteries of our enemies, we should devote more resources towards maximising their effectiveness in this particular role."

 RUS_Fleet_Vanguards: "Fleet Vanguards"
 RUS_Fleet_Vanguards_desc: "Striking a middle ground between larger battleships and smaller screens, cruisers are a versatile type of ship that can strike hard without being a disproportionate drain on our limited resources. By modernising their offensive gunnery we'll effectively turn these ships into pocket battleships, hard-hitting ships able to stand up to capital ships in a fight."

 RUS_Naval_Infantry: "Naval Infantry"
 RUS_Naval_Infantry_desc: "Landings against fortified enemy islands or beaches carried out by regular infantry without special training and equipment is a disaster waiting to happen. If we are to take the holdings of the empires to our west, south and east, we'll need to establish a new branch of marine infantry to act as the vanguard in any future naval invasion."

 RUS_New_Tactics_For_New_Ships: "New Tactics for New Ships"
 RUS_New_Tactics_For_New_Ships_desc: "Modern ships are barely any more useful than the ships of the last century if we don't update our naval doctrine as well. Ready as ever, the admiralty has outlined a doctrinal modernisation plan that will help us rapidly overhaul our tactics and retrain our officers."

 RUS_Modernise_The_Petrograd_Dockyards: "Modernise the Petrograd Dockyards"
 RUS_Modernise_The_Petrograd_Dockyards_desc: "With Petrograd being the largest port city in western Russia, it's only natural that it will serve as the linchpin for any fleet expansion project. With a relatively modern infrastructure and skilled engineers already in place, modernising its dockyards is the fastest way of expanding our shipbuilding capacity."

 RUS_Modernise_Murmansk: "Modernise Murmansk"
 RUS_Modernise_Murmansk_desc: "As a gateway into the Barents Sea, Murmansk could be turned into a pivotal strategic location for our northern navy. Though its facilities are as of yet underdeveloped, expanding them could allow us to move submarines and other ships into the North Sea and beyond into the Atlantic, bypassing any western navies in the Baltic Sea."

 RUS_Recover_Foreign_Blueprints: "Recover Foreign Blueprints"
 RUS_Recover_Foreign_Blueprints_desc: "As a result of the decades lost to turmoil, we've fallen significantly behind several of our competitors. With the right resources and connections, however, we could learn from their efforts to speed up our own naval research programme."

 RUS_Submarines_In_Nikolayevsk: "Submarines in Nikolayevsk"
 RUS_Submarines_In_Nikolayevsk_desc: "The loss of Vladivostok primed a generation of naval reformers to focus on smaller and more cost-effective ways to safeguard the Pacific. With all of the Sea of Okhotsk within its reach, basing a submarine fleet in Nikolayevsk would let us strike at any potential enemy throughout the entire Pacific theatre of operations."

 RUS_Repair_Sevastopol: "Repair Sevastopol"
 RUS_Repair_Sevastopol_desc: "With Crimea once again under Russian control we finally have a warm water port to the south and a permanent foothold in the Black Sea. However, its facilities are currently built with Ukrainian and Reichspakt specifications in mind. We need to rebuild and overhaul Crimea's shipyards and ports to fully utilise its potential!"

 RUS_Repair_Vladivostok: "Repair Vladivostok"
 RUS_Repair_Vladivostok_desc: "With Vladivostok back under our control we're finally in a position to contest the other world powers for dominance over the Pacific ocean. After decades of Kolchak's neglect and Japanese influence, however, it's pivotal that we renovate the port and bring it up to our naval specification."

 RUS_Battleship_Development: "Battleship Development"
 RUS_Battleship_Development_desc: "From the carracks of old to the contemporary dreadnoughts, capital ships have been the centrepiece of every major navy for countless centuries. Building these mighty warships isn't just a massive boon to our navies, but also a clear sign to the rest of the world that we have overcome the injustices of Brest-Litovsk once and for all."

 RUS_Carrier_Development: "Carrier Development"
 RUS_Carrier_Development_desc: "While the old guard speaks fondly of battleships, a new generation of naval theoreticians speak of the potential of the aircraft carrier as the future centrepiece of our navies. Each of these floating airfields can carry an armada of fighters and bombers directly into the heart of our foes, giving us unmatched power projection potential."

 RUS_Realpolitik: "Realpolitik"
 RUS_Realpolitik_desc: "Realpolitik is politics or diplomacy based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than explicit ideological notions or moral and ethical premises. The term Realpolitik is sometimes used pejoratively to imply politics that are coercive, amoral, or Machiavellian. We enjoy this notion."

 RUS_Expansionism: "Expansionism"
 RUS_Expansionism_desc: "The theory of expansionism constitutes that Russia's borders are only as safe as they are distant from our heartland. Every neighbouring state which is not a puppet of the Russian state is, as such, a threat or a target, depending on their military and political strength. Needless to say, this adaptation of policies will not be well-liked by the rest of the world."

 RUS_Secure_Central_Asia: "Secure Central Asia"
 RUS_Secure_Central_Asia_desc: "A decade of continued instability has left Russia's power projection weakened, and allowed its sphere of influence to slowly be eroded away. The isolated region of Central Asia, once part of the Russian Empire, should prove a good starting point in restoring Russian influence in the global stage."

 RUS_The_Road_To_War: "The Road to War"
 RUS_The_Road_To_War_desc: "Tensions are rising across Europe, and Russia cannot allow itself to stay out of the war which is due to break out. The conflict between Germany and France is our only chance to reclaim the lost territories in the West - and we need to prepare the country for this goal."

 RUS_Seek_Allies: "Seek Allies"
 RUS_Seek_Allies_desc: "With our geopolitical bloc established, it's time we sought out allies. We cannot hope to take on Germany alone, and there are many countries around Russia willing to align themselves with someone other than the Reichspakt or the Internationale - be it because of historical ties with Russia or simple pragmatism."

 RUS_The_Academy_Of_Sciences: "The Academy of Sciences"
 RUS_The_Academy_Of_Sciences_desc: "We should foster deeper cooperation between our allies by creating a collective research initiative. The Russian Academy of Sciences, already a gateway for Western scientific thought into Russia, will serve us well as the foundation of this initiative."

 RUS_Crush_The_German_Hegemony: "Crush the German Hegemony"
 RUS_Crush_The_German_Hegemony_desc: "The time has come for us to end the injustices inflicted from the first Weltkrieg and strike back at the damnable Kaiser. Brest-Litovsk shall be avenged!"

 RUS_Enemy_In_The_East: "Enemy in the East"
 RUS_Enemy_In_The_East_desc: "Ever since the Russo-Japanese war the true enemy of Russia has, and will always be, the rising Empire in the East. The extremely rich and populous regions of China would also serve us very well."

 RUS_country_intro_header: "A Troubled History"
 RUS_country_intro_content: "The February Revolution put an end to centuries of Tsarist despotism, but its achievements were on the verge of being undone. In October of 1917, the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, stormed the Winter Palace and seized control of Russia, declaring the world's first revolutionary socialist state, Soviet Russia. A wide front of monarchists, republicans, moderate socialists and foreign interventionists rose up against it. The Bolshevik revolution was stillborn - in September of 1918, Lenin was assassinated by Fanny Kaplan, a disgruntled Left SR, and the Bolshevik cause began to disintegrate. This, combined with German supplies provided to the White Movement throughout the civil war, meant that by 1920, the revolution was successfully suppressed.\n\nIn 1922, the White generals dictated a constitution for the new Russian Republic, which, albeit democratic, was riddled with issues and did not satisfy everyone. Hoping that he would prove to be a weak figurehead, the Whites pushed forward Aleksandr Kerensky, the leader of the Provisional Government before the October coup, as the first President of the Russian Republic. Kerensky would prove to be capable, however, as he survived the 1925 Kolchak Putsch and implemented New Economic Policy to restore economic growth, and has governed the country for the past fifteen years. A lack of serious political opposition and widespread electoral manipulation have certainly helped his longevity as well.\n\nBy 1936, however, President Kerensky has eroded the last of his allies in the government, and New Economic Policy is no longer yielding any dividends. Nationalists see him kowtow to Germans, democrats believe that he is turning into a dictator, and socialists simply want the entire system gone. All of them share one belief, however - that Russia still has potential to assert its power in the world..."

 RUS_country_intro_header_1: "The Russian Constitution of 1922"
 RUS_country_intro_content_1: "Signed in 1922, after the end of the Russian Civil War and five years after the February Revolution, the Constitution of the Russian Republic is a scar of the fractured White movement which saw its adoption. It defines Russia as a federal democratic republic, guarantees universal freedoms and rights to every citizen of the Republic, and is the document by which the country's political institutions have been organised since then.\n\nIn some ways, the Constitution is an updated version of the Tsarist constitution of 1906 - the upper house of the Parliament, the Senate, is the main example of this authoritarian heritage. It is an unelected institution composed of senior statemen and delegates from upper strata, such as aristocrats, university professors and business associations. The lower house, the State Duma, is elected and holds most of the legislative power in the country. The presence of the unelected Senate curbs democratic process in the country, however.\n\nThe President is elected by the Senate, but many of his powers and duties are styled after the position of Tsar in the 1906 Constitution - therefore, he holds significant executive power, and appoints the Council of Ministers with the approval of both legislative houses. The President is the primary actor in executing legislative acts and represents the Republic in foreign affairs. He also has access to the infamous Article 48 of the Constitution, which allows the President to take emergency actions without the approval of the Duma. President Aleksandr Kerensky has grown fond of using this power to bypass the increasingly fractured legislature and thus pass decrees and laws.\n\nDrafted under the guidance of the White Generals, the Constitution can only call itself a protector of democracy when its articles are not used against it."
 russia.2.a: "At least the Constitution guarantees stability!"

 RUS_country_intro_header_2: "New Economic Policy"
 RUS_country_intro_content_2: "The Russian Civil War left the economy of the Republic in a pitiful position - the conflict had devastated the country and left millions dead, famine was breaking out in the Volga Region and anarchy reigned across much of the country. The government of Aleksandr Kerensky had a lot of political capital and used it for a vast series of economic stimulus programmes dubbed "New Economic Policy" (Novaya ekonomicheskaya politika)\n\nThe NEP combined financial stabilisation with concessions to the progressive movement. A new currency was introduced, the Chervonets Ruble, backed by the gold standard, which put an end to rampant inflation. The de facto land redistribution in the countryside was recognised and additional land reform promulgated in order to restore the efficiency of agriculture. A restored agricultural sector allowed Russia to become an exporter and use the revenue from these exports, combined with considerable American and German investment, to restore industrial zones and rebuild the rail system. By the late 1920s, Russia was one of the fastest growing economies on the planet with plenty of potential to spare.\n\nThe economic miracle began to slow down by 1933. The Great Depression in America depreciated investment in Russia, agricultural efficiency stopped growing due to lacking mechanisation, and the gold standard was shackling finances, rather than stabilising them. By 1936, the state has entered a full on recession.\n\nAlthough some hold out hope that the prosperous German market will salvage Russia, the consensus is that New Economic Policy has run its course and a change in policy is needed. Should Russia recover and its economy once again become vibrant, however, its untapped potential will likely turn it to an industrial giant."
 russia.3.a: "We should strengthen the economy."

### Events ###
 russia.5.t: "The Assassination of Kerensky"
 russia.5.d: "The sound of gunfire rings across the capital. Aleksandr Kerensky, the President of the Russian Republic, was shot and killed by an assassin while he was climbing the steps to the Senate House. His killer was shot dead by the military police before he could make his escape. His motives will forever be unknown. Regardless, the fate of Russia has been irrevocably changed."
 russia.5.a: "A shot that will ring across the world."

 russia.6.t: "The Aftermath of the Assassination of Kerensky"
 russia.6.d: "Kerensky may have been hated by many, but it was only when he died that it became clear how much Russia needed him. The coalition between Kadets and Socialist Revolutionaties has begun to dissolve immediately. Kerensky's right hand man, Viktor Chernov, who had usually handled the nitty gritty of coalition building while the President acted as the public face of the party, has suddenly found his job to be a lot harder. All while the right wing forces in the Senate and the Duma coalesce and gather their forces - their soon-to-be saviour is Grand Duke Dmitry, who has all the material to be a fine President in their eyes. Chernov's only hope is that the Left opposition, the Mensheviks and radical socialists represented by Irakliy Tsereteli and Aleksandr Shliapnikov, will put rivalries aside and join forces with the hated SRs and Kadets.\n\nAnti-democratic forces plot in the shadows, too. Pyotr Wrangel, the Black Baron, and Field Marshal Lavr Kornilov have independently drawn their plans on seizing control of the state for this exact occasion. They have no reason to play ball with the parliamentarians in Moscow now that Kerensky is gone, after all...\n\nWhatever may be the outcome of the January Crisis, it is bound to leave a lasting impact upon Russian history."
 russia.6.a: "The Mensheviks and Socialists agree to a coalition of the plural left."
 russia.6.b: "Chernov's coalition falls - the parliamentary right elects Dmitry Romanov."
 russia.6.c: "Baron Wrangel establishes martial law and strongarms the Duma in a bloodless putsch."
 russia.6.e: "Kornilov storms Moscow, the streets run red with blood!"

 russia.8.t: "Appointing an Acting President"
 russia.8.d: "At the last moment, thanks to Chernov's efforts, an agreement was found between all the forces to the left of the Kadets - the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, Socialists, Syndicalists and numerous others all joined into a plural left coalition for the defence of the Constitution. Though plenty of work needs to be done from here on out, it can safely be said that the hardest step has been passed.\n\nThe Left coalition has shown itself to be unwilling to bypass constitutional term limits and elect a President for a full term, therefore, only an Acting President will be appointed until the election of 1937. Several candidates have been proposed already, delegated by parties left and right. It is a time of chaos and uncertainty, however, so even factions which used to be weak could strongarm allies and crawl over heads to get the top spot..."
 russia.8.a: "Appease the Mensheviks, elect Irakliy Tsereteli."
 russia.8.b: "Viktor Chernov shall continue Kerensky's legacy!"
 russia.8.c: "Prime Minister Pavel Milyukov will restore order."
 russia.8.e: "Aleksandr Shlyapnikov forms a popular front of all socialist parties!"

 russia.9.t: "Appointing a Prime Minister"
 russia.9.d: "Having strongarmed the Duma to follow his orders, Pyotr Wrangel has been elected Acting President and is nominally in control of the country. He and his junta are faced with a dilemma, however - to ensure a smooth transition of power, he needs to form a collaborationist civilian government which will help him manage the day to day affairs of the state. Though the list of possible stooges is long, only a few of them bring the necessary skills and bases of support to prove of use, and this choice will determine where Wrangel's rulership shall lead."
 russia.9.a: "Keep Kerensky's Prime Minister, Pavel Milyukov."
 russia.9.b: "Patriarch Kirill will help us find popular support."
 russia.9.c: "Vladimir Purishkevich and the Union of the Russian People."
 russia.9.e: "Merge the offices of President and Prime Minister."

 russia.10.t: "The Kornilov Affair"
 russia.10.d: "The news that Kornilov's forces are descending upon Moscow sparked a repeat of 1917 - trade unions and leftist organisations broke out their arms to defend Russia's democracy and Constitution from a soon-to-be dictator. Kornilov chose not to retreat this time, however, and, cooperating with the Combat Squads, the paramilitary of the National Republican Party (NRPR), took the fight to streets. After hours of barricade raising and street clashes, order was finally restored, the Duma dissolved, and a provisional military government installed, headed by the new Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army and Acting President, Lavr Georgyevich Kornilov.\n\nHowever, he also understands that without a coherent political programme, his control over the country will swiftly be lost. The temporary prime-minister, General Aleksandr Lukomskiy, a well-known supporter of Kornilov, can maintain a modicum of order, but he has awful relations with almost all republican factions in the country. Kornilov's first choice would be to invite Boris Savinkov, the leader of the NRPR, to assume the office of Prime Minister. Though he is far from being on the best of terms with Savinkov, his far-right concept of national renewal sounds very appealing. On the other hand, perhaps Savinkov is too suspicious to trust and Marshal Denikin would help Kornilov consolidate his control over the country..."
 russia.10.a: "Invite the Vozhd into the government!"
 russia.10.b: "Bring in Marshal Denikin instead!"

 russia.37.t: "The Kornilov-Savinkov Alliance"
 russia.37.d: "The boogeyman of any socialist in the Duma and the most powerful far right force in the country, the \"National Republican Party\" (Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii) once started out as an anti-Bolshevik conspiracy in Moscow, the 'Union for the Defence of the Motherland'. Its leader, Boris Savinkov, is one of the most interesting political leaders in the country, a former Socialist-Revolutionary terrorist turned nationalist politician, who has developed a political ideology based on his own extreme and somewhat esoteric beliefs, and the influence of his close allies such as Symbolist poet Dmitry Merezhkovskiy.\n\nHaving remained at the fringe of Russian politics in the 1920s, the NRPR exploded in popularity in the 1930s, its affinity to spectacle politics, populism, paramilitary violence and irredentism attracting many, and even inspiring imitators outside of Russia. Approached by Kornilov, his old ally from back in 1917, Savinkov accepted and has dedicated the NRPR Combat Squads to the apparatus of the state."
 russia.37.a: "Kornilov and Savinkov shall save holy Russia!"

 russia.38.t: "Assassination of Maria Spiridonova"
 russia.38.d: "During a meeting of the left SRs in Moscow, Maria Spiridonova was assassinated by members of Savinkov's Combat Squads. The liquidation of such a prominent Socialist leader provoked an early and consequently ill-organised rebellion against the government. The rising was easily suppressed by a concert of the police and Combat Squads. Today, General Kornilov published a new law prohibiting the Left SR party and proscribing its leaders. With the flower of its leadership cut down by the scythe of the state, the Socialist Revolutionaries no longer pose any threat to the Kornilov-Savinkov diarchy."
 russia.38.a: "Thus unto all enemies of the state!"

 russia.39.t: "Kornilov's Death"
 russia.39.d.savinkov: "Lavr Georgyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief and President of Russia, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68. With Kornilov gone nothing stands in the way of Savinkov merging the posts of prime minister and president and thus becoming unassailable in his leadership over Russia. The merger was approved by a dubious plebiscite where more than 90 percent of the electorate voted \"Da\" (Yes). Savinkov now rules a potent and aggravated nation, ready to shed itself of the many humiliations faced since the Weltkrieg and step into the sun once more. The Vozhd commands!"
 russia.39.d.denikin: "Lavr Georgyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief and President of Russia, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68. Two cliques are poised to seize control after Kornilov's passing. The first, led by Field Marshal Anton Denikin, favours continued authoritarian military rule solidified by strong traditionalism. In opposition stands the young officers of Baron Pyotr Wrangel. By no means a liberal, the Baron, however, knows that Russia must modernise and the societal issues of the state be resolved by a certain amount of governmental pragmatism."
 russia.39.a: "The great helmsman of the Russian nation is no more."
 russia.39.b: "Field marshal Denikin succeeds him!"
 russia.39.c: "Baron Wrangel rallies the reformist officers!"

 russia.40.t: "Directive No. 1"
 russia.40.d: "With the merger of the offices of president and prime minister, Boris Savinkov continued to solidify his grip over the Russian State by penning Directive No. 1 (also known as the first 'Prikaz Vozhdya'), technically an application of Article 48 of the Constitution. Amongst other things, the directive dismissed the Duma whilst outlawing all political parties besides Savinkov's own 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii'. Furthermore, the directive raised the Combat Squads to the status of a state organisation and an auxiliary force to the Russian army, tasked to enforce ideological control of the nation.\n\nTo fulfil his revanchist ideals, Savinkov chose to appoint a close ally of his party, entrepreneur and industrialist Aleksey Putilov, as his Minister of the Economy. Putilov has been tasked to transform the Russian economy into a war machine, without any reservations."
 russia.40.a: "No shortage of hooks to hang the enemies of the state."

 russia.42.t: "The Autocracy"
 russia.42.d: "With our power consolidated and some measure of stability brought to the country, the time has come to determine measures further promote the cause of order. Some are even arguing that we bring the political system back to the certainties of the Tsarist era."
 russia.42.a: "The choice is yours."

 russia.43.t: "The Future of Russia"
 russia.43.d: "Field marshal Denikin has seized the apparatus of state from his rivals within the military junta! An avowed traditionalist, Denikin is determined to keep the military's influence in its zenith as a bulwark against the dangers of degenerate socialism. However, some sort of political platform would be useful in securing the survival of a proper order in Russia and as such, it has been proposed that the military restore the Romanov dynasty as a national focal point. Or we could also continue with the Stavka-State."
 russia.43.a: "The choice is yours."

 russia.11.t: "Constitutional Monarchy"
 russia.11.d: "After much deliberation and political machinations the time have come to set up a constitutional monarchy headed by the legitimate Tsar!"
 russia.11.a: "A constitutional monarchy is just what we need to protect Russia!"
 russia.11.b: "Marshal Wrangel invites the pretender to lead a constitutional monarchy."
 russia.11.c: "Marshal Denikin invites the pretender to lead a constitutional monarchy."

 russia.12.t: "Tsar Kirill"
 russia.12.d: "It's been more than a year since Russia was thrown into chaos once again due to the unstable nature of democracies. It is time we restore the Russian Tsardom, with the legitimate Kirill Romanov on the throne!"
 russia.12.a: "Hurrah for the Tsar!"

 russia.13.t: "Tsar Vladimir"
 russia.13.d: "It's been more than a year since Russia was thrown into chaos once again due to the unstable nature of democracies. It is time we restore the Russian Tsardom, with the legitimate Vladimir Romanov on the throne!"

 russia.14.a: "Long Live Tsar Dmitry!"

 russia.16.t: "Aristocratic Republic"
 russia.16.d: "More than a year has passed since Kerensky's death, and Dmitry Romanov has decided to maintain the Russian republic with the support of the aristocracy."
 russia.16.a: "For the Republic!"

 russia.17.t: "Democratic Republic"
 russia.17.d: "More than a year has passed since Kerensky's death shook the Republic, and his successors have managed to preserve democracy in Russia."
 russia.17.a: "For the Republic!"

 pres_elections_dem_rep_popular_front: "As Bukharin was elected president in 1936 the next presidential elections will be held in 1940."

 russia.18.t: "Rise of the Vozhd"
 russia.18.d: "With the passing of Lavr Kornilov, Boris Savinkov and his radical NRPR supporters have managed to assume control over the entire country. The most important politician in the largest country of the world, Savinkov is hailed as the undisputed Vozhd (leader) of Russia and is ready to enforce his own ideology, which opposes both Syndicalism and the new Russian republican traditions, on the nation. The aim of this ideology is to reconstruct the Russian state into an entity capable of defending Russian interests and citizens all over the world. Savinkov won't stoop to dependency on either the Reichspakt nor on the defeated Entente - his new Russia will be stronger than any alliance in the world."
 russia.18.a: "Russia needs a strong state for a strong people!"

 russia.182.t: "The Final Step?"
 russia.182.d: "With Wrangel being in power for such a long time many people are suggesting that a formal coronation should take place, thereby legitimising his authority over Russia."
 russia.182.a: "A foolish proposal."
 russia.182.b: "Very well, begin the preparations!"

 russia.183.t: "The Soldier State"
 russia.183.d: "The Military led by the Field marshals Wrangel and Denikin has now firmly established its rule in Russia, the legacy of the Whites live on and once again they rise to protect the Motherland from internal and external threats. With them Russia has nothing to fear."
 russia.183.a: "Hurrah!"

 russia.20.t: "The 100th Anniversary of Pushkin's Death"
 russia.20.d: "Yesterday a new monument, built to commemorate one of Russia's greatest poets, has been uncovered in our capital. The 100th anniversary of Pushkin's death is a chance to recall the great days of Russian history and culture, an act of paramount importance during these dark times of crisis and instability."
 russia.20.a: "We all love our poets!"

 russia.21.t: "'Genghis Khan's Legacy', Nikolay Trubetskoy"
 russia.21.d: "A famous linguist and historian, Prince Nikolay Trubetskoy turned to politics in the 1930s and has now chosen to codify his ideological doctrine of Eurasianism into a single book - \"Genghis Khan's Legacy: A Look at Russian History from the East\". It has already begun making rounds across Russian literary circles and crude quotes are being passed around across the public.\n\nEurasianism believes in the concept of "living space" ("mesto dlya razvitiya"), geographical conditions which define the peoples living within them. People who live in the same biome or geographic area form a common civilisation and have a natural desire to unite. Russia, in their view, forms the core of a "steppe civilisation" which encompasses all peoples in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Eurasianists ascribe them a collective kinship and call for them to unite under Russian rule. Trubetskoy declares that the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and therefore Russia, is the successor to the Mongol Empire and Genghis Khan was a hero of the Russian people.\n\nThis "Russia-Eurasia" needs to embody ideas and beliefs which Eurasianists believe are "Eurasian" - selflessness, heroism, societal hierarchy and obedience. Eurasianists believe that democracy is a form of governance for "sea peoples" and is completely unfitting for Russia - not only should Russia fight against democracy being imposed upon it, but also liberate other non-European nations from Western rule and defeat what they perceive as Western "cultural imperialism".\n\nAfter the publication of the book, its ideas have begun to float around the Russian right."
 russia.21.a: "An interesting concept indeed!"

 russia.22.t: "Never Another Brest-Litovsk"
 russia.22.d: "Now that the situation in Russia has begun to stabilise, the Russian people have begun to turn westward. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk has been paraded as an example of a punitive treaty since its inception, but only now has Russia gotten confident enough to consider repudiating it. Printing presses are publishing maps and treatises where Russia's western neighbours are declared \"German-occupied Western Territories\" and the locals living there are described as suffering, awaiting the return of Mother Russia. This is one issue which can unite the Russian right, left and centre, though for different reasons. Russian nationalists obviously seek revenge against Germany, whereas the leftists see Germany as the hegemon which prevents the rise of socialism and Syndicalism in Europe.\n\nNo matter what regime may be in charge, they will need to place the reconquest of Russia's western territories at the top of the priority list. Few want to see Russia start this war, however. The general line of thought among the Russian populace, intellectuals and politicians is that Russia needs to wait. Observe. And descend like a hawk when Germany is focused elsewhere. Cunning has saved Russia in countless wars before, and this moment will be no different."
 russia.22.a: "... and we can't wait to watch Berlin burn."

 russia.24.t: "Levyj Kartel'"
 russia.24.d: "The assassination of President Kerensky and the volatile political situation in Russia have led to the rise of new political forces and new alliances to sustain them. Hoping to consolidate the numerous marginalised far left parties under one banner, the Mensheviks have formed an electoral alliance with the People's Socialist Party and the Trade Union Socialist Party. This alliance, dubbed the \"Left Cartel\" (\"Levyj Kartel\"), is understandably shaky, but nevertheless presents a serious challenge to established political forces in Russia. In its alliance manifesto, the Cartel calls for democratic socialist reform in the Republic, a hostile stance towards German imperialism, and the maintenance of democratic institutions."
 russia.24.a: "We should keep a close eye on them!"
 russia.24.b: "Together we are stronger!"

 russia.1901.t: "Russia Surrenders"
 russia.1901.d: "A heavily encrypted telegram has just been delivered by a diplomat from [RUS.GetNameDef] today, bearing grave tidings. Due to heavy pressure and occupation by enemy forces, the Russian Army is unlikely to be able to mount a coordinated defence. As such, [RUS.GetLeader] has opted to go into exile, and mount a defence from their allies' territories. However, with the leader of the alliance in such a dire predicament, it is unlikely that us, and other members of the [RUS.GetFactionName] will pursue a prolonged conflict with the enemies of [RUS.GetNameDef], and will instead seek for peace, out of self-preservation. With this, the collapse of the [RUS.GetFactionName] will be inevitable."
 russia.1901.a: "It seems they were not a \"potential superpower\" after all."

 russia.1902.t: "The Fall of Russia"
 russia.1902.d: "Not long ago, [RUS.GetNameDef] was at the zenith of their power - fueled by revanchist sentiment, the Moscow Accord posed one of the most credible threats to the German world order. Some went as far as to say that, in a few years, Russia was poised to take Germany's place as world hegemon. \n\nHowever, its current war effort has proven to be disastrous. With several major cities fallen, the situation has reached the point where the Russian government can no longer offer serious resistance to its enemies, and has begun to seek peace terms - and with its defeat, the international alliance that it led has broken down. Its surviving members must now fend for themselves in an uncertain future."
 russia.1902.a: "Once more, the German spirit prevails."
  # Germany (and allies?)
 russia.1902.b: "The revolution must survive, with or without them."
  # Internationale, not at war

 russia.1917.t: "Revolution!"
 russia.1917.d.dmitriy: "After the \"Russian counter-revolution\" happened no one expected things to calm down anytime soon. Only the most cynical pessimists could have imagined that in a matter of weeks, Russia would be set ablaze with the fires of revolution once more. Although Kornilov's decision to transfer power to a civilian administration was enough to keep the centrists from breaking ranks with the rightists, the fact remained that the army's heavy-handed methods of mass arrests had caused the left in the country to overwhelmingly move towards more radical parties. With any hope for reform as dead as Kerensky, it was only a matter of time before many of them took to the streets.\n\nWhat started out as riots by radicals in Petrograd and Moscow quickly gained steam as the police was unable to quell them. When the army, allegedly acting by orders from Kornilov rather than Dmitry, stepped in it only made matters worse with its heavy-handed measures. As the days went on the riots grew in intensity with more and more people siding with the reds. Despite the best efforts of the civilian government to keep things under control, the fact of the matter is that it was a government in name only. It'd barely been inaugurated and had already lost any legitimacy it may once have had with a large portion of the country's population, particularly those victimised by Kornilov's draconian measures.\n\nMere days after the riots began to sweep the western parts of the nation, the army was forced to evacuate Dmitry and his cabinet from the capital. A provisional capital was set up in the east, and already preparations were made to fight to reclaim the western parts of the country. In the old capital, the revolutionaries that seized the moment may have done so without broad popular support, but once they were in power many regions surrounding Moscow and Petrograd soon joined ranks with them as many peasants and intellectuals alike seized the chance to gain by revolution what they could never gain through reform. Though the new socialist government is in a precarious position, it's already taking measures to mobilise militias and rally popular support as Russia seems to be spiralling towards yet another bloody civil war."
 russia.1917.d.kornilov: "After the \"Russian counter-revolution\" happened no one expected things to calm down anytime soon. Only the most cynical pessimists could have imagined that in a matter of weeks, Russia would be set ablaze with the fires of revolution once more. The heavy-handed approach of mass-arrests and numerous summary executions had managed to push many leftists towards more radical movements. Many liberals and even some conservatives were alienated by the drastic measures taken by the army, quickly eroding the broad support that Kornilov had in the initial days after the coup. Before long there were widespread protests in several major cities in Russia's western regions with only the army to stand against them.\n\nWhat started out as a mixture of people of all stripes voicing their dislike of Kornilov's autocratic methods quickly became dominated by the radical left, something Kornilov was all too happy to use as a justification to crack down even harder against them. As things spiralled out of control, the situation began to resemble that of 1917 more and more by the minute. What started out as soldiers disobeying orders to attack their countrymen soon spiralled into clashes between troops and Bolshevik rioters as the most radical elements on both sides took action when calmer heads seemed paralysed by confusion and hesitance.\n\nDays after the riots began to sweep the western parts of the nation, Kornilov ordered the bulk of his forces to withdraw eastwards in order to regroup and prepare to fight back against the reds. Meanwhile in the old capital, a loose coalition of moderate socialists and various strands of Bolsheviks had seized power and formed a shaky government. As Kornilov's authority in the west evaporated, many peasants and city-dwellers alike, many victims of the recent repression, soon joined up with the revolutionaries. Though the socialist government's situation is currently precarious at best, it has already started to mobilise militias and army deserters to take arms against Kornilov's expected counter-attack aimed at retaking the capital from the reds. Russia is now on an inevitable course towards yet another bloody civil war."
 russia.1917.a: "We shall defeat these traitors and restore the republic! Westwards!"
 russia.1917.b: "This is Russia, One and Indivisible! We shall smash these traitors!"
 russia.1917.c: "§RPlay as [SOV.GetNameDef]§!"

 russia.1918.t: "Anti-Socialist Coup"
 russia.1918.d: "Despite [ROOT.GetLeader] being made interim president of Russia, the country's vast military apparatus was still dominated by the Whites, who would be at best distrustful of someone of his background. The same could also be said for many civilian officials, as well as the masses of Russians that resented the left. When he failed to restore any semblance of order after the assassination of Kerensky, it was only a matter of time before the government fell apart. [ROOT.GetLeader] was despised by the right from the moment he assumed office, was far too much of a socialist to be considered a compromise candidate by the liberals, and was even unable to rally Russia's left due to the utter paralysis of his administration.\n\nFearing that [ROOT.GetLeader]'s failing government would crumble and give way to a syndicalist takeover, several reactionary officers led by Lavr Kornilov made their move at the crack of dawn. Thanks to widespread treachery within the army, intelligence services and civilian institutions, they were able to seize multiple key government buildings and strategic infrastructure both in the capital and across the country before loyalists could put up any resistance. In a radio address heard from Smolensk all the way to Kamchatka, Kornilov declared that the age of anarchy was over and that the army had once more liberated Russia from the reds.\n\nBy noon, the interim government was no more. [ROOT.GetLeader] was placed under arrest and garrisons in several major cities began rounding up prominent leftist politicians and their supporters. While many Russian conservatives, nationalists and even some liberals were cheering on the developments, others watched in horror as Kornilov brutally destroyed any hope of political reform. No matter how Kornilov acted from here on, few in Russia or abroad considered this the end of the nation's troubles.\n\nFor now, though, Kornilov and his aides had to decide how Russia would be governed. While he feels quite confident in both his ability to rule and in the necessity of a strong hand in such times, advisors close to him insist that he should win the hearts and minds of the Russian people by restoring the senate and announcing elections. The top candidate for the job is Dmitry Romanov, an avid supporter of the counter-revolution and one of Russia's most influential rightist politicians."
 russia.1918.a: "We must not be seen as tyrants this time. Restore the Senate!"
 russia.1918.b: "A firm hand is needed to quell syndicalism. Maintain military rule!"

 russia.1920.t: "Russian Exiles Depart For Moscow"
 russia.1920.d: "When the working men of Britain rose up against the tyranny of the upper class in 1925, many generals of the failed Soviets in Russia offered their services to our fledging rebels. Since the revolution they had pledged their allegiance to Britain and trained our own officers in exchange for safe harbour and to work towards the international cause. But today, Russia calls once more and they now depart to the battlefields of their homelands. After emotional farewells, the exiles have departed for Russia with the blessing and best regards of the whole TUC."
 russia.1920.a: "Godspeed, gentlemen."

 russia.1921.t: "Exiles Arrive From Britain"
 russia.1921.d: "When the British Revolution broke out in 1925, many Bolshevik officers offered their services to the British and since then had resided in the country serving and training the Republican Army. But with our own civil war in full swing, they have returned once more and are ready to help in the fight for a red Russia."
 russia.1921.a: "The revolution fights on."

 russia.1922.t: "The Red Threat"
 russia.1922.d: "Russia has once again fallen into civil war, yet again caused by the socialists. If this revolution ever wins, the Union is doomed - for the good of our nation, we must make common cause with the republicans for the time being."
 russia.1922.a: "We must act."

 russia.1945.t: "Part of the Navy Defects"
 russia.1945.d: "The eruption of the Second Civil War has torn apart units of the Russian navy. Some of them have sworn their loyalty to the new socialist government."
 russia.1945.a: "Our fleet mutinies!"

 russia.1946.t: "Parts of the Russian Navy Defects"
 russia.1946.d: "Ships that were loyal to the rotten capitalist Russian state have now joined us in an effort to bring the ideals of Lenin to the remaining parts of Russia."
 russia.1946.a: "A new Red Navy!"

 russia.1947.t: "The Fall of [653.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 russia.1947.d: "The temporary capital of the rotten Russian state, [653.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], has been captured by the victorious Red Army. We are facing scarce resistance from the civilian population but we will soon take full control of the city."
 russia.1947.a: "It won't be long now!"

 russia.1948.t: "The Fall of [653.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 russia.1948.d: "To the horror of all of Russia, the socialist forces continue to advance, having now crossed the Urals. Despite fierce resistance by our valiant forces, our wartime capital in [653.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has fallen to the victorious Red forces, who are now sweeping into the heart of Siberia. This catastrophe is a serious blow to the anti-socialist cause - already our troops have begun to desert. It seems the end is near for us."
 russia.1948.a: "It's all over..."

 russia.1949.t: "The Revolution Successful"
 russia.1949.d.kornilov: "When Kornilov overthrew Russia's legitimate government he killed Russia's democracy in its infancy and signalled to millions of Russians that a return to autocracy was inevitable. As thousands were marched off to the jails, many more took to the streets to protest. Protests turned into riots, and into a revolution. Gaining widespread popular support against the draconian measures undertaken by the Kornilov junta, the revolutionary ranks quickly swelled. With only the most strident rightists remaining in Kornilov's fold, the hardened and veteran White Army soon found itself pushed back by the vast numbers of the reconstituted Red Army. In the end, with only Siberia to retreat towards, they eventually fragmented. Though holdouts will likely remain past the Urals for quite some time, the White Movement has been thoroughly defeated and stands no chance of reversing its fortunes.\n\nThough the vanguard of the revolution was initially sidelined by more moderate elements that joined up simply to stand up against the prospect of a stratocracy, there's no doubt that this is a victory won by the radical socialists. No matter what path the fledgling Russian Socialist Republic takes after this, she will remain firmly in the socialist bloc for years to come. Indeed, the prospects of a socialist Russia joining forces with the syndicalists in Paris is already keeping many strategists in the Reichspakt up at night."
 russia.1949.d.dmitriy: "When Kornilov overthrew Russia's socialist government, he seemed to be aware of the possible ramifications of assuming power all by himself. As such, he was quick to announce the transition of power from the military to the rightist forces in the Senate. Despite this however, the act of overthrowing what many still saw as Russia's legitimate government served to radicalise millions and sway them towards radical socialism. Made out of a revolutionary vanguard, their revolution spread quickly in the western parts of Russia despite lacking much in the way of widespread popular support at first. As it started to rack up victories against the White Movement, however, the revolutionary vanguard took control over one city after another from the fledgling democracy. In the end, the radical socialists managed to push them into Siberia and once their last major fallback capital fell, the movement evaporated. Though disorganised resistance will likely linger east of the Urals for years to come, the vanguard's victory has been achieved.\n\nMade out of a hardened core of revolutionaries, Russia is now controlled by the most radical socialists in the movement. Whether they'll remain in power or if the socialist republic moves to more orthodox interpretations of syndicalism now that the war is over remains to be seen. Whatever happens, however, Russia will remain firmly in the socialist bloc for years to come. Indeed, the prospects of a communistic Russia joining forces with the syndicalists in Paris is already keeping many strategists in the Reichspakt up at night."
 russia.1949.a: "Death to tyrants! Long live the Revolution!"

 russia.1951.t: "End of the Civil War"
 russia.1951.d.kornilov: "Today marks the end of the Second Russian Civil War, a bloody affair that started as a widespread revolt against what many perceived to be an autocratic overreach by Lavr Kornilov. Though it had widespread popular support at first, that quickly melted away as a resurgent White Movement started to rack up more and more victories against the 'socialist menace'. As the war went on, the Russian Socialist Republic slowly but surely started to lose the soft support it'd once enjoyed from more moderate elements of Russian society that were repulsed by Kornilov's power grab. By the end, only the most ideologically strident socialists remained to hold the torch of revolution against the seemingly unstoppable advances of the White Army.\n\nIn the end, the Second Russian Civil War ended much like the last one had with the defeat of the reds. What's different this time, however, is that there is no Kerensky, no Duma to speak of, not any other person or institution left that can oppose the White Movement. As suspected dissidents and stragglers are rounded up and the last vestiges of socialism are being erased from the few villages that still hold out, there can be no doubt that this is a victory without compromises for the military. International observers all seem to be in unanimous agreement that with the complete eradication of Russia's left and the hollowing out of the centre, the country's almost inevitably going to remain a right-wing autocracy for years to come. Kornilov's vision of a firm hand to protect Russia from Bolshevism has now come to pass."
 russia.1951.d.dmitriy: "Today marks the end of the Second Russian Civil War, a bloody affair that started out as a revolt led by a communist vanguard against a fledgling democracy that failed to get back on its feet after the assassination of Aleksandr Kerensky. Its promises quickly spread in the large cities in the west where years of mismanagement and Kornilov's brief draconian reign had taken their toll, but was eventually stopped dead in its tracks when Dmitry Romanov managed to rally the rest of Russia against the far-left radicals. With most of the nation and the army eventually siding with Dmitry's government over the socialist upstarts, the reds were eventually pushed out of their last few cities with only a few holdouts remaining in the countryside.\n\nIn the end, the Russian civil war ended much like the last one - with the defeat of the socialists and the preservation of a shaky democratic institution still in its infancy. Although initially seen by many as a stooge of the White Army, the government led by [ROOT.GetLeader] is holding true to its promises that democracy will be preserved in Russia and that the people have won their freedom back against a violent revolutionary mob. Be that as it may, no one doubts that with two bloody civil wars fresh within its memory, Russia will likely remain firmly within the rightist camp for years to come."
 russia.1951.a: "No quarter for traitors. No repeats of past mistakes."
 russia.1951.b: "History repeats itself."

 russia.1953.t: "White Terror"
 russia.1953.d: "During the ongoing civil war some of our commanders have started to use rather doubtful methods to permanently suppress the civilian population suspected of helping our mortal enemies. Such policies are a necessary evil in these dark times."
 russia.1953.a: "War is war."

 russia.1954.t: "Red Terror"

 russia.2000.t: "Independence for the Alash Autonomy?"
 russia.2000.d: "Our country, despite nominally being part of Russia with an autonomous status, has been de facto independent since the Minsk treaty in 1920. Despite a Russian attempt in 1925 to fully integrate us into Russia while repelling an invasion from Turkestan, our status has remained unchanged thanks to Admiral Kolchak's coup attempt. Now, with Russia engulfed in chaos, the time has come to throw off the chains of its oppression and end our servitude to our oppressors!"
 russia.2000.a: "No, we must remain loyal to Russia."
 russia.2000.b: "Declare full independence from Russia!"

 russia.2001.t: "The Alash Autonomy declares Independence!"
 russia.2001.d: "Terrible news! Our autonomous region of Alash Orda has decided to use the political chaos in Russia to sever almost all their ties with Russia and declare independence. While many hotheads in the General Staff are demanding immediate action, ongoing chaos prevents us from responding to this treachery. It seems that we must let Alash-Orda be for now..."
 russia.2001.a: "There is nothing we can do..."

 russia.25.t: "Reorganisation of the Internal Police"
 russia.25.d: "As a symbol of Tsarist repression, the Okhrannoye Otdeleniye (Guard Department) was abolished by the Provisional Government on March of 1917, and never restored. In effect, however, secret police practices in the Russian republic never vanished and simply changed form. The White forces in the Russian Civil War operated their own measures against Bolshevik subversion, and several departments were formed under the Ministry of Internal Affairs to fulfil the same purpose, such as the Third Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, or the Gendarmerie. Aleksandr Kerensky's government used these institutions with little hesitation to prevent a second Revolution, the most famous of their actions was the assassination of Tambov revolutionary Aleksandr Antonov.\n\nBy mid 1935, the President was planning to reorganise the internal police and establish the Department for Protecting Order (Otdeleniye po Okhraneniyu Poryadka), which would bear the same name as the Tsarist Okhrana. Though he may have passed, people in our government call to finish his reforms and thus grant us a powerful tool at defending the current order."
 russia.25.a: "A good idea!"

 russia.26.t: "Reforming the Military"
 russia.26.d: "The Armed Forces of the Russian Republic have had a difficult history - it took a decade after the end of the Civil War to restore a stratified, professional army. During the war, it had devolved into cliques of White Generals and their volunteer followers, after all. Still, a lot of work needs to be done before the Russian army can compete with its likely challengers, be it Germany or Japan.\n\nSome see a future in the mobilisation of the Russian masses and predict that the next Weltkrieg will be a total war which will require all of the country's resources dedicated to the front. Others, such as General Sergey Markov, were impressed by the effectiveness of armoured cars, tanks and trains during the Weltkrieg and hope to organise the army around this armoured breakthrough priority. Other officer cliques are more moderate, though their proposals for army reform no less extensive. The ultimate decision lies in your hands, however."
 russia.26.a: "I will have a look."

 russia.184.t: "Reforming the Navy"
 russia.184.d: "Recent naval manoeuvres have led us to one conclusion: the Russian navy is a mess! Sweeping reforms are needed if we are to dominate the seas once more. Each of our top admirals have come up with a plan. Their proposals await the government's consultation."
 russia.184.a: "I will have a look."

 russia.27.t: "Governing Russia"
 russia.27.d.wrangel: "More than a year has passed since our assumption of power and we have bought some measure of stability to the country. However, many believe we need to take greater measures to promote the cause of order. But the question is should we keep our democratic progress or should we bring the political system back to the certainties of the Tsarist era? We could also make Wrangel the permanent leader of Russia."
 russia.27.d.dmitriy: "Grand Duke Dmitry has been president for more than a year now and his time in office has been a great success. The people are once again becoming accustomed to the rule by their social betters and now could be the perfect time to restore the Tsarist system. But who should be Tsar, Dmitry or the legitimate Tsar Kirill? Or maybe we should maintain the republic of aristocrats."
 russia.27.d.republic: "More than a year has passed since our assumption of power and we have brought some measure of stability to the country. Changes to our political system could bring even more stability, or maybe not - the Republic seems fine as it is."
 russia.27.a: "The decision is yours."

### Domestic Events ###

 rusd.1.t: "Political Bombings"
 rusd.1.d: "The Anarchists, Socialists, Syndicalists and Bolsheviks are weakening the stability of our Motherland. Recently, one of them assassinated an army officer. God only knows who they will kill next time!"
 rusd.1.a: "I want the head of the bomber on my desk!"

 rusd.3.t: "Failure of a Bombing Plot"
 rusd.3.d: "The Anarchists, Socialists, Syndicalists and Bolsheviks are weakening the stability of our Motherland. Recently, they caused a panic in one of the major Russian cities when an assassin tried to kill a famous government representative. Thankfully the bomb went off too early, killing only a few people."

 rusd.4.t: "Peasant Unrest"
 rusd.4.d: "Throughout Russian history the peasants' living conditions has always been hard, even during periods of peace and prosperity. Even the emancipation reforms of 1861, which led to the abolition of serfdom, did not improve the situation all that much. Local peasant protests against their grim position, as well as landowners' illegal actions, were common."
 rusd.4.a: "Oh well..."

 rusd.5.t: "Agitation in the Countryside"
 rusd.5.d: "With the situation in the countryside growing increasingly unstable, the peasants are becoming easy to influence, with various agitators taking advantage of the unrest. One such situation has recently taken place; a charismatic activist visited a number of villages calling for open revolt against our regime. How should we react to this potential threat?"
 rusd.5.a: "Let him agitate, we have more important business."
 rusd.5.b: "Eliminate the agitator!"

 rusd.6.t: "Major Peasant Unrest"
 rusd.6.d: "Agitated by various groups, the impoverished peasantry has risen up. The local administration is powerless against the mob and it seems that the only way to solve the crisis is to use force. Alternatively we can always attempt to negotiate, although satisfying the peasants' demands may turn out to be quite expensive."
 rusd.6.a: "Send the army to eliminate the threat!"
 rusd.6.b: "Attempt to negotiate and fulfil some of their demands."
 rusd.6.c: "Fully agree to the peasants' demands."

 rusd.7.t: "Workers' Demonstrations"
 rusd.7.d: "Even though technological advancement resulted in a slow but steady improvement of working conditions, the workers remained very vulnerable to Socialist agitation. Demonstrations in cities were organised from time to time, their demands varying depending on who was pulling the strings."
 rusd.7.a: "Oh well..."

 rusd.8.t: "Workers' Strike"
 rusd.8.d: "Some workers in one of our cities have organised themselves and began to strike, completely disrupting all industrial production within the city. They demand higher salaries and enforcement of labour regulations preventing unfair treatment of the workforce."
 rusd.8.a: "Fulfil their demands."
 rusd.8.b: "Ignore their demands."
 rusd.8.c: "Send in the army to pacify them!"

 rusd.9.t: "Negotiating with the Strikers"
 rusd.9.d: "An attempt to negotiate with the striking workers has been made. All political forces in the country closely watch the meeting, and some are hoping that the strike will become an impulse for further reforms in Russia."
 rusd.9.a: "Stall the negotiations."
 rusd.9.b: "Reach an agreement, but keep the reforms to a minimum."
 rusd.9.c: "Reach a thorough agreement."

 rusd.10.t: "Harsh Measures"
 rusd.10.d: "The commander of a local army garrison has proposed that we use brute force in order to disperse the strikers and force them to go back to work."
 rusd.10.a: "Why not? It's quicker than those negotiations!"
 rusd.10.b: "No, we must not be too harsh."

 rusd.11.t: "The Strikers Give Up!"
 rusd.11.d: "The slow war of attrition between us and the strikers has been won by the government. The workers, seeing little success in their efforts, are about to call off the strike."
 rusd.11.a: "Splendid!"

 rusd.12.t: "The Workers Return to the Factories"
 rusd.12.d: "With the crisis resolved, the factories may return to their previous efficiency."
 rusd.12.a: "Excellent!"

 rusd.13.t: "General Strike"
 rusd.13.d: "Workers organisations all over Russia have reached an agreement and decided to call for a general strike. Even though the response to their initiative has been rather limited so far, it is very possible that more and more workers will join the strike, should the situation continue to deteriorate."
 rusd.13.a: "Damned Socialists!"

 rusd.14.t: "General Strike Expands"
 rusd.14.d: "Workers from other factories have joined the general strike. The situation is on the brink of eruption."
 rusd.14.a: "We must be prepared for the worst!"

 rusd.15.t: "Clashes with the Workers"
 rusd.15.d: "Workers from other factories have joined the general strike. The situation is on the brink of eruption."
 rusd.15.a: "Send in the army!"

 rusd.16.t: "Clashes in [RUS_clashes_state.GetName]"
 rusd.16.d: "Workers in [RUS_clashes_state.GetName] have organised a militia and have attacked our troops!"
 rusd.16.a: "Damn!"

 rusd.38.t: "Status of the Orthodox Church"
 rusd.38.d: "Article 5 of the Constitution of the Russian Republic states that 'Russia is henceforth a state in which no faith or belief can have privileges and rights which other faiths do not share, and religion does not have a say in government'. For a country which, up to that point, was built upon the Russian Orthodox Church, this was a rather shocking change in policy which many people could not agree with. In 1927, the Church saw a new Patriarch rise - Kirill, who has since been vehement in his crusade to amend the Fifth Article and grant the Church a prestigious status in the Russian republic. Now that Kerensky is gone and new people are in charge, he has officially petitioned the government to amend the Constitution and elevate the Church to the status of a state religion."
 rusd.38.a: "Repeal Article 5."
 rusd.38.b: "Russia shall stay secular!"

 rusd.39.t: "The Clergy Criticises Our Government"
 rusd.39.d: "A number of priests have voiced their disagreement with our policy of a secular and modern state. Even though this fact has little importance, we must keep in mind that religion plays a huge role in common people's lives."
 rusd.39.a: "Progress cannot be stopped!"

 rusd.40.t: "The Patriarch Criticises Our Government"
 rusd.40.d: "Seeing increased displeasure among the common people, the patriarch has decided to voice his concern about the increasing secularisation of our state. Even if we try to turn a deaf ear on the clergy's demands, we cannot easily ignore a character so influential and powerful such as the patriarch."
 rusd.40.a: "Everything shall stay as it is!"
 rusd.40.b: "Encourage a national debate on religious matters."
 rusd.40.c: "He is right, declare Orthodoxy our state religion!"

 rusd.44.t: "Mass for the Motherland"
 rusd.44.d.secular: "Despite our secular politics there are still some religious elements within the country that wish well for its future, no matter who is in charge of the government. Yesterday a small mass was dedicated to the prosperity of our motherland."
 rusd.44.d.orthodox: "A small celebration dedicated to the prosperity of our Motherland has been performed yesterday in one of our towns. Even though it was very modest in scale and attendance, it attracted the conservative media's attention. Many common people consider this to be a visible sign of the Church's support for the Motherland."
 rusd.44.a: "A harmless, yet useful ceremony!"
 rusd.44.b: "S nami Bog!"

 rusd.46.t.not_monarchy: "Mass for the Motherland"
 rusd.46.d.not_monarchy: "A large scale celebration has taken place in our capital. Apart from thousands of common Russians, the Patriarch, members of the Romanov family and dozens of nobles, politicians and high-ranking officers have attended the mass. This is a great occasion to underline the ties between the government and the Church in these uncertain times."
 rusd.46.a: "S nami Bog!"

 rusd.46.t.monarchy: "Prayers for the Tsar"
 rusd.46.d.monarchy: "A mass dedicated to our beloved ruler has been organised in the capital. The Patriarch has officially invited the Tsar and members of his family to take part in the ceremony."
 rusd.46.b: "Bozhe, Tsarya khrani!"

 rusd.48.t: "The Liberals Criticise the Clergy"
 rusd.48.d: "It seems that the liberal elements of our society consider it rather unwise to maintain such strong bonds between the Church and the state. During a small demonstration in the capital, they have demanded more religious pluralism and secularisation of the government."
 rusd.48.a: "Let them shout!"

 rusd.49.t: "Unrest Among the Military"
 rusd.49.d: "The election of Shlyapnikov to the position of interim president seems to have caused negative repercussions. Much of the top military leadership have vocally spoke out against his premiership and it is alleged that privately, those generals both vocal and quiet of the situation have signalled that they would not intervene were the president to be deposed. Among the lower levels of the military there has been great unrest with reactionary agitation whipping the soldiers into an unruly frenzy."
 rusd.49.a: "Worrying."

 rusd.50.t: "[Root.GetLeader] Addresses the Nation"
 rusd.50.d: "The country remains in chaos after the assassination of President Kerensky. Though Moscow and Petrograd may finally be secure, the countryside continues to receive conflicting messages and reports. Generals in the army are considering mutinies or even marching onto the capital in order to restore order. To restore the government's control over the apparatus of the state, Acting President [Root.GetLeader] took to the radio waves.\n\nIn a twenty minute long speech, the Acting President explained the situation to the full extent of the Duma's knowledge - that an assailant of unknown motive has shot the President and left the country without a head of state. A coalition of democratically inclined parties in the State Duma have banded together to maintain stability and elect an Acting President until the Elections of 1937. In the meantime, however, [Root.GetLeader] promises to maintain the civil rights and liberties of the Republic's citizens and prevent a decay of order."
 rusd.50.a: "Democracy in Russia shall prevail!"

 rusd.51.t: "Marshal Wrangel Addresses the Nation"
 rusd.51.d: "Field Marshal Pyotr Wrangel and his regiment entered Moscow with almost machine-like precision. Order across the city was swiftly restored, strikes and demonstrations were broken up, but no needless violence was reported. The Black Baron himself ordered his units to maintain peace and no more. Surrounded by the army, the Duma and the Senate had no choice but to give in to Wrangel's orders, even if it meant that a quarter of the representatives resigned in disgust. Elected Acting President, he immediately activated Article 48 of the Constitution to grant himself emergency powers and suspend civil liberties in the name of public order.\n\nA few hours later, he took to the radio waves, informing the startled Russian people of exactly what had just happened, and explained that though this was a difficult decision for him, a military man first and foremost, he could not stand by and watch his beloved nation decay. A coalition of right-wing representatives and senators have chosen to openly endorse Wrangel's government, and form the base of his support."
 rusd.51.a: "The Black Baron shall bring order to holy Russia!"

 rusd.56.t.tsar: "The Tsar Is Dead!"
 rusd.56.d.tsar: "His Royal Highness, Kirill Romanov, Tsar and Autocrat of All the Russias, has died less than two years after the Restoration! Thankfully, the line of succession is now clear; his young son Vladimir shall be crowned as the new Tsar."
 rusd.56.a: "Long live the Tsar, ordained by the Wisdom of God!"
 rusd.56.b: "Long live the Tsar, raised high by the Will of the People!"

 rusd.56.t.other: "Kirill Romanov Is Dead"
 rusd.56.d.other: "The recognised legitimate candidate to the Russian throne, Kirill Romanov, has died today. His son Vladimir is now the main Romanov pretender to the throne."
 rusd.56.c: "Farewell, Kirill Vladimirovich!"
 rusd.56.d: "Good riddance to another Romanov."

 rusd.56.d.wrangel: "The Romanov pretender, Kirill Romanov, has died. His son Vladimir is in his early twenties and may make an excellent and pliable figurehead as Tsar. Perhaps now it is time to restore the Monarchy?"
 rusd.56.e: "Yes, a new Tsar shall promote order and stability!"
 rusd.56.f: "No, the time of the Tsars is over."

 rusd.57.t: "The Investment Debate"
 rusd.57.d: "The ability to help fund the Zemstva institutions is a double-edged sword. As it stands, the Zemstva only invest money they gain from local taxes, and if something happens, the government in [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] can always pin the blame on the local governor and have him replaced, without mentioning the advantages inherent in such a localised form of management. On the other hand, this does limit the scope of what they can achieve. The moment we step in, however, the government in [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] will be held responsible for anything that fails.\n\nFor this reason, some are recommending cautious - if any - investments on our part. While some cite the need to not get involved in every minor issue in every Siberian hamlet, more market-oriented ministers cite that the Zemstva have largely been doing just fine without our direct intervention and that the state should allow the local governance to function as intended. Other ministers, however, prefer a more direct approach by the government and insist that we can't let a handful of irresponsible career politicians blind us to the potential benefits we could reap by providing state funding to the Zemstva."
 rusd.57.a: "Keep it small."
 rusd.57.b: "Give them increased funding."
 rusd.57.c: "Make a large investment."

 rusd.58.t: "Direction of Investment"
 rusd.58.d: "As we help expand the Zemstva institutions, new investment opportunities have opened up. Now we must decide where and how to direct our investments, in order to maximise their impact."
 rusd.58.a: "Focus on bureaucratic matters."
 rusd.58.b: "Fund industrial development of the region."
 rusd.58.c: "Invest in local research facilities."

 rusd.59.t.hospital: "Healthcare Expansion"
 rusd.59.d.hospital: "Today marked the opening of a new hospital in [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName]. As the more localised form of government under the Zemstva allows for local leaders to react more quickly and precisely to the needs of the local citizenry, the new hospital marks a fast response to what could otherwise have turned into a regional health crisis in the wake of our rapid growth. As living standards improve, so too will satisfaction with our government."

 rusd.59.t.schools: "New Schools Opened"
 rusd.59.d.schools: "Thanks to well-placed investments in [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName], the state has seen a remarkable up-tick in schools built and teachers being trained. The rapid improvements being made to the education system has led to a marked improvement in the quality of life for the locals. Another success for the Zemstva is another success for the government as well."

 rusd.59.t.housing: "Zemstva Housing Programme"
 rusd.59.d.housing: "A housing programme initiated by the local Zemstva in [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName] has yielded positive results so far. Already we're seeing reports that homelessness is at a record low. As people's lives improve, so too will their patriotism. After all, fighting for their land is an easier sell when their government makes sure they have a roof over their heads."

 rusd.59.t.civilian_industry_1: "Industrial Expansion"
 rusd.59.d.civilian_industry_1: "With a Zemstva consisting of many wealthy industrialists, [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName] has seen considerable investments into building new factories in the region. These newly expanded industrial concerns have proved a boon to the local economy, and the expansion of industry in the region will inevitably be a boon to the state as well."

 rusd.59.t.civilian_industry_2: "Economic Development"
 rusd.59.d.civilian_industry_2: "The Zemstva in [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName] and [RUS_zemstvo_state_2.GetName] have pooled their resources and expertise together and embarked on a major economic stimulus plan for the region. Millions of rubles have poured into local companies and the large up-tick in economic activity has acted like a magnet for outside investments as well. Stores and factories have opened in several cities and new railroads are bringing goods from one end of the region to store shelves across Russia. Naturally, these riches will inevitably trickle their way upstream to [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as well."

 rusd.59.t.military_industry: "Increased Arms Production"
 rusd.59.d.military_industry: "Investments by the local merchants in modernising production methods in [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName] have recently resulted in a large up-tick in productivity. With goods filling store shelves at record speeds, we should also count ourselves lucky that the benefits of these investments are trickling down to many of our state-run companies as well. More civilian goods are nice, but we're equally concerned with the more pressing matters of state defence."

 rusd.59.t.civilian_industry_3: "Large Industrial Expansion"
 rusd.59.d.civilian_industry_3: "[RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName], [RUS_zemstvo_state_2.GetName] and [RUS_zemstvo_state_3.GetName] have been epicentres of what can best be described as a localised industrial revolution. A good investment climate, an abundance of expertise and a visionary ruling class has led to the gradual establishment of a new industrial concern in these regions. Thousands of people now find themselves employed on these factory floors and goods are being produced at an astonishing rate. This is clearly a great success for our economic policies!"

 rusd.59.t.infrastructure: "Infrastructural Improvements"
 rusd.59.d.infrastructure: "A local governor in [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName], appalled by the poor state of the roads in the region, has paid for the construction of new ones out of his own pocket. Over the past several weeks, labourers have put their shovels into the ground and helped to improve our infrastructure. The local papers may be praising his efforts, but it's ultimately the government in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] that reap the benefits of this act of generosity."

 rusd.59.t.agriculture: "Increased Crop Yields"
 rusd.59.d.agriculture: "New agricultural initiatives in [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName] have recently led to a large bumper crop this year! Store shelves are full and so are the bank accounts of the farmers! Of course, one way or another, a lot of the benefits of this abundant yield will trickle back to us in due time."

 rusd.59.t.synthetics: "Breakthrough in Synthetic Oil"
 rusd.59.d.synthetics: "It'd seem that the recent spending increases towards the Zemstva has yielded a tremendous breakthrough! [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName] report that they've established a synthetic plant, adding a healthy production to its fuel and rubber production. This will help keep the region's population more self-sufficient, and is already yielding large export profits. Naturally, this development is quite pleasing to our military industrial complex as well..."

 rusd.59.t.failure_1: "Mismanagement Plagues a Zemstvo"
 rusd.59.d.failure_1: "While more decentralised rule has its benefits, the lack of government oversight can sometimes have a negative side as well. We've recently been informed that many factories and companies in [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName] are poorly run due to gross mismanagement, a situation that unfortunately has flown under the radar for longer than it ought to have. While the governor of the region has stepped in to remedy matters, we're nonetheless left paying the price for not being able to stop this widespread neglect sooner."

 rusd.59.t.failure_2: "Zemstvo Embroiled in Embezzlement Scandal"
 rusd.59.d.failure_2: "Though our laissez-faire approach to economic matters has been a great boon to the economy, the lack of oversight means that sometimes the wealth being generated ends up in the pockets of crooks. [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName] recently experienced this first-hand when a group of wealthy merchants used their wealth to buy their way into attaining considerable influence over the local Zemstva. With little oversight, they were able to embezzle a good deal of money meant to go to the state's coffers before law enforcement managed to shut their operation down. As their findings seem to indicate that this is merely the tip of the iceberg, however, it seems like we'll be battling this kind of corruption for the foreseeable future..."

 rusd.59.t.failure_3: "A Zemstvo Needs a Bailout!"
 rusd.59.d.failure_3: "A string of failed investments and poor planning has led to several key companies involved in a Zemstva project going so far down into the red that we have no choice but to provide them with a government bailout to keep their projects from utterly falling apart. We'll just have to bite the bullet on this one, tighten our belts, pay up, and tighten our belts in the coming months ahead. Needless to say, the governor that greenlit this will have some explaining to do..."

 rusd.59.d.industrial_research: "Our bright minds in the research staff in [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName] are reporting that they've made significant advances in their civilian engineering research. Leading the way with new patented inventions, their efforts will make work easier for our research teams across the country."

 rusd.59.d.industrial_research_bonus: "Splendid news!

Their research breakthrough has likely spared us months of additional hard work researching and developing. We're ready to start testing right away!"

 rusd.59.t.industrial_research_failure: "Industrial Research Set Back!"
 rusd.59.d.industrial_research_failure: "Our researchers in [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName] are reporting a major setback. The professors in the employ of the Zemstva made a dire miscalculation in their assessments and it turns out (unfortunately only after extensive testing) that a lot of their hard work was based on a faulty premise. Unfortunately, some of our state-run research teams had used their work as a basis for their own projects as well, meaning that we're likely to see an overall slowdown of our research efforts in the months ahead."

 rusd.59.t.military_research_failure: "Military Research Set Back!"
 rusd.59.d.military_research_failure: "Terrible news! Smoke billowed out of the main research centre in [RUS_zemstvo_state_1.GetName] today as their tests... Well, quite literally blew up in their faces. Although no one's injured, we've learned the hard way that there are no shortcuts when it comes to putting out even bigger guns for our military to use. As it stands, research will be slowed down while we work on renovating and rebuilding their damaged facilities."

 rusd.59.a: "Excellent."

 rusd.61.t: "The Russian Elections of [GetYear]"
 rusd.61.d.republic_1937: "According to the Constitution of 1922, elections to the both houses of Parliament are to be held every five years. The legislature then appoints a President and the Council of Ministers. Although Kerensky's assassination caused major turmoil in Russia, democracy has managed to wait out the storm and elections can proceed without interruption.\n\nThe Republican period has seen the party system in Russia settle down into two main poles.

 rusd.66.t: "Chernov and Tsereteli Break"
 rusd.66.d: "For the longest time, the Social Democratic Labour, still called the \"Mensheviks\" despite their Bolshevik counterparts having long since vanished to history, were the primary source of opposition to Kerensky's regime from the left. Its leader, Irakliy Tsereteli, failed to take advantage of all of the party's potential, however, mostly because he refused to - vehemently opposed to petty politicking, backstabbing and manipulation, he was one of the few political leaders in Russia truly guided by ideals rather than pragmatism. On the other side stood Viktor Chernov, who was once an idealist like Tsereteli, but twenty years after the Constituent Assembly have left him a changed man, and he had since become the political machine behind Kerensky'd endless presidency.\n\nThe January events pushed the two leaders closer to one another, forming a plural left alliance between them, but it was not to last. After several months of cooperation, the Mensheviks have finally broken with their Socialist-Revolutionary allies. This has once again left the Russian left splintered. The Mensheviks are taking a turn towards the left, courting the Syndicalist-influenced extremists, who, to Tsereteli, are better than the SRs, whereas Chernov has once again made his way to the Kadet benches to negotiate an alliance."

 rusd.106.t: "Maxim Gorky Dies"
 rusd.106.d: "Russian writer Aleksey Maximovich Peshkov, better known under his pen name Maxim Gorky, died today in Moscow at 68. A fellow traveller of the Bolsheviks, he experienced oppression under the Tsarist regime but was quite doubtful during the October Revolution, thus avoiding reprisals after the Civil War. A rabid opponent of Kerensky, he publicly supported Bukharin. As he narrowly followed his son in death many think that his sudden death could be due to the changing political atmosphere in Russia."

 rusd.122.t: "The Kurchatov Petition"
 rusd.122.d: "Particle physicists have achieved many breakthroughs in Russia in the 1930s. Spearheaded by scientists such as Igor Kurchatov, Abram Alikhanov, Georgy Flyorov and others, our experimental research institutes have formed a sound theory on the potential held by nuclear fission. They were not the only ones, however. It is no secret that nuclear physicists in Germany and the Third Internationale have been delving into the potential of nuclear power as well, and all of them have come to the same conclusion - that it can be weaponised.\n\nIgor Kurchatov and several other Russian nuclear physicists have collectively signed a petition and presented it to [Root.GetLeader], where they have rung alarm bells. Kurchatov informs that foreign scientific journals have ceased any and all publications about nuclear research, even the most mundane reports, which can only mean that it has become confidential information and Russia's enemies must be actively developing nuclear armament. The only answer is to create a dedicated Russian nuclear weapons programme - a request which Kurchatov and his peers have been granted. Under [Root.GetLeader]'s personal orders, new facilities have been opened deep in Central Siberia for the RDS-1 project - "Reaktivny Spetsialny Dvigatel" (Reactive Special Engine), which shall recruit Russia's brightest to develop a weapon with the power to manifest Apocalypse on Earth."

Now, with a war against Savinkov's despised socialists at hand, the former terrorist is at our doorstep, offering his support. He promises that he will be able to bring us forty thousand armed volunteers in a matter of days, and though most of them may not be trained soldiers, their support in this war would be invaluable. Of course, it will also not be free."

Widely claimed to be Boris Savinkov's favourite movie, this classic musical comedy is a must-see. It centres on a group of amateur performers on their way to Moscow to perform in a talent contest called the Moscow Musical Olympiad. Most of the action takes place on a steamboat travelling on the Volga River."
 rusd.124.a: "Funny enough to make the Vozhd smile!"

 rusd.125.t: "Bastion of Democracy"
 rusd.125.d: "Maintenance of the democratic regime combined with the stable development of the state led to the emigration of some celebrities from syndicalist countries to Russia. This led, for example, to the arrival in Russia of the good friend of Dmitry Pavlovich, Coco Chanel. That mademoiselle Chanel has chosen to open her office in a village near Tula shows that Russia is a Bastion of Democracy, where everyone can run his or her business without difficulties from the government."
 rusd.125.a: "Glamour in his democracy!"

 rusd.126.t: "Churchill's Iron Curtain Speech"
 rusd.126.d: "Germany's defeat at the hands of combined French and Russian arms six months ago has sent shockwaves across the world, and it has become apparent that this \"Second Weltkrieg\" has changed the face of Europe for years to come. The continent has been divided between the Third Internationale and the Russian bloc, both of which wield enormous forces and have a bone to pick with the other side. And yet, neither of them have chosen to strike first, leaving the continent split in twain.\n\nThe Petrograd University in Russia has had the honour of hosting Sir Winston Churchill, a noted British statesman, writer, and former First Lord of the Admiralty of Britain. Speaking to the attending students, Churchill first made sure to note the great sacrifices which the Russian nation has made during the Second Weltkrieg, and assured that the British Empire and Russia shall always be natural allies in this new world order. The politician described Europe as a continent divided between two fundamentally different forces - one of liberty and one of Syndicalist terror, one of good and one of evil, and that an Iron Curtain divides them. He expresses his dismay that so much of Europe's heritage and famous cities now lie in the "French sphere", and hope that Russia and the Commonwealth can unite against this revolutionary threat.\n\nThough Churchill was not the first to express this idea, the striking imagery of his speech have set a new checkpoint in history. Europe, and with it, the world have been divided in a frozen conflict, one of ideological strife rather than power balance. It may only be solved via subversion, arms race and diplomacy... or a conflict far more destructive than the Second Weltkrieg."

 rusd.128.t: "First Women's Division of Death"
 rusd.128.d: "Maria Bochkareva, Colonel of the Russian Army and Hero of the Weltkrieg and Russian Civil War has recently requested government to allow formation of the first women division by combining existing women's battalions of death which should later serve as basis for formation of a women's corps. Accepting this proposal will surely boost the strength of our army and give significant propaganda value - but conservative elements in our armed forces, unwilling to change the status quo, have to be taken into consideration as well..."

 rusd.130.a: "Three hoorays for our caring Tsar!"

 rusd.131.t: "A Plot Against Russia"
 rusd.131.d: "Maria Spiridonova's death was a severe blow to the Left SR, but many enemies of Savinkov's regime remain. As time passed, the Vozhd has turned increasingly paranoid that he will go the way of the tyrants his younger self eliminated with a bomb in his hand, and to ease this paranoia, the National Republican Party has put a plan into action. Russian newspapers have increasingly begun to speak of a 'plot against Russia', orchestrated by Syndicalists and socialists in cahoots with Germany and the other powers. Numerous high ranking public figures such as Dmitry Merezhovskiy and Dmitry Romanov have published their own articles in which they assert that some "bloodletting" is necessary to restore stability in Russia.\n\nUnder the organisation of Okhrana, a wave of mass crackdowns on suspected political opponents has begun. The Okhrana has been given extraordinary powers to search homes and arrest dissidents without the approval of any judicial institution, several notable leftist politicians and publicists have disappeared off the face of Russia outright. While some are given show trials, others, especially the rank and file of the SR, Mensheviks and Syndicalist parties, are summarily executed or deported. Savinkov has personally presided over several of the show trials, especially those for his old comrades in the Socialist Revolutionaries. In private, to Merezhovskiy, he has remarked how much of a catharsis it is to see the Okhrana, the police he used to flee from and fear three decades ago, now bow to his every whim."
 rusd.131.a: "All enemies of the Nation will be stopped."

 rusd.132.t: "All-Russian Nation"

Will we leave them in trouble? Never. Will we save them? Yes, because we cannot abandon our brothers and sisters. We are the Phoenix that was destroyed and yet reborn. Wait for us - we will come.\" - millions of Russians would hear today on their radios, declared by several energetic speakers under the state propaganda services. The NRPR always decreed irredentism as their primary goal in foreign policy and they were going to live up to their promises.\n\nThough Savinkov's expansionist plans cannot be realised right now, this declaration of common blood and common struggle shows that Russia won't avoid confrontation with the German Empire anymore."
 rusd.132.a: "One nation, one country, one Russia."

 rusd.133.t: "National Rebirth"
 rusd.133.d: "Though Savinkov has never been much of a public speaker, his National Republican Party has always been one of spectacle politics, and their growth in power has only made this more visible. Mass rallies of NRPR members are held across the country, hundreds of thousands attending and flooding the streets to intimidate political opponents with this display of popular might. Armed members of the Combat Squads, Savinkov's personal paramilitary, maintain order - their black uniforms, modelled after the Kornilov Regiment from the Civil War era, make them easily stand out from the crowd. The speakers in these rallies vary in their topics and invoked themes, but a few of them are shared - Russia's impending national rebirth and return to greatness, the complete reformation of the state, and the role of two living giants in seeing this through - Lavr Kornilov and Boris Savinkov.\n\nStarting with "The Pale Horse", Savinkov has consistently invoked the theme of "national rebirth" in his literature. Borrowing the original concept from Russian Symbolists, such as Dmitry Merezhkovskiy, he asserts that a new, stronger Russia will be born through pain and suffering, and this third Russia, neither Tsarist nor democratic, will be able to assert its rightful place among the Great Powers. Though Savinkov has never personally used the term, his emphasis on nationality, national unity, and the power of the masses, the populus, to restore national glory, got the intellectual Nikolay Trubetskoy to dub it "National Populism" (Natsionalniy populizm). When he coined the term in the 1920s, Trubetskoy meant it in a negative light, implying that it is little more than populistic slogans, but it has since become popular, even among parties outside of Russia who try to imitate the NRPR."
 rusd.133.a: "Russia for the Russians!"

 rusd.134.t: "VDNKh"
 rusd.134.d: "Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy (\"Vystavka Dostizheniy Narodnogo Khozyaystva\" or VDNKh) is one of the most ambitious projects of the new government. Forgotten and unremarkable wasteland in the North-East suburbs of Moscow was turned into an ideal model of the future of Russia. Facades of the pavilions of the Russian regions showed the strategic meeting of architectural traditions with the arts and crafts of each part of the country together with motives of important collective labour. Moreover, this exhibition is used by the government to help the farmers to establish contacts between them and the new regime and also to conclude long-term contracts with the Republic."
 rusd.134.a: "That's how we will rebuild Russia."

 rusd.135.t: "Supreme Privy Council"
 rusd.135.d: "Though Savinkov and Kornilov have established a dictatorship, disputes between Savinkov's NRPR republicans and Kornilov's young officers can still endanger the cooperation of these two sides of the new regime. It is obvious that the government can't allow the left radicals in the State Duma and the monarchists in the Senate to use these controversies to destroy the rule of the army and the NRPR. To prevent such unwanted events, Savinkov has proposed a recreation of the Supreme Privy Council ('Verkhovnyi Tainyi Sovet'), which once had both executive and legislative power and consisted of a small number of the most important Russian ministers. Membership of the SPC, known as "Verkhovniki", will consist of 3 party members with Savinkov on top along with Kornilov and 3 of his old comrades from the Russian Army. The Council will be able to issue executive orders, which will have superiority over Russian law."
 rusd.135.a: "History repeats itself."

 rusd.136.t: "Feliks Yusupov and the SPC"
 rusd.136.d: "The richest man of Russia, well-known aristocrat Feliks Yusupov has always wanted to take part in the political life of Russia, but even using his money he could get only a small group of the supporters in the Senate and State Duma. With the creation of the SPC Yusupov has finally understood how he can get one of the highest posts in the Russian Republic. Yusupov has proposed to create the united civil and military engineering organisation with him on the top, which will use Yusupov's money as a start-up capital. But in exchange for this necessary investment for our country, Feliks asks us to make him the new 'Verkhovnik'."
 rusd.136.a: "Feliks, you are the new member of the SPC!"
 rusd.136.b: "There won't be any nobles in the Council!"

 rusd.137.t: "Yusupov's Corporation and Foreign Investors"
 rusd.137.d: "It turned out that using special executive orders of the SPC, Yusupov has seized some foreign factories, which he has included in his monopoly. Though these factories were de-facto stolen from the Russian owners after the end of the Civil war by the foreigners, who didn't pay all taxes during the last decade, anyway they invested some money and now we should give them compensation."
 rusd.137.a: "Feliks, you have to warn us!"

 rusd.138.t: "Savinkov's Address to the Nation."
 rusd.138.d: "Boris Savinkov, the closest associate of Supreme Ruler Kornilov, in his radio address to the Russian people announced his dedication to defending Russia from external and internal enemies, who would try to take control over the country. He promised to deal with corruption inside the state apparatus, conduct land reform, improve labour legislation and provide further recovery of the state. It seems that order has finally returned to the country."
 rusd.138.a: "Finally..."

 rusd.139.t: "Reforming the Senate"
 rusd.139.d: "The recent political crisis has shown the need for extensive reform of the governmental apparatus. The Senate is a useless talking shop, many officials are corrupt and local authorities conceal the real situation in their regions. All these problems should be solved as soon as possible. Our plan outlines creation of a power vertical, the Senate's powers will be restricted and a special control commission will be organised and integrated in the state apparatus."
 rusd.139.a: "The new Senate will represent the new Russia!"

 rusd.140.t: "Noviyi Kurs"
 rusd.140.d: "Almost immediately upon assuming power as President, Dmitry Romanov began looking into all the ways he could possibly expand his power while remaining in the trappings of the Constitution. The document has got enough errors that it did not take a long time - soon, the President appeared before the Duma again, this time to announce his "New Course" (Noviyi Kurs). Under this reform programme to the Constitution, the powers of the State Duma have been limited for an indefinite duration of time, and while they remain the main legislative organ in the state, they now have to share their powers with the Senate, which has received the power of legislative initiative, as well as the ability to promulgate executive orders bypassing the Duma outright. As the Senate is far more loyal to the new president than the Duma ever was, it means that Dmitry has gained a powerful tool at his disposal in order to reform the state to his whim."
 rusd.140.a: "Let it be."

 rusd.141.t: "Elite Gymnasiums"
 rusd.141.d: "Each city in the Russian Empire used to have a gymnasium, where the smartest children and the children of the local elite studied. With the republican reforms of Kerensky most of these schools were cancelled and all these students had to study together with the sons and daughters of the workers and peasants. The Senators claim that such elite gymnasiums should be restored to be sure that the best representatives of the next Russian generation will have perfect conditions for study. Otherwise we can support the public schools, though it is clear that they will never reach the level of the old gymnasiums…"
 rusd.141.a: "Elite gymnasiums for the smartest children!"
 rusd.141.b: "Public schools for everyone!"

 rusd.142.t: "Tradition of the Masquerade balls"
 rusd.142.d: "Masquerade balls were widespread among the Russian nobles and students before the revolution in 1917. With the opening of the new gymnasiums the old tradition was reborn and became very popular and attractive for the students all over the Russian cities and towns, where the Gymnasiums were founded. What is really surprising is that even some students from the public school try to take part in these balls, using the masks. Let's hope that this nice tradition won't disappear in the future."
 rusd.142.a: "This youth is beautiful as Russia itself."

 rusd.143.t: "Mansions of the Aristocrats"
 rusd.143.d: "The richest people of Russia, who are partially represented in the Senate could take back some of their mansions after the awful land redistribution in the Civil war, but they suffered a lot from the high land taxes of the Kerensky's regime. Though these taxes are really profitable for our economy, the loyalty of the Senators are highly important for the realisation of the policies of Dmitry Pavlovich. There is a possible solution to this problem - the mansions of some senators can be secured by the Republic as historical heritage - it means that the Senators will pay the taxes, but the government will partially invest into the maintenance of these buildings."
 rusd.143.a: "Let's hope nobody will notice this reform."
 rusd.143.b: "The senators have enough money, they don't need state investments!"

 rusd.144.t: "Union of Nikolay II"
 rusd.144.d: "\"Union of the perpetuation of the legacy of Nikolay II\" or just \"Union of Nikolay II\" is an organisation, founded by the former tsarist officials such as Pyotr Bark and Vladimir Kokovtsov, who want to keep the remembrance of the last Russian tsar and his policy. They have proposed a programme of the events to show the role of Nikolay II for the Russian people all over the country. The Senate pointed out that we should support this union to establish close connections with the former, but powerful officials. It should allow us to gain some votes of the conservative members of the local and state Dumas."
 rusd.144.a: "We will remember Nikolay for all his good deeds for Russia."
 rusd.144.b: "Many people are still republicans - we won't support the Union."

 rusd.145.t: "Day of Triumph"
 rusd.145.d: "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov, who is the Head of the Senate could finally stop the lasting crisis, which weakened Russia. The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, but also doesn't forget to analyse various propositions of the Senate became the real leader of the Russians and got many new allies even in the State Duma. That's why the Senate unanimously decided to give Dmitry Romanov the broad powers, which even the last tsar Nikolay II and president Kerensky didn't have. Nothing can stop the Duke from the modernisation of Russia, which will allow the republic to take its place under the Sun!"
 rusd.145.a: "Long live Dmitry Pavlovich!"

 rusd.146.t: "Endless Deadlock"
 rusd.146.d: "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov on the top of the Senate unfortunately couldn't stop the lasting crisis, which weakens Russia. The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, paid no attention to the ideas of this state authority. That's why the majority of the Senate decided to revoke the broad powers, which were given to the Duke one year ago. It seems that Dmitry Romanov has to fight for the support also against some of the senators."
 rusd.146.a: "Oh well."

 rusd.147.t: "NRPR Goes Bankrupt"
 rusd.147.d: "Boris Savinkov's NRPR has seen a meteoric rise in popularity during the past few years. All the massive rallies they constantly hold and armed paramilitaries they own are not free, however. Hoping to break from obscurity as quickly as possible, Savinkov and the NRPR took loan after loan to fund their political campaigns, and they hoped that they would be able to write off all of their debts upon coming to power. This has not happened and the National Populist movement has found itself severely indebted, with no way to pay off their staff or workers, and popular support for them waning because of ongoing economic stabilisation.\n\nSavinkov was forced to lay off campaigners, disband many of the party's branches, and significantly cut the size of the Combat Squads. His movement has started to splinter, the left wing has broken off and its leaders began blasting Savinkov in national newspapers, accusing him of running the NRPR as a clique of yesmen... all in all, it has not been a good year for them. Popular support for the NRPR has decayed, their rallies have ceased, and their deputies in the Duma have chosen to ally with the Octobrists and Eurasianists.\n\nIt appears that Savinkov's hopes of taking power in Russia have been dashed for good."
 rusd.147.a: "And nobody shed a tear."

 rusd.148.t: "Nikolay Ustryalov's History of the Civil War"
 rusd.148.d: "Eminent professor Nikolay Ustryalov has published a history of the Russian Revolution and the Civil War, sparking discourse among intellectuals. In his history, Ustryalov presents a massive break from standard Russian historiography, delving deep into the political and social policy of the Bolshevik movement and doing away with its villainisation. He states that while the bloodshed committed during the Russian civil war was unacceptable and could not be tolerated, Vladimir Lenin and his followers had very clear reformist goals, some of which they implemented - such as calendar reform, land reform, and equality between sexes. If the Bolsheviks were more moderate in their approach, a Russia led by them could have been stronger in the long term. Ustryalov even challenges the limits of our tolerance by considering that the Bolsheviks were the only \"nationalist\" faction in the Civil War - they were supported by no one, whereas the White movement was supported by the Entente Powers and later by Germany.\n\nMore right wing intellectuals, such as Ustryalov's former ally Nikolay Trubetskoy, have challenged this viewpoint, creating a debate in the scientific community on how the Russian Civil War should be treated. It is thanks to our liberal, democratic society that this debate can take place without any intervention from above."
 rusd.148.a: "Hurrah for the freedom of speech!"

 rusd.149.t: "Russo-German Study Society"
 rusd.149.d: "The growth of international Syndicalism and the threat it poses to Russia has gotten a handful of our intellectuals to look towards Germany as a potential ally. The so-called \"Russo-German Study Society\" has been established in Moscow and unites a circle of historians, writers, and politicians who all share staunch right-wing ideals. In its first proclamation, the Society has stated that Russia should finally come to terms with the losses of Brest-Litovsk, and strike an agreement with Germany to reclaim the Caucasus and Central Asia in exchange for forming an anti-Syndicalist axis. This \"Berlin-Moscow Axis\" would be able to overcome Syndicalism through sheer combined might and manpower.\n\nThe Society's call to abandon Russian irredentism in the West has eroded the influence it could have over our policy, however."
 rusd.149.a: "Keep an eye on them, they could be traitors."

 rusd.150.t: "National Rearmament"
 rusd.150.d: "Russia may hold ambitions of retaking the West, but even the most radical Russian nationalists can tell that she will not be able to challenge Germany in this state. Her military industry has been neglected and her economy is not yet ready to out-produce the West. Though Russia holds massive potential, many sacrifices will have to be made before we will be able to repudiate the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Which is why these sacrifices have been proposed. The government has been introduced a bill for national rearmanent, including austerity policies and the expansion of state owned arms production enterprises, even if they will come at a cost."
 rusd.150.a: "Anything to reclaim our lost territories!"
 rusd.150.b: "Limited expansion should be enough."

 rusd.151.t: "All Quiet in the Senate"
 rusd.151.d: "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov could finally stop the lasting crisis which weakened Russia. Though the problem is that Dmitry Pavlovich doesn't always pay attention to the advice of the Senate and it often leads to the misunderstanding between the Grand Duke and this important state authority. But there are still good chances that they will find a proper way to negotiate and to recover Russia."
 rusd.151.a: "We hope so."

 rusd.152.t: "The National Bloc"
 rusd.152.d: "Dmitry Romanov has yet to get accustomed to his new duties and powers, which means that a large clique is starting to gather around him in hope that they will be able to use him to their interest. After negotiations, the Octobrists and a plethora of smaller political parties have chosen to join forces, gathering to a tight political alliance named the National Bloc. Its political programme calls for extensive political and social reform to maintain stability and prevent the growth of radical left wing forces, it is funded by several industrialist lobbies and supported by aristocrats.\n\nThe National Bloc has thrown its full weight behind President Romanov, granting him and his government a stable base of supporters in both houses of Parliament."
 rusd.152.a: "It is time for a return to normalcy."

 rusd.153.t: "Dmitry Romanov Assumes Power"
 rusd.153.d: "The Kremlin Palace in Moscow was not left vacant for long. Dmitry Romanov, Grand Duke of the House of Romanov and member of the Senate, has been elected as the new President of Russia with a narrow majority of Octobrists, Russian nationalists, Eurasianists, and right wing Kadets. Playing the role of a "Modern Romanov", Dmitry finds his appeal among conservative republicans and constitutional monarchists alike, both of whom see a saviour in the man. After getting elected by the Senate, the Grand Duke declared it as his first intention to restore stability to the fallen nation - surprisingly, or perhaps not so, he made sure to omit any promises to support democracy in particular. Neither he nor the right-wing Senators who stand behind his back are all that thrilled with the democratic governance which the Left champions, although they're fine with paying lip service to it.\n\nThe people await the first actions of their new President."
 rusd.153.a: "Perhaps he can save Holy Russia."

 rusd.154.t: "The Summer Camps of \"Yunarmiya\""
 rusd.154.d: "One of the most important aims of the \"Yunarmiya\" is the formation of the summer camps for the children, where they will be able to spend summer and be involved in the various activities, studying the new ideology of Russia. Our Vozhd proposes that the first camp, called \"Sovyonok\" (\"Owlet\") should be built in the Yekaterinodar region, on the Black Sea coast. It seems to be a perfect place for the Russian children, where they will have fun for three months."
 rusd.154.a: "They will remember this summer as a long one, maybe even as an everlasting."

 rusd.155.t: "The New Duma?"
 rusd.155.d: "After Savinkov's rise to power, the lower house of the Russian parliament - the State Duma - was dissolved. However some members of the Supreme Privy Council propose to re-establish this authority with limited powers. Besides the National Republican Party of Russia (NRPR) led by Savinkov, which will definitely have a majority, various business circles as well as conservative groups and politicians also want to take part in the election, promising that they will support our new state policy, but they also want to represent their interests and help the government to strengthen the Russian economy as well as the army. Though their support can be important for Savinkov, there is a chance that one day they will try to take control over the country..."
 rusd.155.a: "NRPR is strong, but needs connections in the elite. Start the elections!"
 rusd.155.b: "We don't need any independent legislators as well as the State Duma itself."

 rusd.156.t: "The New Duma Is Elected!"
 rusd.156.d: "After the elections to the State Duma, Savinkov's NRPR got 73%. The conservative and right parties as well as the movements led by the representatives of the Russian business and industry got the remaining 27% of the vote. It seems that the new legislators are ready to change Russian laws to improve the situation in the country."
 rusd.156.a: "Very well."

 rusd.157.t: "The Myth of October"
 rusd.157.d: "Though the Bolshevik Party may be destroyed and its influence rendered null by the Syndicalist movement, the October putsch, called a Revolution by some, left Russia changed forever. This means that it is very easy to blame Russia's faults and weaknesses not on inaction, not on the failures of the current government, but on the Bolsheviks who supposedly ruined it all - and the NRPR is sure to take advantage of this myth. History textbooks are being amended, a mass propaganda campaign started, and the message sent that the Bolshevik uprising was not just an ordinary uprising. An international conspiracy, one which sought to destroy holy Russia and make sure it never rises again, was responsible for funding the Bolshevik Party and supplying their uprising across central Russia, and were it not stopped by force of arms, it would have left Russia broken, destroyed and shattered. These textbooks make sure to note the fact that Vladimir Lenin had been sent to Petrograd by the Germans, and that many of the leading members of the Bolshevik Party were not Russian - Caucasians, Balts, Poles, and especially Jews."
 rusd.157.a: "You wanted to revoke our rights in 1917, but now you will lose yours."

 rusd.158.t: "Vox Populi"
 rusd.158.d: "Boris Kamkov, pre-1917 Savinkov's ally and later one of his main enemies, who had became the leader of the Left SRs after the assassination of Maria Spiridonova, died this night in Moscow. It happened when Savinkov's Combat Squads broke into the house, where an illegal Left SR meeting took place, and Kamkov, trying to escape, jumped in the Moscow River and drowned. According to the famous sarcastic writer Ivan Bunin, the \"vox populi\" about this incident seems to be sneers or indifference - just like Savinkov and the NRPR want."
 rusd.158.a: "Farewell Boris, farewell Boris, I'll see you in my dreams."

 rusd.159.t: "Shattering the Democratic Opposition"
 rusd.159.d: "Until this point, leaders and high ranking members of the "establishment" parties, namely the Kadets, Right SR and Octobrists, have gotten away lightly. As long as they did not raise too much of a fuss, they were allowed to keep on living and doing their jobs. The extent to which Russia is rapidly being transformed to Savinkov's wishes intimidates them, as much as it did the socialists, and so they ultimately decided they had enough. Viktor Chernov, Pavel Milyukov and Ariadna Tyrkova have collectively drafted a manifesto in which they declared the formation of a Movement to Restore the Constitution and sent a demand to Savinkov to resign and allow free elections.\n\nSavinkov was not pleased, and the regime immediately moved against the democrats. A crackdown on democratic leaders has begun, numerous newspapers have been closed and their editors arrested, and the prisons overflowing with political arrests yet again. The downfall of the democratic constitutionalists left the last possible challenge to Savinkov's unquenched ambition dead in a ditch."
 rusd.159.a: "It was not a matter of if. Only when."

 rusd.160.t: "The Purge"
 rusd.160.d: "Though thousands have already been summarily executed and many more arrested for real or suspected crimes, Savinkov's paranoia has not been satiated. Enemies still lurk at every corner to him and the Syndicalists may come for his head any moment now. This is where one of the rising stars in the National Republican Party and the Deputy Minister of Interior, Viktor Abakumov, stepped in to offer a solution. To ensure that the Vozhd's rule is forever solid and his regime lasts a thousand years, the Russian nation must learn to fear, and above all else, its enemies must learn to fear.\n\nAbakunov's brainchild is a purge not from the top down, done via orders to arrest this dissident or that dissident, but instead from the bottom up. All regional governors need to be given quotas of "enemies of the state" they need to find, extract, and purge. Those who do not deserve a bullet to the back of the head should work off their debt instead - the Tsarist Okhrana laid the groundwork for deporting thousands of dissidents to Siberia, but this system can be modernised, industrialised, and turned into an archipelago of destruction. Even those who are not plotting against Russia must know their place - Abakunov offers to incentivise ratting out possible enemies of the state in workplaces, schools or even families, creating an atmosphere of worry and uncertainty under which the masses will flock to the only thing which can keep them safe, loyalty to the Vozhd.\n\nEven fellow members of the NRPR believe that Abakumov's proposal is... crazy, but Savinkov has taken personal interest in the proposal."
 rusd.160.a: "This all sounds rather dreary..."
 rusd.160.b: "Just like we said. Through pain, a stronger Russia will rise."

 rusd.161.t: "Trial of the Left Separatists"
 rusd.161.d: "The NRPR's policy towards Russia's numerous ethnic minorities has always been very abstract. Though much of its support comes from Russian nationalists, Savinkov himself recognises that Russia is too ethnically divided for him to be able to go too far. What he and the Party can do, however, is take action against Russia's ethnic minorities via proxy. During the Russian Civil War, many ethnic minority groups joined the Bolshevik side, hoping to achieve autonomy in a greater Soviet Russia, and thus gained the collective term of "Left Separatists".\n\nCiting this as an example of possible minority disloyalty, Savinkov's regime has begun the move against them, pressuring numerous ethnic newspapers to close and arresting hundreds of high profile minority politicians, such as Jews, Tatars, Finns, Volga Germans, and Yakuts. Minority regions have had their administration staffed with "loyalists", generally Russians."
 rusd.161.a: "You fought the law and the law won!"

 rusd.163.t: "Pavel Gorgulov and the KPZ-NRPR"
 rusd.163.d: "Rapidly growing in strength during the 1930s, the NRPR absorbed several other far right parties in the Russian sphere to its enormous mass, all of them bringing political concepts and ideas of their own. One of these was the Peasant Green Party (Kryestyanskoy partii zelyonikh), led by Pavel Gorgulov, a Kuban Cossack writer and political ideologue. Though as Russian chauvinist, anti-semitic and nationalist as any other member in Savinkov's party, the KPZ emphasises the connection which the Russian people have with the soil and with the peasant life.\n\nAfter Savinkov's takeover of Russia, Pavel Gorgulov, now appointed as the Minister of Agriculture, has began taking on tours across the country, bringing the message of the NRPR to dozens of villages across Central and Southern Russia. His call of "Russia for Russians" and this emphasis on the "national peasantry" reflects in the reforms he's undertaken ever since his appointment - their aim is to turn Russian villages into tightly knit, ethnically pure communities, perfectly obedient to the Vozhd and representative of Russian national superiority.\n\nGorgulov's views are also highly esoteric and even his subordinates aren't sure whether he is... sane. His emphasis on the peasantry culminates in his messianic belief that "wild, primitive and Scythian" Russian civilisation will prevail over Western civilisation and establish a new order across the world. His somewhat low ranking role in the government means that this creed has little influence over the government, although his "agrarian" faction within the NRPR, composed mostly of former members of the KPZ, stands by his ideology."
 rusd.163.a: "Interesting ideas..."

 rusd.164.t: "The Russian Academy of Sciences"
 rusd.164.d: "While the Moscow Accord and our membership within it is, theoretically, of a purely military nature, the reality is far more complex than that. One of the legacies of the Great War was the advent of mass mobilisation - the consolidation of large swathes of potentially useful sectors of society into an apparatus designed to aid the war effort. The field of technology was included in this - in the efforts to break the trench warfare of the Western Front, military technology created bold new inventions such as landships in the hopes of finally turning the tide. As result of mobilisation such as this, the line between civilian and military resources became somewhat blurred - and the recent growth of ever-present international tensions have ushered the start of a global arms race, something that nobody can afford to be left behind in.\n\nTo this end, the old and prestigious Russian Academy of Sciences has been given a new mandate by [RUS.GetNameDef] - the coordination of research efforts across Russia and her allies, and the swift dissemination of breakthroughs between them, particularly breakthroughs with potential military applications. As we are currently on very good terms with Russia, we have been extended an invitation to contribute talent to this programme and share research between us and other participating nations. The potential boons that this could have for our technological development are, of course, obvious and plentiful."
 rusd.164.a: "Excellent."

While accepting their request could strengthen our international position, the steep cost of giving away Russian land has caused opposition within our government who want to reject [From.GetNameDefCap]'s request for Russian land."
 rusfor.54.a: "It's a worthy price."
 rusfor.54.b: "These are rightful Russian lands!"

 rusfor.55.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 rusfor.55.d: "[Root.GetAdjective] diplomacy has proven to be successful today as [From.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to return our core lands in exchange for our entry into the Moscow Accord. [From.GetNameDefCap] has shown that it is a true friend of [Root.GetName] and we look forward to further cooperation in the years to come."
 rusfor.55.a: "Magnificent!"

 rusfor.56.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 rusfor.56.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has shown its true colours as an enemy of [Root.GetName] and has refused to return our rightful land. There is no doubt now that diplomacy is impossible with the Russian bear and only war will be able to solve our issues."
 rusfor.56.a: "As expected."

 rusfor.57.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
 rusfor.57.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has outrageously refused our request to form an alliance, if they will not come to the discussion table then war seems like the only solution to this problem. For now we will wait but mark our words, Russia will return!"
 rusfor.57.a: "Their loss."

 rusfor.58.t: "Agreement of Russo-Finnish Friendship"
 rusfor.58.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has sent us a surprising proposal. To ensure the safety of both St. Petersburg and [FIN.GetNameDef] against ever-present German aggression, our two nations must put aside their disagreements and work together for safer Baltic region. The Russians are giving up any claims on our territory, if in exchange we ally them and agree to defend the region together, and not cede in to German pressure.\nThere is a thinly-veiled edge to their words, in almost a manner of presumed acceptance, but their offer seems genuine."
 rusfor.58.a: "Quite a surprise, but a welcome one."
 rusfor.58.b: "This is another of their plots. No!"

 rusfor.59.t: "$rusfor.56.t$"
 rusfor.59.d: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] has refused our generous offer to take them under our protection. Perhaps we underestimated their stubborness."

 rusfor.1066.d: "The bold Russians are trying to expand their influence in the Caucasus and it seems we are their new target. They have sent a demand - we must return them Azerbaijan, as well as any other controlled parts of the Caucasus, or face war with [FROM.GetNameDef]. How should we respond to this grave insult?"
 rusfor.1066.a: "We are powerless against Russian might..."
 rusfor.1066.b: "Never!"

 rusfor.1068.b: "Back down... for now."

 rusfor.1082.t: "The Transamur Takeover"
 rusfor.1082.d: "With the resurgent Russian state gaining full control over the once disputed Trans-Siberian railroad from Mongolia, commercial contacts have increased massively with the Transamur Republic, and Japan's economic presence in Transamur has started to fade in comparison with the inflow of massive Russian investments. The Economy of Transamur, a rebellious state created via Japanese incursion during Russian civil war, started to experience serious economic difficulties thanks to relatively unrestricted influx of cheaper goods, coming through the recently liberated Trans-Siberian railroad. The weakened state can now be easily taken with a detachment of a few soldiers."
 rusfor.1082.a: "Claim Transamur! All Russians must be under Russian rule!"
 rusfor.1082.b: "Send a detachment of troops to Vladivostok to dissolve Transamur!"

 rusfor.1083.t: "The Russians Claim Transamur!"
 rusfor.1083.d: "Following the re-establishment of Russian control over the Trans-Siberian railroad the Russians have announced that the Transmur-Primorsk region is rightfully a Russian province! Can we afford to oppose an increasingly powerful Russia for the sake of Transamur or should we concentrate on China?"
 rusfor.1083.a: "Send a warning, Transamur is our protectorate!"
 rusfor.1083.b: "Abandon Transamur to its fate."

 rusfor.1084.t: "Russian Troops Arrive in Vladivostok!"
 rusfor.1084.d: "Following the re-establishment of Russian control over the Trans-Siberian railroad the Russians have decided to enlist the support of some rebellious Transamurian capitalists in order to establish control over the Primorsk territory by force! Can we afford to oppose an increasingly powerful Russia for the sake of Transamur or should we concentrate on China?"
 rusfor.1084.a: "We shall defend Transamur!"
 rusfor.1084.b: "Abandon Transamur to its fate."

 rusfor.1087.t: "Transamur Is Russian!"
 rusfor.1087.d: "Facing the threat of Russian military force and deprived of the support of the local capitalists and the Japanese, Transamur's government is ready to collapse in the face of the popular will. We can now do what we like with Transamur but it has been independent for a long time and will be difficult to integrate into our country. Perhaps some sort of compromise is needed?"
 rusfor.1087.a: "Put their leaders on trial and incorporate Transamur!"

 rusfor.1088.t: "The Japanese Have Sent a Warning"
 rusfor.1088.d: "The Japanese are not happy that we are interfering in Transamur's internal politics and have warned us that it is rightfully a Japanese protectorate. However, they have other military concerns at the moment and may not be willing to risk a two front war to protect a colony of minimal importance."
 rusfor.1088.a: "Call their bluff, send in the troops!"

 rusfor.1089.t: "The Russian Army Enters Our Territory"
 rusfor.1089.d: "Not fearing the threat of Japanese involvement since our liberation the Russians have sent an army to Vladivostok with the hope to annex our territory. How shall we react to this aggression?"

 rusfor.1113.b: "Tuva is rightfully ours!"

 rusfor.1114.t: "[FROM.GetName] Surrenders!"
 rusfor.1114.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has bowed down and accepted our rightful claim on the Russian lands they possessed; we are now in possession of Northern Mongolia once more!"
 rusfor.1114.a: "Great!"

 rusfor.1116.t: "Border Clashes in Tuva!"
 rusfor.1116.d.baron: "We have just received a written response from the \"Mad Baron\" himself, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. In his response the Baron presents us with nothing more than a series of excuses, attempting to justify a demand to return 'rightful Mongol territory'. The strongman of Asia has shown his true colours, grovelling at our feet hoping that we will overlook his defiance."
 rusfor.1116.d.other: "We have just received a response from the [FROM.GetAdjective] government, demanding the return of Tuva and presenting a series of flimsy excuses as to why the state is rightfully [FROM.GetAdjective] territory. They have mobilised, and clashes have already begun between [FROM.GetAdjective] and [ROOT.GetAdjective] troops."

 rusfor.1180.d.ROM: "Yesterday the Russian government demanded the return of the Bessarabia region. If we agree with Russian claims, we will lose a major part of our territory, but if we refuse, we shall face an immediate Russian invasion. How should we react to these awful claims from the Russian leadership?"
 rusfor.1180.d.ROM_overlord: "Yesterday the Russian government demanded the return of the Bessarabia region. If we agree with Russian claims, Romania will lose 1/3 of its territory, but if we refuse, we shall both face an immediate Russian invasion. How should we react to these awful claims from the Russian leadership?"
 rusfor.1180.a: "Accept their terms."
 rusfor.1180.b: "Never!"

 rusfor.1181.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses!"
 rusfor.1181.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government published a note, where it insists that Bessarabia is rightfully Romanian territory, and Russia will never get it back. The only solution to this problem for us is war with [From.GetNameDef]."
 rusfor.1181.d.ally: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has politely refused our request, stating their hard-won conflict against the Romanians, and their wish to preserve goodwill between themselves and their subservient government in Bucharest."

 rusfor.1182.a: "Another victory for Russian diplomacy!"

 rusfor.1183.t: "Russia Requests Bessarabia"
 rusfor.1183.d: "Yesterday the Russian government requested the return of the Bessarabia region. As it comes from the leader of our mutual alliance, and the former controller of the state in question, the request was an amicable one. If we agree with Russian claims, Romania will lose 1/3 of its territory, but our allies will be grateful for the support."
 rusfor.1183.a: "This seems reasonable."
 rusfor.1183.b: "It suits the Romanians better."

 rusfor.1190.t: "Russia Demands Armenia"
 rusfor.1190.d.TUR: "Under the pretense of 'protecting the Armenian Christian people', Russia has issued series of outrageous demands that would essentially cede control of Armenia up to the city of Kars to Russia. In attempt to seem diplomatic, they even offered that the Armenians should hold a referendum themselves, with Russians guaranteeing the freedom of such election. It's all just an imperialist charade, but they seem to be serious. Threat of military escalation is imminent."
 rusfor.1190.d.TUR_overlord: "Our loyal regime in Istanbul informed us that under the pretense of 'protecting the Armenian Christian people', Russia has issued series of outrageous demands that would essentially cede control of Armenia up to the city of Kars to Russia.

 rusfor.1192.t: "The Transfer of Armenia"
 rusfor.1192.d: "In a desperate attempt to avoid total destruction, the occupiers of Armenia have retreated, and have acknowledged our right to protect our Armenian brothers.

Our forces put up a good fight but were pushed aside, and now the country is holding its breath in anticipation of the hardships of a Russian invasion.

Not only have the Romanians held off the brunt of the initial assault, but they have also managed to repel us for quite some time by now!

It is obvious that we have to do something with their legacy and turn our new citizens into loyal and peaceful members of the Russian society. Now we have two propositions - we can establish a special Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia or give an additional powers to the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly, which is controlled by the loyal Tatars and Bashkirs."

Russia, meanwhile, officially pursues a policy of Realpolitik, approaching with pragmatism and seeking to expand the Accord into an alliance to match the Internationale and Reichspakt."

### Characters ###
 RUS_irakli_tsereteli: "Irakli Tsereteli"
 RUS_irakli_tsereteli_leader_desc: "A noble from the famous Tsereteli lineage, Irakli Tsereteli turned towards socialism during his childhood, when he came to recognise the vast difference between his wealthy family and the impoverished citizens of Kutaisi, and swore to fix this imbalance. As a law student in Moscow, Tsereteli became embroiled in student protests, was imprisoned, and willingly chose to be deported to Siberia instead of returning to his home. There, he became acquainted with Marxism and joined the RSDRP, although he came to conflict with Lenin and joined the Menshevik faction instead. In 1906, he was elected to the Duma despite being only twenty five years old, and became one of the most prominent leaders of the Menshevik faction. He was once again arrested and deported after the Stolypin coup, but by then, his status as the champion of social democracy was solidified.\n\nIn exile, Tsereteli developed the idea of Siberian Zimmerwaldism - internationalist social democracy - and he returned to Petrograd after the February Revolution. He took a leading role in the Menshevik party, the Petrograd Soviet and Provisional Government, but broke with the Soviets after the Bolshevik takeover and fled to Georgia. Though he worked in the Menshevik government of Noe Zhordania for some time, he became disillusioned with its growing nationalism, which clashed with his internationalism, and thus Tsereteli returned to Russia after the Civil War. The Mensheviks, with the destruction of their former Bolshevik allies, took the RSDRP mantle solely for themselves, and thanks to Tsereteli's leadership, they have managed to return to prominence from the clutches of death. For the longest time, he has served as Leader of the Opposition. In Russian politics, Tsereteli represents innocence and optimism which has long since been lost - he refuses to partake in dirty politics, violence, and concerns himself with eradicating inequality above anything else."

 RUS_aleksandr_kerensky: "Aleksandr Kerensky"
 RUS_aleksandr_kerensky_leader_desc: "To talk about modern Russian politics is to talk about the life of Aleksandr Kerensky, the Republic's founding father to some and a symbol of its decay to others. A noted lawyer and legal professor, Kerensky sympathised with the radical socialist movement in his youth and served as legal counsel to several revolutionaries imprisoned after the Revolution of 1905, he was even a childhood friend of Vladimir Lenin. Eventually, however, he accepted that socialism can only be achieved through reform, and by the time the Great War began, he was a leading member of the socialist opposition in the State Duma. This propelled him to lead the republican Provisional Government after the February Revolution - briefly, before he was overthrown by the Bolsheviks. Kerensky returned to power in 1920, as the first President of the Russian Republic, a man changed by years of exile and the damage which the Russian Civil War dealt to the country.\n\nIn 1936, Kerensky marks his fifteenth year as President, a feat achieved thanks to a lack of competent opposition, plenty of political manipulation, fearmongering over the everpresent Kolchak putschist threat, and often just downright luck. In all these years in power, Kerensky established land reform, helped rejuvenate the Russian economy with the New Economic Policy programme, and recognised his country's territorial losses in the west. Recent political crises, corruption scandals, and growing opposition to his rule have turned his rule shaky, however. As time went, Kerensky has turned more and more towards the right, his socialist credentials now practically non-existent and his bitterness growing, which is eroding the last of his allies in the SR-Kadet coalition. The President remains certain, however - his rule will end either by constitutional decree or by a bullet."

 RUS_viktor_chernov: "Viktor Chernov"
 RUS_viktor_chernov_leader_desc: "Viktor Chernov was born to the old Russian nobility in Saratov and turned towards revolutionary politics after getting acquainted with the works of the Russian Populist movement in his gymnasium. Studying in Tartu and later in Moscow, Chernov was inducted into a circle of revolutionary friends which included Vladimir Lenin, Vasily Maklakov, Pavel Milyukov and numerous others who later ended up moulding Russian history. He vehemently rejected Marxism and its hostility towards the peasantry, and saw a potent revolutionary force in the impoverished, enserfed Russian villages - this ultimately drew him to the Socialist-Revolutionaries. By the turn of the century, he was a prominent member of the Tambov Zemstvo, a leading theorist of agrarian socialism, and a founding member of the PSR. He convinced his party to participate in electoral politics after the Revolution of 1905, until the 1907 Stolypin Coup, which shattered any hopes of a democratic Tsarist regime and convinced Chernov that only revolutionary methods will establish democracy in Russia.\n\nIn 1917, a bitter Chernov returned to Russia, joined the February Revolution and the Petrograd Soviet, only to witness that a decade of exile has shattered the unity of his party. He maintained a centrist position between the Right and Left SRs, but ultimately turned to the Right when the party broke, and became one of the most powerful allies of the Russian Republic. After the restoration of the Republic in 1920, Chernov and Kerensky formed a tandem which dominated Russia for the last fifteen years. While Kerensky was a gifted speaker and an excellent scapegoat, Chernov worked behind the scenes, forming increasingly unstable and big-tent coalitions to maintain the Socialist-Revolutionaries in power. The left hates him for betraying the October Revolution and the right despises him for being a leftist, but Chernov plays the two sides off to stay in power as long as he possibly can."

 RUS_pavel_milyukov: "Pavel Milyukov"
 RUS_pavel_milyukov_leader_desc: "Pavel Milyukov came from the affluent, educated upper urban class and has represented it for his entire life. A veteran of the Russo-Turkish War and a philosophy professor, Milyukov was influenced by the liberal ideas of Herbert Spencer and the Positivist thought of Auguste Comte. To compete in the constitutionally empowered Duma after the Revolution of 1905, he founded the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets), which he has run for the next forty years of his life. A party of intellectuals, liberal Zemstvo men, officials and Jews, the Kadets campaigned for a federal, constitutional solution for the Russian nation - if it's republican or democratic, doesn't matter. The Weltkrieg saw Milyukov heavily lurge to the right - he became a nationalist and a supporter of territorial expansion into the Balkans, which gave him the nickname "Milyukov of the Dardanelles".\n\nMilyukov was arguably one of the reasons for the collapse of the Provisional Government - as Kerensky's Minister of Foreign Affairs, he staunchly opposed even the discussion of peace with the Central Powers. Despite this, he and the Kadets were too influential to sideline, and after the Russian Civil War, they became one of the most influential political parties in the country. Milyukov has served in several governments and held the position of Prime Minister numerous times, most notably during the assassination of Aleksandr Kerensky. His age is catching up to him, but his mind is still sharp - and though Milyukov may be a constitutional democrat, he is a more vehement Russian imperialist than even the average NRPR-er."

 RUS_vasily_maklakov: "Vasily Maklakov"
 RUS_vasily_maklakov_leader_desc: "Born to the Muscovite intellectual upper class, Vasily Maklakov was practically destined to become a member of the Constitutional Democrats, the party which represented the interests of his class. His political career started while studying law - as a part of his thesis on ancient Greek democracy, he visited Paris and left impressed by its political system, one which he has sought to replicate in Russia since. He gained prominence as a briliant legal mind and an orator, the high point of his legal career was the defence of Menahem Mendel Beilis, a Russian Jew wrongfully accused of committing ritual murder in 1913. He was one of the founding members of the Kadets and represented the party's conservative wing - he sharply criticised Pavel Milyukov, but never to a point of destroying party unity.\n\nSome claim that Maklakov supplied Feliks Yusupov with the poison to murder Grigory Semyonov, but he himself denied it - however, Maklakov was opposed to Rasputin and declared the Tsarist regime a vehicle with no brakes, driven by a mad chaffeur. During the Russian Civil War, he maintained Russia's embassy in France, first in Paris and then in Algiers, and returned to his homeland in 1920 to restore the Kadet party. Though calling himself a liberal, Maklakov is a staunch opponent of socialism in all of its forms, and a believer that Russia's fragile democracy needs to be protected from domestic insurrection or foreign invasion at all costs - as long as the price to pay is not liberty."

 RUS_nikolay_trubetskoy: "Nikolay Trubetskoy"
 RUS_nikolay_trubetskoy_leader_desc: "Prince Nikolay Trubetskoy represents a new generation of Russian nobility, an educated, ideologically driven upper class which is opposed to radicalism from the right and from the left. A notable linguist and researcher into phonology, he spent much of his life working with Roman Jakobson to develop the foundations of modern phonetics and started the Prague School of linguistics research. He returned to Russia in the 1920s, however, in charge of the "Russian Union", a conservative monarchist party which declared itself to be a bridge between the increasingly anti-democratic right and the weakening moderate left.\n\nAlongside Pavel Savitsky, Nikolay Trubetskoy developed the ideology of Eurasianism, one which he and his party ascribe to. Trubetskoy's Eurasianism decrees that Russia is intrinsically tied to the peoples of Asia as well as Europe, and that their geopolitical position and history creates an exceptional role for Russia in world history. Russia should lead the fight against what Trubetskoy perceives as "the Europeanisation of the world" - Romano-Germanic culture, which, having developed its set of values and moral beliefs, drilled into its head that they are somehow universal. Russia should be at the forefront of a crusade against this cultural imperialism and create a world where each nation is able to develop independently of others. This ideology places Trubetskoy as a nationalist, Russian exceptionalist, and conservative staunchly opposed to Western ideals."

 RUS_ariadna_tyrkova: "Ariadna Tyrkova"
 RUS_ariadna_tyrkova_leader_desc: "Ariadna Tyrkova was born to the landowning nobility in Novgorod and studied in Saint-Petersburg, where she became acquainted with the liberal reformist publications of Pyotr Struve and thus shifted towards the liberal cause. She was a founding member of the Constitutional Democratic Party, a notable member of its right wing and a proponent of an alliance with the Octobrists. Her defining political stance, however, was her unassailable fight for the rights of women, which got the Kadets to add women's suffrage to their party platform. The Russian Civil War radicalised her, however. After a brief exile to Britain, she returned to Rostov in 1919, where she declared that liberal democracy has failed Russia and a strong, uniquely Russian government form must take charge instead.\n\nThis got her associated with Eurasianist circles after the Russian Civil War, and ultimately concluded in her becoming a founding member of the Russian Union. Russia's first democratically elected female head of state has a deeply conservative society to resist against, but she is no pushover, and will not shy away to assert Russia's role as the harbinger of Eurasia."

 RUS_lavr_kornilov: "Lavr Kornilov"
 RUS_lavr_kornilov_desc_body: "One of the most famous military commanders in modern Russian history, Lavr Kornilov is nevertheless a man of surprising mystery. Even his ancestry is a mystery - however, he is definitely of Siberian Cossack birth, and was raised in the harsh militaristic culture of his people. His military career began before the Weltkrieg and culminated in him being appointed the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army in 1917 - briefly, before the Kornilov affair. In an event which still stumps researchers, Kornilov marched troops on Petrograd, presumably under Kerensky's orders, and yet was removed from his post for this treason and escaped to the Don. There, he volunteered for the White Army and became one of its most talented commanders.\n\nKornilov's conflict with the government flared up after the end of the civil war, but at this point, it was him who had the upper hand, and he remained at his post. To those who believed that he might be a traitor, Kornilov proved himself by valiantly standing against Kolchak's coup attempt and helping save the Republic from destruction. Still, he remains one of the most ambitious, and yet at the same time most disillusioned of the White generals. It is no secret that he has formed an alliance with far right forces in the Russian republic, and once in power, he will not shy away from enabling them."

 RUS_boris_savinkov: "Boris Savinkov"
 RUS_boris_savinkov_leader_desc: "A terrorist, a violent madman, a murderer, a revolutionary and a dictator is just a few of many labels given to Boris Savinkov, the leader of the National Republican Party of Russia. Throughout his colourful life, he has assassinated and bombed many as a part of the Combat Organisation of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, before moving on to becoming a pragmatic schemer behind Aleksandr Kerensky's back - as Assistant War Minister in 1917, he nearly assumed dictatorial power in Russia from the shadows, and only the collapse of the Kornilov coup led to his downfall. However, he rehabilitated himself by organising the Union for the Defence of the Motherland, an underground resistance organisation in Moscow which prepared the soil for the city's fall in 1919.\n\nSavinkov may have once been a socialist, but he has long since abandoned the weak Socialist Revolutionaries in favour of a syncretic ideology of numerous ideas which have influenced him over the years - all of which merge into a system of totalitarian dictatorial rule, extreme Russian nationalism, and a concept of palingenetic rebirth: like an eagle rising from the ashes, the Vozhd shall restore the glory of the Russian state and transform it into a hegemon of reaction. Owing to his history of being a terrorist, constantly hiding from the authorities and anyone who might hand him over to the Okhrana, Savinkov is almost psychotically paranoid. He still sees enemies at every corner and constantly keeps his party on edge. Above anyone else, however, he despises socialism, in all of its forms."

 RUS_mikhail_drozdovsky_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gOctober 7th, 1881, in Kiev, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gMikhail Drozdovsky came from a long lineage of Russian nobles in Eastern Ukraine, many of whom served as officers in the army - and so did he. He graduated at the top of his class from the prestigious Pavlovsk Military School and fought in the Russo-Japanese War as an officer in the Life Guards Regiment, where he remained on the front lines despite injury and received several decorations for heroism. In the years that followed, he tried several prospective careers, including submarines and aircraft, but ultimately decided to stick to ground forces. His real career began after the February Revolution, when he was the first to denounce the authority of the republican government in Moscow and disobeyed orders. Stationed in Romania, he watched the Bolshevik takeover from afar and formed a military unit of his own, the Drozdovites, which marched off to join Mikhail Alekseyev's Volunteer Army in the Don.\n\nDuring the Civil War, he gained the reputation of a talented and strict, if reckless commander, who always made sure to assert that he was fighting for the holy House of Romanov. Though the dynasty was not restored, Drozdovsky continues to harbour hopes that the throne will be assumed by a righteous monarch of noble blood one day, and until that day comes, he has crafted a complex plan for the reform of the Russian army to bring it to modern standards."

 RUS_ivan_romanovsky_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gApril 28th, 1877, in Luhansk, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gAn artillerist by heritage and by education, Ivan Romanovsky was a veteran of the Russo-Japanese War and a respected division commander in the Weltkrieg when the 1917 revolutions began. Loyal to Lavr Kornilov, he joined the Volunteer Army in the Don and became a commanding officer in the high command. This is where he gained the nickname of the "Bad Luck General". Though a talented commander, he was blunt, sharp and never minced his words, shooting down ideas he thought unacceptable and berating those who proposed them in the general staff, which meant that he ended up hated by every single officer in the army corps except for Denikin and Kornilov. Republicans suspected him of being a monarchist and monarchists believed him to be a republican, but once the Civil War came to an end and he had to choose, Romanovsky stood by the Republic. His undiplomatic character means that he's been delayed in promotions, but his talent in warfare cannot be mistaken - he is a capable artillery commander and an expert in firepower concentration."

 RUS_anton_turkul_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gDecember 11th, 1892, in Tiraspol, Cherson Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gBorn to mixed Russian-Moldavian peasantry in Transnistria, Anton Turkul tried to pursue a military career before the Weltkrieg, but the military schools of Tiflis and Odessa failed to recognise his potential. Only when he was drafted to the Russian Army did his superiors begin to take note of his bravery in battle and sent him to accelerated training courses. Stationed in Romania, he was present for the formation of the Drozdovite Regiment and followed Drozdovsky to the Don, where he rose through the ranks of the White Army. In the restored Russian Republic, Turkul was no longer ignored and eventually gained the rank of General.\n\nOne of the youngest generals in the Russian general staff and yet highly talented, Turkul is considered by many to be the vanguard of a new generation of Russian officers. He's taken a liking to attracting attention to himself and helping craft this image as well - though he might be a little vain, he is still a valuable commander."

 RUS_vladimir_manstein_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gJanuary 3rd, 1894, in Kremenchug, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gThe son of general Vladimir von Manstein, Manstein was born to a family of Russified Germans who accepted Orthodoxy and abandoned much of their heritage. When the Weltkrieg began, Manstein was a cadet in the Pavlovsky Military School in Petrograd, his class was released ahead of schedule and commissioned in the army due to a severe lack of officers on the front. Even before the war began to take its toll, the officer's peers caught note of him - he was certainly brave and fearless, but in his own way, with a complete lack of restraint, sympathy, and full of contempt towards his fellow man. The events of 1917 only aggravated these tendencies - the collapse of the Russian Empire, which he wholeheartedly believed in, and a brutal injury during the Civil War, after which his left arm was amputated.\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War, Manstein gained the nickname "One-Armed Devil". Claiming to be "possessed by Russia", he commanded units in the White Army with exceptional efficiency, showed no remorse to Bolsheviks, and personally executed numerous political commissars - his contemporaries described him being as cold as a machine, "a terrible invention of death and blood". And for that, the Whites respected him whole-heartedly. After the Civil War, however, Manstein's life fell to a slump. War is all he had ever known, his injury meant that he was unable to find any other job, and his marriage turned estranged - before they could get divorced, his wife mysteriously disappeared, and rumours say that Manstein shot her himself. The disillusioned officer found his salvation in Boris Savinkov's national populism - its call for national rebirth and vengeance against Germany spoke to him, and he became a card-carrying member of the NRPR. Only his German heritage, as much as Manstein might deny it, prevents him from becoming Savinkov's closest ally."

 RUS_sergey_markov_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gJuly 19th, 1878, in Kronstadt, St. Petersburg Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §g\nSergey Leonidovich Markov was born to the family of an officer and pursued the same career with vigour. He graduated as an artillery officer and tasted warfare in the Russo-Japanese War, where he gained the nickname of "Leather General" - named as such for his style to wear black leather from head to toes. Already, his tendency for recklessness and unconventional, yet brilliant tactics began to show. After his service in Manchuria, Markov became a teacher in the prestigious Pavlovsk military academy, but duty called him to war once again when the Weltkrieg began. There, he served in the same unit as Anton Denikin, as one of his closest aides, and the two officers developed a mutual feeling of respect.\n\nAfter supporting Lavr Kornilov in his coup attempt, Markov was arrested, but escaped in the chaos after the Bolshevik takeover and escaped to the Don, where he joined the Volunteer Army. There, he distinguished himself as a legend among the White commanders, who would often take matters to his own hands, defeat numerically superior Red forces with the craziest tactics (such as standing on the tracks to stop an armoured train, yelling curses at the Bolsheviks as he bombed it with grenades), and saved the White cause from an early defeat. After the end of the Russian Civil War, Markov, a committed republican, remained in the army, and began crafting a new form of warfare based of his experiences of surprise engagements, armoured vehicles and manoeuvre in the war - though his ideas are radical, the potential behind them is incomprehensible."

After the Civil War, he returned to the Kuban Host, hoping to serve among his countrymen and keep them loyal to the new regime in Moscow."
