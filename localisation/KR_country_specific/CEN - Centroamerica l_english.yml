 cendem.1.a: "연방이여, 영원하라!"
 cendem.2.t: "연합당의 형성"
 cendem.2.d: "중앙아메리카 대륙의 통일을 원했던 여러 정당이 연합하여 탄생한 연합당이 과테말라 시우다드에서 첫 회의를 개최했습니다. 수년 동안 중앙아메리카의 통일을 준비해온 그들은 전당대회에 처음으로 모습을 드러냈고, 여타 정당들이 조직되고 나라가 나아가야 할 방향에 관한 회의가 열리기 전까지 임시로 정권을 이양받았습니다.\n\n과테말라 정치인 호세 페르펙토 아스미티아 곤살레스가 이끄는 연합당은 보수적이며, 이미 정당의 성명서를 통해 중앙아메리카 내 모든 문화를 포괄하는 광범위한 중앙아메리카 정체성을 만드는 것이 목표라고 밝혔습니다. 그들은 또한 외국인의 국정 간섭을 거부하고 있습니다. 이는 유나이티드 프루트 컴퍼니의 국내 영향력을 말소하는 것을 의미할 수도 있습니다..."
 cendem.2.a: "바라건데, 수많은 정당들 중 처음이길."
 cendem.3.t: "민주연합당의 형성"
 cendem.3.d: "민주연합당은 연방의 공식 정당으로 출범 후 첫 회의를 개최했습니다. 온두라스 테구시갈파에서 열린 이 회의는 사카사의 경제자립정책 계획에 적대감을 느끼는 많은 시장 자유주의자들을 하나로 묶고, 그들이 추구하는 정책에 관한 성명서를 발표했습니다. 특히 유나이티드 프루트 컴퍼니와 같은 외국 기업들과의 협력과 중앙아메리카 시장을 세계에 개방하는 것이 주요 당론입니다. 그러나 그들은 내전에 휘말린 미국이 중앙아메리카가 혼란에 빠진 이유 중 하나로 보고 있기 때문에 어떤 특정한 외국의 힘에 의존하고 싶지 않다고 합니다.\n\n유감스럽게도, 온두라스의 자유주의 진영인 호세 앙헬 수니가가 이끄는 세력은 니카라과의 호세 마리아 몽카다가 이끄는 세력의 반대에 직면하고 있으므로, 회의 중에 모든 문제가 해결되지는 않았습니다. 민주연합당은 당 대표 선출의 문제를 해결하기 위해 당 내 경선을 하기로 했고, 이번 경선의 승자가 당을 이끌게 됩니다."
 cendem.3.a: "호세 앙헬 수니가가 대중들의 선택을 받아 자리를 유지할 것입니다."
 cendem.3.b: "호세 마리아 몽카다가 정당 내 여론조사에서 앞서나갔습니다!"
 cendem.4.t: "자유당의 형성"
 cendem.4.d: "중앙아메리카 연방의 정치 지형이 형성되기 시작하면서, 연합당에게 도전할 또 다른 정당이 등장했습니다. 자유당은 마나과에서 공식적으로 창당되었으며, 구 니카라과 자유당의 후안 바우티스타 사카사를 수장으로 하여 연방의 공식 정당이 되었습니다. 자유당은 중앙아메리카의 경제적 독립을 약속하고, 농업 수출 기반 경제에서 산업 기반 경제로 전환할 것을 약속합니다. 이러한 전제에도 불구하고, 그들은 이 목표를 달성하기 위해 외국 기업들과 협력할 용의가 있다고 밝혔고, 이 덕분에 외국인 투자자들, 특히 그들의 자산이 압류될 것을 우려한 유나이티드 프루트 컴퍼티의 불안이 완화되었습니다."
 cendem.4.a: "자유주의의 불꽃은 중앙아메리카에서 계속해 불타리라!"
 cendem.5.t: "노동당의 형성"
 cendem.5.d: "자유당이나 연합당과 같이 원대한 야망을 가진 정당들이 정치 선전을 시작하는 동안, 노동당이 산 살바도르에서 결성되었습니다. 산 살바도르에서는 많은 중도좌파 정치인들과 사상가들이 많은 면에서 다른 정당들과 합의하면서도, 국가의 번영에 대한 야망보다는 중앙아메리카 농민들을 돕는 데 더 집중하고 있습니다. 노동당이 연방에 가져오고자 하는 많은 변화 가운데는 복지국가 수립, 토지개혁, 중산층 창출 등이 있는데, 이는 현재 우리나라에 매우 부족한 것입니다.\n\n이런 와중에 다른 나라의 수많은 정당들이 합쳐지면서, 프란시스코 세케이라 모레노가 이끄는 정통 사회 민주주의를 따르는 사람들과 살바도르 정치인 알베르토 마스페레르가 만든 수정 사회 민주주의와 아르투로 아라우호의 '활력주의'를 추종하는 사람들간 의견이 충돌하면서, 다음 선거에서 누가 당을 이끌게 될 것인지 불확실한 상태입니다. 이를 위해 전당대회를 거쳐 당원선거가 실시되었으며, 다음 선거 때 출마할 당 대표가 선출됩니다."
 cendem.5.a: "장미는 아라우호의 이상과 함께 중앙아메리카에 뿌리 내릴 것입니다."
 cendem.5.b: "장미는 모레노의 이상과 함께 중앙아메리카에 뿌리 내릴 것입니다."
 cendem.6.t: "제헌의회의 시작"
 cendem.6.d: "중앙정부 없이, 새롭게 창당된 모든 정당의 대표들 간에 의견을 조율하여 헌법을 제정하는 것은 어려운 일이었습니다. 회의가 열려야 할 도시에 대한 합의가 이루어지지 않았기 때문에 산 살바도르 시가 연방의 중심부에 위치하며, 대규모 정치 시위를 개최할 수 있는 기반 시설을 갖추고 있었으며, 독립의 시발점이 된 중앙아메리카 독립의 상징적인 장소이므로 선택되었습니다. 대표단이 도착하면, 가까운 미래에 연방이 어떠한 모습을 보여야 하는지에 대한 제언들을 받고, 제헌의회 의원들은 국가의 미래를 결정해야 할 의무가 있습니다."
 cendem.6.a: "자네들 모두 다 환영하네."
 cendem.7.t: "적들의 운명에 대한 논의"
 cendem.7.d: "제헌의회에서 헌법에 관한 문제를 결정하기 전에, 연합당이 중앙아메리카의 민주주의를 파괴하려고 시도했던 급진주의자들을 어떻게 할 것인지 논의하면서 제헌의회를 시작하자고 주장했고 이는 받아들여졌습니다. 제헌의회 의원들 모두가 사형에 찬성할 수 없다는 것은 분명하지만, 여전히 급진주의자들에 적합한 형벌을 결정해야 합니다. 민주연합당은 지도자들과 연방정부를 합법적으로 인정하지 않는 사람들을 추방할 것을 제안했는데, 이는 가장 관대한 해결책으로 여겨지지만, 범죄자들을 너무 자유롭게 풀어주는 것으로 보입니다. 연합당은 그들을 평생 감옥에 가두자고 제안하며, 이는 다소 간단한 해결책이기는 하지만, 만약의 사태가 발생할 경우 우리나라에 위험을 초래할 수 있습니다. 반면 노동당은 단순히 범죄자들을 투옥시키는 방안에서 나아가, 형량을 줄여주는 대가로 우리 나라의 재건과 개선에 필수적인 대규모 토목공사에 동원시키려고 합니다. 회의가 진전되기 전에, 이 문제는 우리나라의 단기적 안정을 위해 해결되어야 할 것입니다."
 cendem.7.a: "민주연합당이 제안한 것이 옳다."
 cendem.7.b: "연합당이 핵심을 짚었다, 이 범죄자들이 거리에서 자유롭게 돌아다녀선 절대 안 된다!"
 cendem.7.c: "범죄자라도 자신들의 죄를 용서받을 수 있어야만 한다!"
 cendem.8.t: "행정부 권력 논의: 대통령의 권한"
 cendem.8.d: "노동당이 제기한 주요 현안 중 하나는 대통령에게 너무 많은 권한을 주는 것이 장기적으로 얼마나 연방에 해가 될 수 있는가 하는 것입니다. 따라서 의회에서 3분의 2의 다수결이 성립될 경우 대통령 결정에 거부권을 행사하여 대통령의 힘을 줄이고자 하며, 이렇게 하지 않으면 권위주의 정권이 들어설 수 있는 기회가 열릴 것이라고 주장합니다. 하지만, 연합당은 이전 연방의 비효율적인 통치가 결국 연방의 해체를 이끌었기 때문에, 연방의 제자리를 잡기 위해서는 강력한 집행력이 필요하다고 주장합니다. 며칠간의 토론 끝에, 제헌의회 의원들은 이 문제에 대해 투표할 준비가 되었습니다."
 cendem.8.a: "대통령은 절대적인 거부권을 가지게 될 것이다."
 cendem.8.b: "의회는 재적 3분의 2의 다수결로 거부권을 번복할 수 있을 것이다."
 cendem.9.t: "헌법의 우위성에 관하여"
 cendem.9.d: "헌법이 구체화되기 시작함에 따라, 우리는 헌법이 연방에 어떤 역할을 할 것인지 결정해야 합니다. 이 회의를 통해 헌법에 절대적인 권한을 부여하여, 헌법에 위배될 경우 모든 지방법을 무용지물로 만들 수 있지만, 노동당에서는 이러한 방안이 위험한 수준으로 지방 자치권을 낮추는 동시에 연방정부에 힘을 줄 것이라고 주장합니다. 대신, 그들은 연방 헌법의 일부 핵심적 가치를 존중하는 한 지역 특색에 따라 자유로이 운영되게끔 헌법을 지방밥의 지침으로 사용하자고 제안합니다. 회의에서 무엇이 선택될까요?"
 cendem.9.a: "헌법은 어떤 성가신 지방법보다도 우선이다."
 cendem.9.b: "헌법은 지방 입법부의 지침적인 역할을 해야 한다."
 cendem.10.t: "중앙집권화된 수도?"
 cendem.10.d: "자유당의 주요 현안 중 하나는 연방이 각 회원국들을 동등한 지위에 두도록 노력해야 한다는 것이며, 그들은 국가를 지방분권화 하기 위하여 공화국의 3권을 다른 도시로 분할하자는 제안을 내놓았습니다. 제헌의회 의원들이 그들의 제안을 고려해야 할까요?"
 cendem.10.a: "아니, 연합은 중앙집권화 되어야 한다."
 cendem.10.b: "옳지, 각각의 도시에 권력을 분산시켜야 한다."
 cendem.11.t: "국가 수도 선정"
 cendem.11.d: "자유당의 제안이 부결된 후, 이제 새로 태어난 우리나라의 수도를 결정할 때입니다. 우리의 선택 중에는 첫 번째 연방의 발상지였던 과테말라 시우다드 데 과테말라, 100여 년 전 독립의 발상지였던 산 살바도르, 1880년 중앙아메리카 공화국의 원래 수도였던 테구시갈파, 그리고 니카라과의 옛 수도이자 중앙아메리카의 가장 위대한 도시 중 하나인 마나과가 있습니다. 제헌의회 의원들이 다음 회의 때까지 휴식을 취하기 위해 산 살바도르 대통령 관저에서 퇴근할 때, 라디오는 새 수도가...라고 보도했습니다."

 cendem.15.d: "한때 우리 시민들을 굴복시켰던 많은 반동적인 군대를 패배시킨 후, 이제 한 때 자유로웠던 국가를 종식시켰던 힘을 어떻게 할 것인지 결정해야 합니다. 우리의 주권을 확보하기 위해서는 국가에 힘이 필요하다는 것은 모두가 인식하고 있지만, 군대에 대한 접근방식은 각 당마다 다릅니다. 연합당은 연방 행정부에 예속되고 대통령이 직접 지휘할 수 있는 연방군을 제안했으며 이렇게 만들어진 연방군은 가능한 한 높은 전문성과 우수한 전술을 유지하기 위해 노력할 것입니다. 노동당은 다른 제안을 내놓았으며, 우리나라가 형성되기 전과 비슷하게 연합군을 만드는 것을 목표로 합니다. 그들은 중앙정부로부터 매우 적은 간섭을 받으며 각 지방정부에게 종속될 것이며 전쟁이 일어날 경우 하나의 연합군이 될 것입니다. 민주연합당은 브라질 군대와 유사하게 지역 민병대의 지원을 받는 연방 군대를 도입하는 혼합편대군 방안을 채택한 타협점을 제시했습니다. 제헌의회 의원들이 투표를 통해 우리 군대의 미래를 결정할 것입니다."
 cendem.15.a: "제한된 권력을 가진 연합군이 선택할 수 있는 최선의 선택지다."
 cendem.15.b: "타협은 정치만큼이나 오래된 수단이며, 성공적인 것임을 또 다시 증명할 것이다."

 cendem.18.t: "국민혁명당의 구성"
 cendem.18.d: "중앙아메리카의 여러 사회주의 운동의 잔재에서 탄생한 국민혁명당이 오늘 케살테낭고에서 결성되었습니다. 과테말라 사람 실베리오 오르티스가 이끄는 이 정당은 산디노나 마르티와 같은 전통적인 사회주의자에 비해 다소 온건한 형태의 사회주의 정당입니다. 당은 정치 참여를 허용하기 위해 한때 중앙아메리카를 혼란에 빠뜨렸던 급진주의자들과 결탁하지 않기로 다른 정당들에게 선서를 할 수밖에 없었습니다. 토지개혁, 서민 복지, 원주민 권리 향상이라는 그들의 강령은 중앙아메리카 사회주의의 패배에도 불구하고 여전히 연방에 남아있을 수 있었습니다."

 CEN_DEM_no_big_guys_radsoc_edition_desc: "Central America has gone through enough war already.

 CEN_DEM_telephone_for_everyone_desc: "The Telephonic industry in our nation is a vital asset, and we consider that we cannot allow it to be controlled by private entities as they can cut off large chunks of our population for the sake of profit.

 CEN_DEM_i_love_mexico_desc: "Many wealthy industrialists and land owners have managed to amass huge amounts of wealth at their worker's expense. While we cannot take their wealth directly, we can increase the taxes they pay in order to redistribute some of that income to the poor and needy in our nation. In order to do so, we shall enact a tax reform that will allow the tax ceiling to be raised."

 CEN_DEM_Forging_Uniformity_desc: "Our forces right now are a mixed bag of units with varying levels of training and equipment standards.

 CEN_DEM_Complete_Integration: "통합 완수"
 CEN_DEM_Complete_Integration_desc: "With our army following a standard, we now just need to integrate the local officer corps into a unified meritocratic system, trying to adapt the officers to a new hierarchy in order to correctly give them their ranks based on their experience and knowledge, rather than any other random standard that the previous republics had."

 CEN_DEM_One_Army_One_Head_desc: "Our army currently have separate planning boards made up of different officers from different academies scattered throughout the region.

 CEN_DEM_Longterm_Planning: "장기간 계획"
 CEN_DEM_Longterm_Planning_desc: "With our army ready for combat, it would be a wise move to start preparing several defence and offence plans in case of an attack by a foreign power to our nation, not much unlike the United States prepares their Rainbow Plans. We shall contact our national joint planning board to start the preparations."
 CEN_DEM_Learn_To_Dig: "참호 훈련"
 CEN_DEM_Learn_To_Dig_desc: "The harsh terrain in Central America make the art of trench digging a lot more difficult than it is in European battlefields.

 CEN_DEM_long_conscription: "징병기간 연장"
 CEN_DEM_long_conscription_desc: "Our soldiers are precious, and their experience is now more important than ever before. We can't allow that expertise to be wasted on the civilian front if it's not needed, and so we shall increase conscription times. This way we can keep more of our experienced soldiers for a longer amount of time before they are finally replaced by fresh reserves."

 CEN_DEM_Power_To_Local_officers_desc: "In order to be able to successfully reform our army into a mixed entity with both a federal and local structure, we cannot use any sort of fixed standards for our officers, so we shall proceed in the opposite direction.

 CEN_DEM_Support_Groups: "지원팀 통합"
 CEN_DEM_Support_Groups_desc: "An elite force isn't just a bunch of veteran soldiers carrying out orders. There have to be engineers assisting their advance on harsh terrains and scouts helping them avoid enemy strongholds and attack enemy weak points. It is the need for such support companies that we shall invest in the integration of said teams to our elite forces."
 CEN_DEM_Artillery_Corps: "교리 내 포격 통합"
 CEN_DEM_Artillery_Corps_desc: "With our system, we cannot depend on a number advantage to beat the enemy. Luckily, one of the greatest inventions in the 20th century for warfare has been artillery, which allows us to pound enemy positions from relative safety as long as we can outrange the enemy's artillery. In order to always have the upper hand against their artillery, we shall begin investing in better artillery models."

 CEN_DEM_motorised: "차량화 시작"
 CEN_DEM_motorised_desc: "With the improvement in speed in cars during the last few decades, the military relevance of motorised and mechanised cannot be underestimated.

 CEN_DEM_speed: "신속함이 답이다"
 CEN_DEM_speed_desc: "Armies that can't secure a victory quickly inevitably get drawn into prolonged attrition wars which are both costly and ineffective. We cannot afford ourselves to be drawn into such a conflict with our new armed forces, and it is for this reason that we should focus on achieving a swift victory over our enemies rather than pushing ourselves into an attrition war."
 CEN_DEM_combined_arms: "제병합동 훈련"
 CEN_DEM_combined_arms_desc: "The theory of combined arms combat is growing more relevant as the use of radio allows for greater coordination between the army, the armoured corps and the air force to combat the enemy more effectively.

 CEN_DEM_conscription_propaganda: "자발적이되 장려되는 징병제"
 CEN_DEM_conscription_propaganda_desc: "Volunteers for the army before were few and far in between, mainly because the armies had a bad reputation of harbouring tyrants in waiting and having poor living conditions for the average soldier.

 CEN_DEM_no_nepotism_desc: "Nepotism has been practically endemic in most of Central America, and while we do understand that 'better the devil you know than the devil you don't' has its usages in the military sphere, we can't afford the creation of military dynasties in our army that are not based on merit. We shall enact strict meritocratic measures to restrict generals from promoting family members unless they offer the qualifications needed for their posts."
 CEN_DEM_military_parades: "군사 열병식"
 CEN_DEM_military_parades_desc: "A way of instilling pride for our armed forces is the celebration of yearly military parades nationwide, to give a chance to each local army to show off both at home and in the rest of the country the achievements they have accomplished in terms of discipline in such a short time. We shall decree the celebration of a military parade, effective immediately and that shall be made an annual celebration."

 CEN_DEM_loyalty_desc: "Our armies, beyond their individual loyalties to their respective nation, also have a responsibility to a national scale to protect their brothers and sisters from the other members of the Confederacy as well as they would defend their own people.

 CEN_DEM_Back_to_base_ics: "비행장 건설"
 CEN_DEM_Back_to_base_ics_desc: "In order for our planes to fly, they must be able to land and take off safely.

 CEN_DEM_Shatter_their_Skies: "대공포 혁신"
 CEN_DEM_Shatter_their_Skies_desc: "Our ships need new weapons in order to keep them competitive. We must advance our flak gun technology and mount it on our ships in order to improve their fighting power and effectiveness in battle. These guns will help our fleet immensely."

 CEN_DEM_Three_kinds_of_Aces_desc: "The morale and efficiency of our Air Force will grow exponentially if our pilots have heroes to look up to and emulate. We must find pilots willing to do everything for their country, pilots who exceed what everyone thinks is possible.

 CEN_DEM_Seek_Strength: "전투기 군비경쟁"
 CEN_DEM_Seek_Strength_desc: "We must not sit by idly as other countries develop better and more advances fighters that will easily outperform ours. We must stay competitive and work hard to develop and field newer and better fighter models. Our best minds must be put to work to make this happen."
 CEN_DEM_Live_For_Pride: "공중전 훈련"
 CEN_DEM_Live_For_Pride_desc: "Our pilots need to be trained in what could be called the art of dogfighting. They must be trained intensively in all kinds of situations in order to be able to always outmanoeuvre the enemy. If we learn them to become true heroes of dogfighting, our Air Force will become formidable through the sheer quality of our pilots alone."
 CEN_DEM_Read_The_Tide_of_Battle: "장거리 탐지"
 CEN_DEM_Read_The_Tide_of_Battle_desc: "RADARs are starting to become more and more common with new developments like the Decimetric radar allowing for a more accurate tracking of aerial objects in a determined airspace.

 CEN_DEM_Fighter_Bombers: "전폭기"
 CEN_DEM_Fighter_Bombers_desc: "Our current bomber fleet cannot properly protect itself, and our fighter fleet cannot properly damage the enemy. We must introduce a new type of plane to our Air Force, the fighter-bomber.

 CEN_DEM_Sea_Bomber_Trials: "뇌격기 시험 평가"
 CEN_DEM_Sea_Bomber_Trials_desc: "Our current Air Force lacks the power to damage enemy ships. We need to develop specialised sea-bombers that will be able to bomb enemy ships much more effectively.

 CEN_DEM_Propose_Naval_Ventures_desc: "현재 우리 해군은 약합니다. 따라서 이를 확대시키기 위한 군사적 노력에 집중할 기회를 살펴보아야 합니다. 그렇지 않으면, 우리는 다른 강대국들의 장난감이 될 것입니다. 함대가 있다면 자유민주주의를 무너뜨리려는 사람들로부터 우리 해안을 성공적으로 방어할 수 있습니다.."
 CEN_DEM_Merhcant_Fleets: "상선단"
 CEN_DEM_Merhcant_Fleets_desc: "Our country lacks a formal merchant navy to speak off, and if we even want to consider starting a formal military navy, then maybe we should worry about acquiring a civilian navy first. We shall buy a few transport ships in the world market and then invest in some small dockyards to maintain these small merchant fleet."
 CEN_DEM_Training_Next_Gen: "차세대 해군 장교"
 CEN_DEM_Training_Next_Gen_desc: "Our expanding navy requires officers that can properly handle the crews and efficiently control our ships.

 CEN_DEM_New_Drydocks: "새로운 건선거"

 CEN_DEM_Convoy_Defense_Fleet_desc: "The most important thing on the seas is the protection of our trade. We need to defend our trade convoys and in order to do that we must seek the ships that will perform that task adequately. We cannot afford to spend too much resources on other things."

 CEN_DEM_Military_Fleet_Expansion: "군함대 확장"
 CEN_DEM_Military_Fleet_Expansion_desc: "To further our naval ambitions, we must focus on expanding our military fleet. It is wholly inadequate for our current strategic needs, which means that we must expand it. We must build new military ships to protect our convoys and safeguard our shores."

 CEN_DEM_Flagship_Designs: "기함 설계"
 CEN_DEM_Flagship_Designs_desc: "With our reforms nearly finished, we are in dire need of a flagship for our navy.

 CEN_naval_lighter_desc: "Aspiring to have a great fleet is nice, but not feasible for a nation that had barely a bathtub in the water a few years ago.\nAiming for a trade interdiction fleet, based on destroyers and cruisers will prove easier to build and, most important, cheaper!"

 centro.001.t: "Founding of the Central American Congress"
 centro.001.d: "Socialists from all over the country are coming together to determine the future and foundations of the united socialist Centroamérica! The most prominent are the ones who resisted the hardest against the various military dictators and enemies of socialism, but not all can reach the top as they might wish they can. We'll see in the coming weeks just who manages to make themselves known."
 centro.001.a: "To a new future!"
 centro.002.t: "Partido Nacional Revolucionario"
 centro.002.d: "The Partido Nacional Revolucionario has been founded by Sandino, and is gathering a small group of Guatemalans under his cause, leaving his previous partner Moreno out largely on his own. They desire a unified Central American Identity and wish to spread this identity and the revolution to more of Latin America. Many are calling Sandino a monster for leaving Moreno, who was key in his revolution in Nicaragua in the dirt, but his popularity is still steadily rising."
 centro.002.a: "The splits begin to show."
 centro.003.t: "Partido Maximista"
 centro.003.d: "Venancia Callejas has formed the Partido Maximista. His vision is that of a strong chairman, who leads Centroamérica forwards into a bright future, spreading his vision of socialism across Latin America. With his main and only real base of support located in Honduras, he is seen as an unlikely candidate to actually come out on top in the future of our new nation, but he claims he 'Just may surprise us'."
 centro.003.a: "A very dangerous party indeed..."
 centro.004.t: "생디칼리슴당"
 centro.004.d: "The Partido Sindicalista, led by Agustín Martí, is founded on the ideals of European Syndicalism, created by the Brits and the French. They want to provide a government by and for the people; a safe place for future generations and especially natives, as a large amount of their base of support comes from the indigenous population located within our union. Besides overall native support, Martí enjoys admiration in his home country of El Salvador which sees him as their liberator."
 centro.004.a: "The European model could work after all..."
 centro.005.t: "Partido Popular"
 centro.005.d: "The Partido Popular, led by Silverio Ortiz, wants to take a moderate point. Making sure that people have food in their belly and get the education they need. Seen by some as too moderate, and might encounter resistance from people who believe they don't follow true Socialism. Serving as a Guatemalan based party, they hope to ensure the Maximistas cannot wrestle control even if they don't win, claiming they are a greater threat then the military dictators before them"
 centro.005.a: "A man of the people!"
 centro.006.t: "Partido Popular"
 centro.006.d: "The Partido Popular, led by Rafael Calderón, aims to save his people from a lack of plenty, wants to implement a better healthcare system. To nay-sayers, accusing him of catering to liberals, he says that his unique form of moderate socialism will keep the country intact, running and alive!"
 centro.006.a: "A man of the people!"
 centro.007.t: "Moreno, Lost and Found"
 centro.007.d: "With Moreno being left in the dust by Sandino, Moreno has been looking for a new home in the political spectrum. Many predict he is going to be forced into subordination under Sandino, but others think he could stab him in the back for his betrayal and join the Guatemalans in the Partido Popular. Anything is possible, but he decides to side with..."
 centro.007.a: "He sways them to the Partido Nacional Revolucionario!"
 centro.007.b: "He makes Partido Popular sound quite appealing!"
 centro.008.t: "Calling of the Congress"
 centro.008.d: "Representatives from all over the country have arrived and are getting ready to start the grand debates in a week!"
 centro.008.a: "Let us begin."
 centro.009.t: "Status of Power"
 centro.009.d: "Congress or the Chairman. Some argue that power should never lie with one man, others argue that any nation needs a figurehead, who can lead them during the dark times. After many days of debating, the parties have finally agreed on an answer."
 centro.009.a: "The congress will always remain important."
 centro.009.b: "The chairman is the final factor."
 centro.010.t: "Status of the Army"
 centro.010.d: "An union of nations brings forth a few problems: each had their own army, their own structure. Should they all be incorporated into a singular large force, a professional army, or should they remain separate, a band of militias spread throughout the country and working more autonomous?"
 centro.010.a: "The militias are our own roots!"
 centro.010.b: "Maybe it is time to create consolidated army!"
 centro.011.t: "Status of Industry"
 centro.011.d: "While the industrial revolution is far behind us, we have yet to entirely switch over. Some call for this to never change, and to focus on becoming the Socialist Breadbasket, ensuring full bellies. Others propose a more radical change for industrialisation, arguing that less people need to work in the fields these days and more can work in the factories, producing luxury goods and arms!"
 centro.011.a: "For a stronger future, industrialisation!"
 centro.011.b: "For a better people, agrarianism!"
 centro.012.t: "Status of the Future Elections"
 centro.012.d: "If the people are working in the factories and the fields, they cannot concern themselves with politics, at least, that is what the Maximistas and Sindicalistas are reasoning. Others argue that no matter what, the people must vote, because is them who they are representing. Otherwise, what are they but impostors for the revolution!"
 centro.012.a: "The council is the backbone of the union."
 centro.012.b: "The people are the true deciders here!"
 centro.013.t: "The Maximistas have won!"
 centro.013.d: "The results are in! The Maximistas have proven themselves as the victors of the elections, and have already begun to implement their controversial reforms. With this, we can expect a centralisation of power resisted by other socialist cliques."
 centro.013.a: "Victory!"
 centro.014.t: "The Sindicalistas have won!"
 centro.014.d: "The results are in! The Partido Sindicalista have found itself on top in the congress, and have already begun to take office under Martí. Loud cheers can be heard from those who want Centroamérica to play a larger role in socialist politics and especially from the native population. What comes next however, is yet to be seen."
 centro.014.a: "For Socialism!"
 centro.015.t: "The Revolutionaries have won!"
 centro.015.d: "The results are in! The Partido Nacional Revolucionario has come out on top within our nation, as many seemed to expect. Sandino has always been a popular choice among the people due to his initial success in Nicaragua, and many expect it to be not so different now. What lies next in his political career is yet to been, but many look on in anticipation."
 centro.015.a: "혁명을 위하여!"
 centro.016.t: "The Moderados have won!"
 centro.016.d: "The results are in! Seen as socialist as you can get without entering the liberal camp, the Moderados wish to see the people be the main decider within our new union over petty politicians, along with ensuring their safety and everyday needs be met. Other politicians look on in contempt at what they see as filthy moderates, but today the people are the ones who rejoice."
 centro.016.a: "For the people!"
 centro.017.t: "Deadlock!"
 centro.017.d: "After weeks of debating the congress hasn't been able to make a clear winner. Another vote will have to be held, hopefully now with a clearer result. Who wins the new result?"
 centro.017.a: "The Moderados."
 centro.017.b: "The Maximistas."
 centro.017.c: "The Sindicalistas."
 centro.017.e: "The Revolutionaries."
 centro.018.t: "The Capital Debate"
 centro.018.d: "A new nation requires a, possibly, new capital. We must decide if we want to move our capital to a new location, more fitting to our new government, or if we will stay put. In the end, the new congress decides and their choice left the doors just now!"
 centro.018.a: "San Salvador will do nicely."
 centro.018.b: "Tegucigalpa will do nicely."
 centro.018.c: "Guatemala will do nicely."
 centro.018.e: "Managua will do nicely."
 centro.018.f: "San Jose will do nicely."
 centro.019.t: "Our Funding?"
 centro.019.d: "We cannot rebuilt a country on just promises.\n\nFrom somewhere we must get the funding for our extensive projects. We can open our own coffers, but we have more bills to pay, so if we want to avoid spending even more money, we could appropriate some factories from their owners to give us some more assets to use, however, it won't make people that happy."
 centro.019.a: "We will have to open the coffers."
 centro.019.b: "We can just borrow some factories."
 centro.020.t: "Cater to the 'dirty' Moderados?"
 centro.020.d: "There are some in our midst that think we should sympathise more with the other factions, and try and include their ideas into ours. Others call this idea filthy, and call those who hold them 'dirty' moderates. We could try and be more inclusive, giving us a bit of stability, at the cost at angering the current Moderados, or we could just ignore them and try and expel the people that would argue for this!"
 centro.020.a: "They're called dirty for a reason."
 centro.020.b: "We rule for everyone!"
 centro.021.t: "Finally, Prosperity!"
 centro.021.d: "Our new policies have paid off! Our hard work trying to improve the living is paying its dividend, but we are far from done yet. While we can focus on the whole nation, it might be better to focus on a single state. This might anger some of the states left behind, but will result in larger improvements..."
 centro.021.a: "Focus further on Guatemala."
 centro.021.b: "Focus further on Nicaragua."
 centro.021.c: "Focus further on El Salvador."
 centro.021.e: "Focus further on Honduras."

 centro.022.d: "The work we have done months ago finally pays off. The people in [CEN_prosper_state.GetName] rejoice as we today open the new factories!"
 centro.022.a: "Ah, the fruits of labour."
 centro.023.t: "Sandino's followers"
 centro.023.d: "More and more people flock to Sandino's words, not befitting of a socialist nation...\n\nThey call themselves the Sandiniastas, and have been becoming more vocal in their support of Sandino instead of the government. We must decide whether to stop this in its tracks, or to let him go on and risk this growing out of our control..."
 centro.023.a: "Curb his growth!"
 centro.023.b: "Let him have his fun!"
 centro.024.t: "Resistance to change"
 centro.024.d: "Process does not come without sacrifices. We must purge all non-Hispanic influences that are currently holding us back. There has been some resistance to our advances.\n\nWe could silence them and push through our way, or we could listen to them, and take it a bit slower..."
 centro.024.a: "They will have to live with it."
 centro.024.b: "Maybe we should listen."
 centro.025.t: "Central American Hispanicisation"
 centro.025.d: "Centroamérica has been making worrying strides towards Hispanicisation, forcing marriages to be broken, expelling immigrants and banning any tradition that is not part of the Hispanic culture.\n\nMany in our nation are watching with weary eyes towards the south, and awaiting a denouncement..."
 centro.025.a: "Denounce it."
 centro.025.b: "Not our issue."
 centro.026.t: "The problem up north!"
 centro.026.d: "For too long we, as Centroamericans, have tolerated [MEX.GetName]. Now that they have donned an authoritarian cap, we can no longer stand for that. We must strike soon, for otherwise we might find ourselves at the losing end of a war with [MEX.GetName]..."
 centro.026.a: "We can prepare for WAR!"
 centro.027.t: "Sandino's cult grows"
 centro.027.d: "We have been careless, and the Sandiniastas have been gaining more and more followers...\n\nWe can still act, and ban the organisation, but it will cost us greatly, and anger Sandino even more. However, if we don't, Sandino might get ideas and try and pull even more power towards him self, bringing danger to the revolution.\n\nWe must decide quickly!"
 centro.027.a: "He is too powerful now..."
 centro.027.b: "Let us root him out for the last time!"
 centro.028.t: "The Native Question"

 cenmil.1.d: "Ever since the Federal Republic of Central America collapsed in 1843, there has been no successful attempt at reuniting Central America under a single flag.\n\nGuided by the armed forces of the various nations of Central America, our new Union shall not follow the same path as the attempts during the last century. As the Nicaraguan Revolution has finally come to an end and as the borders between our nations disappear, our Union shall remain a bastion of freedom and liberty, under guidance of the strongmen of the military.\n\nWe, as an union of nations, shall stand united against Syndicalism and everything that threatens our way of life."
 cenmil.1.a: "공화국 만세!"
 cenmil.2.t: "The New Union"
 cenmil.2.d: "Ever since the Federal Republic of Central America collapsed in 1843, there has been no successful attempt at reuniting Central America under a single flag.\n\nAs the disease called Syndicalism spreads throughout the world, even Central America isn't saved. Nicaragua, which has fallen victim to the Internationale's promises, has become the epicentre for Syndicalism in Central America, aided by the Mexicans.\n\nIn order to save Central America from Syndicalism, Guatemala and El Salvador have signed a treaty of unification that shall create an anti-Syndicalist fortress. It is our duty to expand southward, and to destroy the remains of Syndicalism in our hemisphere."
 cenmil.2.a: "공화국 만세!"
 cenmil.3.t: "Opening of the Military Congress"
 cenmil.3.d: "With Central America reorganised and unified, it is now time to choose a new regime to lead us into the future! For this purpose, the militaries of the former Central American states have met for a first session today in the President's Palace in Guatemala City. The Military Congress of Central America will be tasked with writing a new constitution for our Union as well as select ministers and a new President."
 cenmil.3.a: "공화국 만세!"
 cenmil.4.t: "The Economy of Central America"
 cenmil.4.d.yes.martinez: "Ever since the first American businessmen landed in Costa Rica, the United Fruit Company and many other foreign companies and investors have controlled our economies. However, with the revolution in Nicaragua and the political chaos that reigned in the Northern nations, the economy has been severely damage and is strongly weakened. Now that the revolution has been suppressed and that the political situation has stabilised, the Congress needs to decide on an unified economic plan and a head minister in charge of the reforms.\nBoth supporters of laissez-faire capitalism, the AM has suggested Juan Manuel Gálvez and the PU has suggested Aldana Sandoval to this position, while the PN has suggested the interventionist Joaquín Valdéz."

 cenmil.5.d.yes.martinez: "As a newly formed nation, our Republic will need to quickly align itself on the world stage. While we will remain with our old allies in the United States and in the anti-Syndicalists factions, we must quickly take action to establish favourable deals. As the foreign ministry holds large power due to how influential foreign powers are in our nation, the factions are fighting hard to get the position.\nAbraham Williams Calderón is the AM's candidate, Juan Federico Ponce Vaides that of the PU and Salvador Peña Trejo is running for the PN."

 cenmil.6.t: "A new Head for the Interior Ministry"
 cenmil.6.d.yes.martinez: "Despite the major internal threats and problems that the young Republic has to face at the moment, we still don't possess an organised, centralised institute that defends our way of life. As we can't rely on the unorganised police forces of the former nations to handle things forever, we need to reform our interior ministry. The ministry will need a head to run the show, and such an influential position is highly wanted.\nCarlos Hartling runs for the AM, Francisco Javier Arana is the PU's candidate, and the PN has brought forth Fidel Cristino Garay."

 cenmil.7.d: "Anastasio Somoza García, leader of the Administración Militar, the moderate faction of the military congress, has taken to the balcony of the President's Palace of Guatemala to hold a speech in front of a large crowd. As many military men have feared, he wishes to use the fact that his faction is the most moderate to convince the population of his cause, even though he doesn't actively practice what he preaches.\n\nDespite the warnings and threats made by the more radical PU and PN, the speech has also been transmitted via radio.\n\n'People of Guatemala, people of El Salvador, people of Honduras, people of Nicaragua, now we are all people of the Central American Republic. Syndicalists have tried to oppress us, but no more! Our nation is now free of the Syndicalist menace, thanks to the efforts of every single Central American patriot. Now that the holy task has been completed, your voice should be heard, and will be heard!'\n\nOn the next meeting, the military congress was so angry at Somoza that multiple congressmen took to the podium and screamed that Somoza should be court-martialled for high treason."
 cenmil.7.a: "Maybe his ideas aren't that wrong..."
 cenmil.7.b: "Somoza needs to be court-martialled indeed!"
 cenmil.8.t: "Reforming the Army"
 cenmil.8.d.yes.martinez: "The military has been the driving force behind the unification of Central America, but to spell it in singular is quite wrong. Due to the differences between the former nations of Central America, our army is currently a chaotic mix and depending on what nationality you have, you follow different military doctrines and use different equipment. The army currently has none less than 5 different modifications of the Mauser rifle in use!\nThe AM and the PN have both presented plans to regularise and professionalise the armed forces, meanwhile the PU has suggested a major militarisation policy to expand the army as much as possible to defend the union."

 cenmil.9.d: "Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez, the leader of the Partido Nacional, the most radical faction in the congress, has reserved an hour of speech time in front of the congress. Known for his immense hate for Syndicalists and opponents in general, he is most (in)famous for his actions in the 1932 peasant uprising.\n\n'Dear Congressmen, dear men who have let us to victory against the godless Syndicalist, the crusade against Syndicalism is not over! Our Mexican neighbours suffer from an extensive case of Syndicalism, and our neighbours to the south are being tempted into the hands of the Internationale. As a beacon of liberty and prosperity, the Central American Republic needs a powerful, strong and unifying leader to lead us in the eternal struggle against the godless traitors! Our men will fight in the jungle, in the hills, in the mountains and in the cities, and we will never surrender to those who wish the foundations of society destroyed!'"
 cenmil.9.a: "Martinez will lead us to victory!"
 cenmil.9.b: "Martinez will lead us to ruins..."
 cenmil.10.t: "Jorge Ubico holds a Patriotic Speech"
 cenmil.10.d.yes.martinez: "Maximiliano Hernandez' speech has left quite an impression on the members of the congress, however not everyone was happy with his terms and conditions. Jorge Ubico, the leader of the Partido de Unificación, has written his own speech to counter Hernandez', and has presented it in front of the congress, while also transmitting it to the entire Union via radio.\n\n'Central America has been often seen as backwards by the outside world. Our roads have been described as lethal, our nations as corrupt and violent, and our economies as inefficient and underdeveloped.\nNo longer, the glorious Union and shall prove to the world that Central America is the land of the brave, strong and innovative! No longer will we suffer under the traitorous Syndicalist regimes, no longer will we suffer from corrupt officials, no longer will we suffer under division!\nWe need a strong, powerful regime, with a strong powerful leader, to finally reach the future, so to every congressman, to every citizen of the Union, to everyone I say, I will bring prosperity to our glorious Union!

 cenmil.11.t: "Voting Commences"
 cenmil.11.d: "For multiple weeks the Military Congress of Central America has been meeting in Guatemala City to discuss and decide the future of the Union. Speeches, arguments, disputes and bribery have been common place in order to convince (or force) congressmen to join and vote for one of the factions, and the three strongmen who lead them respectively have been doing their best to secure as many votes as possible. The last meeting of the congress will be held in a few days, and it will decide the future of the Union as the new president will be elected to lead."

 cenmil.13.d: "An One-Party State, as the name implies, has to be dominated and controlled by a single party. It will be an easy task to get rid of the democratic and syndicalist opposition, however the other military factions will not surrender. Now that we have been victorious in the Congress, we will need to get rid of our opponents..."
 cenmil.13.a: "Destroy them."
 cenmil.13.b: "The military sticks together!"
 cenmil.14.t: "Military Rivalries Appear"
 cenmil.14.d: "It seems as that our move to destroy opposition inside the military has left it disorganised and split. Despite careful planning, many brigades have declared their loyalty to their former commanders before the unification has been completed."
 cenmil.14.a: "Dismiss the disloyal brigades."
 cenmil.15.t: "Dedicate More Manpower to the Police?"
 cenmil.15.d: "With the passing of the new, harsher laws, we're now finding ourselves with a dismal lack of police officers to enforce them. While we could draw from our Army's manpower pool to resolve this issue, it may just fan the flames of civilian discontent who may see this as a militarisation of the police."
 cenmil.15.a: "Yes, Dedicate More Manpower"
 cenmil.15.b: "No, We Don't Need to Anger the Public Further"
 cenmil.16.t: "The Civilian Puppet State"
 cenmil.16.d: "The AM has been victorious in the congress thanks to the major support from the population, however now they expect us to fulfil our promises. Betraying them would risk an open rebellion, however Somoza has never actually planned to hand over any power to the civilian population. In order to avoid a second revolution, a civilian state has to be created, while being controlled by the military. However, in order to achieve legitimacy, how much are we willing to negotiate with the civilian politicians?"
 cenmil.16.a: "Lift the ban on opposition parties but only approve loyal politicians."
 cenmil.16.b: "Permit some civilian opposition but only led be controllable politicians."

 cenmil.17.t: "대통령 선거"
 cenmil.17.d: "The people do not seem satisfied by the liberties and freedoms we have given to them, as they are demonstrating in favour of new elections. However, unlike the congress election, the people want to vote themselves and decide their own president. Those demands are quite crazy, but we shouldn't risk a second revolution.\n\nAfter countless hours of voting and waiting, the election bureaus have finally closed their doors and the votes have been revealed to the election commission. There has been no reported incidents of bribery or election rigging... at least none that the military would permit to be reported."

 cenmil.36.t: "Ubico's Inauguration"
 cenmil.36.d: "The Partido de Unificación under the leadership of General Jorge Ubico Castañeda has solidified their position in charge of the Central American Republic.\n\nUbico, now the first president of the Union, has been forced to combat Syndicalist revolutionaries, democratic agitators and traitors in the military, however he has proven his adamancy and his incorruptibility during the times of troubles that now lie behind us. Jorge Ubico, who has often referred to himself as the Napoleon of Central America, has proven to the citizens of Central America that he is ready to 'march towards civilisation', as he had promised during his most famous radio transmission. Crowds have gathered today in Guatemala City for the inauguration of Jorge Ubico, and throughout the Union, the same sentence could be heard..."
 cenmil.36.a: "호르헤 우비코 만세, 공화국 만세!"
 cenmil.37.t: "Jorge Ubico travels the Union"
 cenmil.37.d: "As a true president of the people, Jorge Ubico has announced today that he will be travelling across Central America, visiting every larger and smaller city as well as the beautiful country sides of the Union. He will be crossing the Union by car and plane, in order to be able to meet as many citizens of the Republic and to so that he can see every corner of our beautiful union. He will be leaving today for Quetzaltenango, after which he will continue to the disputed region of Belize. Along his route, which has been published in all major newspapers of the Union, crowds of cheerful and loyal citizens have gathered in order to see and meet the president personally."
 cenmil.37.a: "Onwards!"
 cenmil.38.t: "Jorge Ubico arrives in Belize"
 cenmil.38.d: "On the second destination of his tour of the Republic, Jorge Ubico has arrived in Belize City.\n\nBelize, a former British colony under control of Guatemala and later the Central American Republic since the collapse of the British Empire, has remain a claim of the West Indies Federation, despite being no longer under British control for almost two decades. Jorge Ubico's visit, which was greeted with a flood of Republican flags, proves that the people of Belize truly feel as a part of the Union, and not part of the rotten federation across the sea.\n\nThe next destination is the Honduran border city of San Pedro Sula, which now is the main Atlantic port of Central America."
 cenmil.38.a: "Ubico truly unites our Republic."
 cenmil.39.t: "Jorge Ubico crosses the Honduran country side"
 cenmil.39.d: "Honduras, the former bastion against the Syndicalist traitors of Nicaragua, has suffered under the status of frontier against an hostile force. The country side is the home to much of the poor population of Honduras, who can just keep themselves over water with the little they have. Jorge Ubico, who is currently travelling from San Pedro Sula towards Matagalpa, Nicaragua, has taken a major detour to visit as much of rural Honduras as possible. No matter where he arrives, the commonly illiterate citizens greet him with the utmost respect and hospitality, waving the Republican flag along his route. Jorge Ubico has promised to aid every man, woman and child of Central America, no matter their social class or rank, and has kept his promise along the way. By listening to the needs and demands of the common man, Ubico has gained much popularity in the country side, which will aid him in his 'march towards civilisation'."
 cenmil.39.a: "How could anyone not support Ubico?"
 cenmil.40.t: "Syndicalist traitors attack Ubico!"
 cenmil.40.d: "On route towards Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, a group of Syndicalist traitors and terrorists have attempted to ambush Ubico, and end the life of our great president!\n\nLuckily, the Syndicalists, just like their ideology, were not smart enough to cover up their plans, and have been discovered by brave loyalists! As the group of traitors was preparing to ambush the president's car using multiple French rifles, loyalist police forces have overwhelmed and arrested the terrorists. Jorge Ubico and his companions have not been present during the combat between the loyalists and traitors, and as such have not been hurt.\n\nDespite the risks that Ubico has taken, travelling in an open top car through the homeland of Central American Syndicalism, no threatening attacks have happened so far."
 cenmil.40.a: "Good Riddance."
 cenmil.41.t: "Jorge Ubico crosses El Salvador by train"
 cenmil.41.d: "The railway, the symbol of the industrialisation and of westernisation, only passes through limited parts of Central America. One of the largest tracks are located in El Salvador, connecting the ports of Acajutla and Cutuco and passing through San Salvador and San Miguel. Today, a special train has carried Jorge Ubico from San Miguel to the Salvadorian capital. Stopping in Usulutan, Zacatecoluga, San Vincente and other stations along the railway, at each point has he been greeted by cheerful crowds and the Republican flag. Upon his arrival in San Salvador, he announced that he will be providing more funding and incentives for a Trans-Central American railway, which will also be open for civilian transportation."
 cenmil.41.a: "The railway will be a cornerstone of the March Towards Civilisation."
 cenmil.42.t: "Jorge Ubico is back in Guatemala City"
 cenmil.42.d: "After more than a month of touring Central America, visiting all corners of the Union and all social classes, Jorge Ubico has arrived in Guatemala City. The tour has proven to be a genius marketing stunt, and Jorge Ubico's popularity has increased drastically throughout all regions of the Union. In front of the presidential palace, a massive crowd has greeted Jorge Ubico, who later made a radio broadcasted speech. During the tour, Ubico has promised many reforms, and the people are convinced that he will go through with all of them."
 cenmil.42.a: "Welcome Back!"
 cenmil.43.t: "Jorge Ubico's Statue is completed"
 cenmil.43.d: "President Jorge Ubico, the hero of the Guatemalan Civil War, the saviour Central America from the Syndicalist traitors, will now forever watch the President's Palace.\n\nThe construction of his statue, which dominates the plaza in front of the palace, has been started when the Guatemalan flag was still on top of the palace's flag pole, when Central America was still divided due to the Syndicalist traitors.\n\nHowever now, the beautiful flag of the united Republic is guarding the entrance of the palace, all thanks to our hero, Jorge Ubico. The inauguration, on this beautiful day of June, has been declared a holiday so that all workers, students and intellectuals of Central America have the possibility of honouring our great leader.\n\nThe crowds which have gathered to see the statue are estimated at more than twenty thousand brave citizens, and the Republican flag is waving in every street of Guatemala City on this blessed day."
 cenmil.43.a: "An impressive statue for an impressive leader."
 cenmil.200.t: "Supporting a side in the Civil War"
 cenmil.200.d: "The United States of America have fallen into a second civil war, more destructive than the first one. Central America has always been deeply connected with the United States due to the United Fruit Company and similar businesses, however the military is divided on who to help. Some are advocating to aid the official United States government, while others would rather support the new American Union State. Depending on which side we choose, the victory or defeat of said faction could have severe consequences."
 cenmil.200.a: "Help the official regime!"
 cenmil.200.b: "Support the Union State!"
 cenmil.201.t: "The Central American Republic asks for protection"
 cenmil.201.d: "The Central American Republic has put forth a request to our nation to protect it from their enemies who threaten the integrity and survival of the Republic. Accepting their request would ultimately lead to them joining our faction, however committing ourselves to their defence could upset the already fragile balance of power of the region."
 cenmil.201.a: "Guarantee their Independence."
 cenmil.201.b: "Where is Central America again?"
 cenmil.202.t: "The Central American Republic asks to join our faction"
 cenmil.202.d: "The Central American Republic has put forth a request to join our military faction. While we could receive an additional ally who could potentially control the Panama Canal in the future, the balance of power of the region could be destroyed through such a move."
 cenmil.202.a: "Accept their Demand."
 cenmil.202.b: "Central America is by Brazil, right?"
 cenmil.203.t: "The Status of Belize"
 cenmil.203.d: "Occupied during the British Revolution of 1925, British Honduras, or as it is now known as Belize, has been part of Guatemala ever since. Now that Guatemala has evolved into the Central American Republic, Belize remains a part of our nation. However, the British, better said the West Indies Federation, still claim Belize as a rightful part of their nation, which renders the full integration of Belize impossible. Our only possibility to set up ties with the Entente is to return the land, but this would severely hurt our international prestige. Keeping will however forever lock us from the Entente."
 cenmil.203.a: "Return Belize."
 cenmil.203.b: "Offer a Deal to the Federation."
 cenmil.204.t: "Central America demands that we revoke our Belizean claim"
 cenmil.204.d: "The Central American government has sent us a deal concerning the former colony of Belize. They demand that we renounce our claim on Belize and recognise its ownership by Central America, and in exchange our two nations will sign favourable trade deals to revive business ties."
 cenmil.204.a: "Accept the Deal."
 cenmil.204.b: "Crazy and unacceptable terms!"
 cenmil.205.t: "The Federation has refused our terms!"
 cenmil.205.d: "The West Indies Federation have refused to revoke their claim on Belize and have called our terms crazy and unacceptable!"
 cenmil.205.a: "Back off and maintain the Status-Quo."
 cenmil.205.b: "Place an Embargo on the Federation!"
 cenmil.206.t: "Central America embargoes us!"
 cenmil.206.d: "Angry about our adamant position concerning the status of Belize, the Central American government has placed an embargo against us! They have promised to improve trade ties, but now they have made the opposite. While this will hurt both of our economies, giving in now would be a political humiliation."
 cenmil.206.a: "We will have to accept their terms."
 cenmil.206.b: "What is there even to trade with Central America?"
 cenmil.207.t: "The Federation has cut all ties with us!"
 cenmil.207.d: "The West Indies Federation has ignored our warnings, and is now ignoring our embargo! It seems like the dispute over Belize will never end..."
 cenmil.207.a: "Maintain the Embargo."
 cenmil.208.t: "The Federation has revoked their claim!"
 cenmil.208.d: "The West Indies Federation has finally accepted to revoke their claims on Belize, which will open the path for its full integration."
 cenmil.208.a: "Great!"
 cenmil.209.t: "Our request has been accepted"
 cenmil.209.d: "We have secured the guarantee we have requested and now are protected from the enemies of the Republic."
 cenmil.209.a: "Great!"
 cenmil.210.t: "Our request has been denied"
 cenmil.210.d: "We have failed to secure the guarantee we have requested and now remain alone against the enemies of the Republic."
 cenmil.210.a: "Disappointing."
 cenmil.211.t: "Our request has been accepted"
 cenmil.211.d: "We have been formally accepted into the faction and can now participate in the international crusade against Syndicalism!"
 cenmil.211.a: "Great!"
 cenmil.212.t: "Our request has been denied"
 cenmil.212.d: "We have not been accepted into the faction, but we will continue our struggle against Syndicalism on our own."
 cenmil.212.a: "Disappointing."
 cenmil.220.t: "The Status of the IRCA"
 cenmil.220.d: "The International Railways of Central America, short IRCA, has held the monopoly on rail transportation and the ownership of most railway tracks in Central America since 1912. The IRCA, now part of the United Fruit Company, will be a major partner or obstacle in our quest to lay the railway from Guatemala to Panama. Previous Guatemalan administrations have signed various deals with the IRCA, and it is now up to us if we respect these signatures or break the deals in favour of a state-controlled railway."
 cenmil.220.a: "Grant them a monopoly as long as they follow our orders."
 cenmil.220.b: "Respect the previous deals."
 cenmil.220.c: "Nationalise the IRCA."
 cenmil.221.t: "The Planning of the Railway"
 cenmil.221.d: "Building a railway across the harsh terrain of Central America is not an easy task, and a proper railway suited for all kinds of transportation needs will be very expensive. As the Trans-Central American railway is a major prestige project for the government, some advocate that the government takes over the entire cost of the railway. While very costly, that would also guarantee state control of the rails. At the same time, foreign investors are also interested in the construction of the railway and could take over part of the costs."

 CENmil_screens: "보조함"
 CENmil_screens_desc: "One of the steps towards establishing a new navy would be to establish a functional escort fleet, which is capable of defending our trade routes from rogue submarines in case of war. It will also help down the line when we can field larger ships, as the escorts are as vital to a large surface fleet as the very flagship. Since we lack any sort of dockyards in our nation, our best option to establish a fleet fast will be to acquire foreign screen ships until we can establish dockyards of our own."

He claims he will finance the expedition with his personal wealth all on his own, and they just need us to give them the green light. [Root.GetLeader] has already announced his support for the project, and has contacted the Dueñas family personally to ask for their lands to be visited by the expedition. After a meeting with both a representative of the Dueñas family, Dimmick and [Root.GetLeader], they have agreed to give a carte blanche to the expedition at the dig site until the end of May, with the coming of the rain season.
