 URG_continue_council_rule: "평의회의 최고권위 유지"
 URG_continue_council_rule_desc: "1918년 발타사르 브룸의 노력으로 우리는 마침내 의회정치의 개혁을 마칠 수 있었습니다. 이것은 우리의 번영을 이끌 것이며, 이것을 없애버리는 것은 전 세계적인 재앙과 우리 파벌들 사이의 끊임없는 싸움의 시대로 되돌아가는 위험이 일어날 수 있기 때문에 굉장히 어리석은 일일 것입니다."
 URG_promote_political_stability: "정치 안정화 촉진"
 URG_promote_political_stability_desc: "우루과이는 정치적 불안정에 낯설지 않습니다. 지난 1세기 동안 양당간의 갈등은 우리나라를 딱 한번 분열 시키는 일까지 일어날 뻔 했습니다. 하지만 평의회를 통해, 우리는 양당을 통합할 수 있었는데, 그들은 이제 서로 최선을 다해 협력하고 우리를 더 나은 미래로 이끌려고 합니다. 우리는 이러한 화합을 장려하고, 타협과 협력을 위해 노력하는 모든 사람들을 모범적인 시민으로 만들 것입니다."
 URG_encourage_political_confidence: "정치적 신뢰 보장"
 URG_encourage_political_confidence_desc: "우루과이 국민들은 선거에서 누구를 고를 권리가 있습니다. 하지만, 많은 사람들은 여전히 그들이 결과에 아무런 영향을 미치지 않을 것이라고 믿거나, 심지어 선거에 대해 전혀 알지 못하기에 투표를 하지 않고 있습니다. 정치 참여에 대한 자신감을 고취 시키고, 안정을 북돋우도록 노력해야 합니다."

 URG_power_to_the_council_desc: "이제 위기의 대처가 끝났으니, 그 전에 가졌던 쟁점으로 돌아갈 수 있습니다. 평의회의 존재는 필수적인 것으로 증명 되었고, 그것은 대중의 많은 지지를 얻게 했습니다. 평의회가 대통령 보다 더 쓸모 있는 것으로 판정 났으므로, 우리는 대통령이 갖고 있던 모든 행정 기능을 평의회에게로 이전하고자 합니다."
 URG_begin_council_policy: "공동복구계획 발표"
 URG_begin_council_policy_desc: "평의회는 마침내 정계를 안정 시켰고, 이제 위기 이전의 정책을 다시 시행할 때가 되었습니다."
 URG_restore_presidentialism: "대통령직 부활"
 URG_restore_presidentialism_desc: "발타사르 브룸의 대통령 취임 이후 실질적인 권력은 대통령이 아닌 평의회에 의해 장악 되었었습니다. 너무 오랫동안 의회는 국가를 절대적으로 지배해 왔고, 대통령의 권한은 휴지 조각 만도 못한 허수아비 직으로 추락 했습니다. 이제는 국가의 이익을 위해 대통령의 권력을 되찾아야 할 때이며, 그 역할에 맞는 사람은 가브리엘 테라 뿐 입니다."
 URG_expand_presidents_power: "대통령 권한 확대"
 URG_expand_presidents_power_desc: "With the Constitutional Reform that went into effect in 1919, the presidency had to share most of its power with the National Council of Administration. While this did work at the time, now we need to take decisive action, which cannot happen with the constant infighting in the Council, and as such we need to expand the president's power."
 URG_encourage_political_participation: "정치 참여 장려"
 URG_encourage_political_participation_desc: "One of the major fears with the loss of the council is the lack of representation for opposing parties. However, we shall prove to them that there is nothing to fear. The local municipalities will hold a large amount of autonomy, and referendums shall be scheduled regarding a few social policies in order to appease the people and prove we are not tyrants."
 URG_stabilise_the_nation: "국가 안정화"
 URG_stabilise_the_nation_desc: "With the economic recession afoot and the dissolution of the council, strikes and riots fill our streets, and criminals feel emboldened to realise their heinous activities.

 URG_moderates_in_power_desc: "평의회는 출범 이후 안정을 보장하기 위해 우루과이의 양대 정당간 타협을 이루어 왔으며, 오늘날에도 유리한 이점을 두고 싸우는 양당 간의 타협점을 찾기 위해 평의회가 다시 한번 필요하다는 것을 보여줍니다. 바라건데, 양당간의 새로운 타협이 만들어 지면서, 새로운 우루과이가 이전보다 더 잘 진전될 수 있기를 바랍니다."
 URG_compromise_between_sides: "합의의 정치"
 URG_compromise_between_sides_desc: "우루과이는 단일 계층 또는 정당에 의해 만들어 지지 않습니다. 우루과이는 모든 사람을 위한 것이며, 정책을 최종적으로 의결 될때 논의되는 시간이 지금 보다 짧을 수 있도록 양당의 타협에 최대한 힘써야 한다는 것도 이 이유 때문 입니다."
 URG_balanced_budget: "예산 조정"
 URG_balanced_budget_desc: "평의회가 가까스로 동의한 것은 정부 예산에 관한 것입니다. 콜로라도 당은 투자 확대를 주장해 왔지만, 국민당은 과도한 지출이 또 다른 경제 위기로 이어질 것을 우려해 반대의 입장을 나타내고 있었습니다. 이 둘은 결국 남아있는 예산에 한정해 콜로라도 당이 주장하는 투자에 대한 비용을 지불할 수 있도록 타협 했습니다."
 URG_ensure_stability: "정치적 안정성 보장"
 URG_ensure_stability_desc: "우리 나라의 정치 파벌들이 우리 정부에 발언권을 가지고 있는 상황에서, 그들에게 행정력을 천천히 부여하는 것과 함께, 우리나라를 분열 시켰던 분열의 마지막 끝을 조금씩 메우는 것으로, 우리는 한 민족으로서의 미래를 기대할 수 있습니다."
 URG_new_elections: "새로운 선거"
 URG_new_elections_desc: "While originally the council bipartisanship was established in order to provide political stability to the country, the collapse after the Black Monday crisis clearly showed us we need to rethink our administration, and that it is time to call for new elections. May the best party win the election, and may it bring long awaited stability which our country desperately needs."
 URG_colorado_in_power: "콜로라도 당"
 URG_colorado_in_power_desc: "사회민주적인 콜로라도 당은 지난 수십년간 우루과이의 주요 정당 이였고, 그들이 과반수의 권력을 장악하고 있기 때문에, 그들은 이제 그들의 정책을 실행하기 위해 나아갈 것입니다."
 URG_agricultuaral_council: "농업개발청"
 URG_agricultuaral_council_desc: "우루과이가 다시 일어섰으니 과거의 실수를 막기 위한 조치를 취해야 합니다. 가장 큰 타격을 받은 분야 중 하나는 농업 분야 인데, 우리는 이를 타개 하기 위해 OPYDA(농업개발청)를 설치해 이 문제를 이곳에 집중하기로 결정 했습니다."
 URG_new_farming_methods: "현대식 농업 기구 배부"
 URG_new_farming_methods_desc: "최근에 새로운 농업법이 연구되었고, 그것들이 매우 효과적이라는 것이 입증 되었습니다. 수출을 늘리려면 우루과이의 모든 농민들에게 이를 홍보하기 위해 움직여야 합니다."
 URG_people_over_money: "부의 재분배 계획"
 URG_people_over_money_desc: "One of the main tenets of the Colorado party is and has always been 'To make the rich a bit less rich in order to make the poor a bit less poor'. With this idea in mind and our reforms finally coming along, we can finally start our wealth redistribution policies, so we can have a better and more equal Uruguay."
 URG_nacional_in_power: "국민당"
 URG_nacional_in_power_desc: "우루과이 정부 창설 이후 존재해 온 국민당은 마침내 콜로라도 당을 물리 쳤고, 따라서 그들은 이제 그들의 정책을 실행하기 위해 나아갈 것입니다."
 URG_attract_foreign_investment: "외국 투자 유치"
 URG_attract_foreign_investment_desc: "Uruguay is a nation in development. The Uruguayan land is fertile, our ports are great and capable, and we have plenty of room to expand industrial parks. The only thing we lack is money to invest in said areas, and as such we should try to incentivise foreign investment to improve our economy."
 URG_redo_taxes: "비상과세 폐지"
 URG_redo_taxes_desc: "Now that the crisis is behind us and that we've managed to balance our budget, there's no need to keep our past tax hikes. We shall be true to our word and reduce them, a move that shall increase the confidence of the average Uruguayan in their government."
 URG_school_reform_plan: "교육개혁 계획"
 URG_school_reform_plan_desc: "We're surrounded by giants, that have huge armies and huge industries, so hoping to survive against them relying on numbers is useless. We have to begin relying on quality, and for that we need better education, which shall give us an edge on technology with enough time and resources."
 URG_socialists_in_power: "우루과이 사회당"
 URG_socialists_in_power_desc: "The Partido Socialista de Uruguay has, in spite of having all odds against it, prevailed even after having to be disbanded and reformed after 1921 with the split between the traditional socialists and the syndicalists, who formed the PSiU. We will not move forward towards implementing their policies."
 URG_peaceful_transition: "평화적인 변화"
 URG_peaceful_transition_desc: "One of Frugoni's main tenets of Socialism is that the violence, as seen in France and Britain, is only counter-productive for the workers and the society itself, and as the elected official by the Uruguayan government, he has promised to stick to this tenet to the letter. Time will tell however if his hardline pacifism will truly work to reform Uruguay..."
 URG_improve_workers_rights: "노동권 향상"
 URG_improve_workers_rights_desc: "One of our main pool of support are the industrial workers of Uruguay, who, while not great in number as our neighbour Argentina has, are still a huge part of the Uruguayan society as a whole. However, decades of economic growth has forsaken many of them, forcing them to live in despicable conditions, and it is as such that the president is pushing for new work laws to be passed in order to improve their livelihood."
 URG_support_trade_unions: "노동조합 지원"
 URG_support_trade_unions_desc: "The Trade Unions of Uruguay have played a huge role in our victory, and we shouldn't underestimate their influence. However, they are also extremely vulnerable to radicalise and start heeding the violent revolutionary call of the PSiU, and in order to avoid it, we should woo them to our side by granting them concessions to make sure they won't hinder our reforms."
 URG_big_dam: "린콘 델 보네테 댐 완공"
 URG_big_dam_desc: "The Rincón del Bonete Lake, made possible by the construction of this dam, will be the largest source of fresh water in all of Uruguay.

 URG_dealing_with_black_monday: "검은 월요일 문제"
 URG_dealing_with_black_monday_desc: "The stock market in Berlin crashed, dealing an heavy blow to our economy. We need to take a stance on the recovery plan, but which vision will prevail? President Terra's policy, or the council's combined one?"
 URG_presidents_decision: "테라의 정책"
 URG_presidents_decision_desc: "President Gabriel Terra has proposed to maintain the welfare state that Uruguayans have long enjoyed. This will ensure that although our economy will suffer temporarily - the people’s needs will be addressed. Alternatively, there is a proposal that the government must embrace fiscal austerity and end funding for the welfare state - at least until our troubles are over."
 URG_council_policy_decision: "평의회의 정책"
 URG_council_policy_decision_desc: "President Terra agreed to the council's decision to approach the crisis with a more cautious and organised approach. This will take time, but it will be time well spent, after which our country will be even more prosperous than before."
 URG_end_welfare_state: "긴축 재정"
 URG_end_welfare_state_desc: "우루과이는 이번 세기에 유망한 출발을 했습니다. 처음으로 정치적 안정을 이루어 냈고, 타 국가들과의 교역을 번창 시켰습니다. 현재 우리는 경제 붕괴의 가장 자리에 서 있는데, 우리는 스스로를 구하기 위해서는 복지 국가라는 칭호를 버리고 예산의 균형을 되찾아야 합니다."
 URG_temporary_tax_increases: "임시 세금 인상"
 URG_temporary_tax_increases_desc: "복지국가 시절에는 국가가 사회적 혜택을 제공 했을 뿐만 아니라 세금을 최소한으로 유지하려 했습니다. 우루과이 국민들은 이 제도에 익숙해져 있었고, 우리는 적자를 위해 차마 세금을 인상할 생각도 하지 못했습니다. 그러나 상황이 달라졌기에, 우리는 모든 물건에 작은 세금을 부과할 것이며, 일시적인 조치임을 국민들에게 알리게 할 것입니다. 우리 경제가 다시 회복되서 세금을 다시 하향 조정할 수 있기를 바라길 기도할 뿐입니다."
 URG_shrink_government_involvement: "정부 부서 축소"
 URG_shrink_government_involvement_desc: "이 나라는 우루과이 사회의 대부분의 문제들을 부처를 통해 판별하곤 했습니다. 하지만 경제 위기로 적자가 발생 했기에, 우리는 그것들을 줄일 수 밖엔 없습니다. 이것이 우리의 예산 삭감의 마지막이 되길 바랄 뿐 입니다."
 URG_promote_foreign_business: "외국 기업체 유치"
 URG_promote_foreign_business_desc: "검은 월요일의 여파를 줄이려면, 지출을 줄이는 것만으로는 부족하며, 새로운 이익이 필요합니다. 우리는 농업 무역의 비율을 높게 유지해 왔지만, 외국인 투자는 여전히 저조 했습니다. 우리는 우리 경제 전체가 농업 무역에만 기반을 두지 않도록 외국 기업으로부터의 투자를 촉진하기 위해 움직여야 합니다."
 URG_reform_welfare_state: "복지국가 유지"
 URG_reform_welfare_state_desc: "복지국가를 달성하는 것은 우리의 가장 자랑스러운 업적 중 하나 였고, 그래서 우리는 그것을 그냥 끝낼 수는 없었습니다. 많은 우루과이 국민들은 우리에게 의지하고 있습니다! 우리는 우리 국민을 내버려 두지 않고 제도를 개혁하여 복지 체계를 정상으로 되돌려 놓을 수 있는 방법을 찾아야 합니다."
 URG_fund_recovery_programs: "Fund Recovery Programmes"
 URG_fund_recovery_programs_desc: "We now have a rather sizeable income surplus. Our next step should be to get our economy back on track. There's no shortage of small businesses in our small country, who all have suffered the effects of the crisis, with many being forced to close down. We shall enact fund recovery programmes, that way we can get our local talent back on track and increase our profits in order to continue with further reforms."
 URG_farmer_subsidies: "농부들에게 지원금 조달"
 URG_farmer_subsidies_desc: "우루과이는 대부분이 농업 지역으로 이루어져 있기 때문에, 검은 월요일로 인한 가장 많은 타격을 입은 분야 중 하나 였습니다. 낙농업 및 유제품 기업들이 문을 닫았으며, 농민들은 울며 겨자먹기로 생산원가를 훨씬 밑도는 제품들을 팔 수 밖에 없었습니다. 우리는 그들을 지원하기 위해 그들의 재개를 위한 보조금을 지급하는 것이며, 그들이 다시 정상적으로 복귀 했을 때의 세금은 우리에게 좋은 수익이 될 것입니다."
 URG_gib_smole_business_money: "중소사업체 보조금"
 URG_gib_smole_business_money_desc: "Small business is the pillar of our economy, and of our nation. Providing investments in that field will surely ensure a better and brighter future for our nation, and we could also sneak in some funds to sustain our army even more."
 URG_implement_government_involvement: "정부 규모에 대한 토론"
 URG_implement_government_involvement_desc: "새로운 세금 제도 개혁이 시행되고 있는 가운데, 우리는 이제 현재의 정부 규모를 계속 유지할 것인지 아니면 경제 개입을 줄임으로써 외국인 투자를 더 장려해야 할 것인지를 결정해야 합니다."
 URG_implement_decided_tax: "세금법 검토"
 URG_implement_decided_tax_desc: "이제 첫 타격이 누그러 졌으니, 이제 우리의 세금 문제를 어떻게 할 것인가를 결론 지어야 했습니다. 항상 그랬듯이 그 문제에 대한 논쟁은 오래 걸리겠지만, 우리는 함께 해결책을 찾을 것입니다."
 URG_farmer_policy: "농업의 상황"
 URG_farmer_policy_desc: "Finally, we have to decide what to do with our farmers. Agriculture is the lifeblood of Uruguay, and with the recent crisis and our subsequent delayed response, many of our farmers have been forced to reduce their activities, leading them to have large unprofitable swaths of land. We need to get those back to work in order to increase our profits, but how?"
 URG_implement_recovery_plan: "복구 계획 완료"
 URG_implement_recovery_plan_desc: "우리는 이미 우리 국민의 돈을 어떻게 받을 것인가를 충분히 다루었으니, 이제 우리가 받는 돈으로 무엇을 할 것인가를 결정해야 합니다. 최근의 개혁은 우리에게 상당한 흑자를 주었는데, 이것으로 회복 계획을 시작하는 데 사용할 수 있습니다. 다만 문제는 어떤 방법으로 진행해야 할까요?"
 URG_end_black_monday: "검은 월요일이 끝나다!"
 URG_end_black_monday_desc: "몇몇 개혁으로 우리는 가까스로 예산의 균형을 잡았고, 마침내 검은 월요일의 마지막 문제를 처리 했습니다. 이제 우리는 다시 일어설 수 있고, 검은 월요일의 이전 수준으로 되돌아 갈 수 있습니다."

 URG_centralise_power_desc: "With the Council, a lot of the executive power was delegated to both the opposition and the local municipalities, weakening the grip of the central government just to appease the opposition.

 URG_expand_police_force: "내무부"
 URG_expand_police_force_desc: "In order to keep stability in the streets, our current police force is not enough, but our army cannot go into the cities as they have other obligations to attend to. We will need to expand the police force in order to maintain strict control over our country."

 URG_purge_disloyal_officers_desc: "We can no longer afford to have officers in our army which may prove to be a liability in these trying times.

 URG_new_industrial_policy: "신규 산업 정책"
 URG_new_industrial_policy_desc: "We can no longer trust rural exports to make up the backbone of Uruguay's economy.

 URG_anti_unionism_act: "노동조합 탄압"
 URG_anti_unionism_act_desc: "The Unions are a threat for the stability of Uruguay and we shall try to damage if not completely destroy their influence in the government.

 URG_purge_the_government: "정부 숙청"
 URG_purge_the_government_desc: "The previous government merely stands as symbols of the old bourgeois regime.

 URG_cooperate_the_government_desc: "The Uruguayan government has never really stood for a powerful oligarchy and has provided its citizens with plenty of aid despite not being so called revolutionaries.

 URG_develop_infra: "민간 및 군용철도 보조금"
 URG_develop_infra_desc: "All roads lead to Rome? No, all roads lead to Montevideo! At least in Uruguay that's the case. However, these roads aren't really roads anymore but simple pathways once you reach the borders of Uruguay. We need to improve our road grid."
 URG_industrial_training_scheme: "산업 훈련 제도"

 URG_industrialisation_plans_desc: "우리 농업 경제가 호황기를 누리고 있고, 국제 시장에서 가축과 곡물로 훌륭한 수익을 얻을 순 있겠지만, 그것들로 집, 배, 그리고 소총을 만들 수는 없는 법입니다. 우루과이는 산업화되어야 합니다!"

 URG_maintain_agriculture_desc: "우루과이는 대국이 아니며, 따라서 우리는 독일과 같은 강력한 산업 능력을 갖출 수 없습니다. 좋건 싫건 농본주의를 유지하는 것은 국제 시장에서 경쟁력을 갖출 수 있는 유일한 선택지입니다."
 URG_prosperity_abundant: "풍족한 번영"
 URG_prosperity_abundant_desc: "Our economy reached its peak in these years, thanks to our non involvement in massive conflicts such as the Weltkrieg, or the American civil war.

 URG_engineering_and_entrenchment_desc: "If we were to fight a war, it would be a defensive one, and thus we should adopt defensive tactics. Trenches proved to be a very efficient defensive tactic since the First American Civil war, so we should use them as much as we possibly can."

 URG_commission_new_equipment_designs_desc: "Modern equipment will perform a key role in the modernisation of our tactics, considering how new artillery pieces are more accurate than the ancient ones, and new shells are more powerful than before.

 URG_subsidise_local_munitions_facilities_desc: "We can't just rely on imports, considering how easily we can be blockaded by any other nation, and that means domestic production is a must. We should subsidise domestic production in order to be prepared for anything we could potentially face."

 urg.1.a: "자유가 아니면 죽음을(Libertad o Muerte)!"
 urg.2.t: "검은 월요일의 라플라타 강타!"
 urg.2.d: "During the Weltkrieg, we exported tonnes of foodstuff and cattle products to all sides, mostly to both the United Kingdom and Germany. This continued even after the Weltkrieg up until the 1925 revolution in Britain, when our exports to the British ended almost entirely. Ever since then our economy has grown more and more dependent on Germany's. This benefited us due to the strength of the German economy, bringing years of constant economic growth.\n\nSuddenly, however, our economy has stagnated. Businesses have began to close due to ripples of the Black Monday crisis. Thankfully, our two main trading partners, Germany and Brazil, have continued to import our food stocks and other exports. However, many economists fear that Germany will be forced to end their imports, which will bring a full national crisis.\n\nFor now, it seems the Uruguayan golden age is over."
 urg.2.a: "Oh no!"
 urg.3.t: "Farming Exports Collapse!"
 urg.3.d: "It seems our fears have become reality. Due to the Black Monday economic crash, Germany has been forced to terminate most of our trade deals. Farmers across the nation now have produced far too much grain and cattle products with no one to buy them. This has lead to farm owners having to sell at extremely low prices or just destroy their leftover stock. Thousands of people have lost their jobs, because the farm owners cannot afford to employ any workers any more. It seems what was originally an initial economic downturn has become a national crisis."
 urg.3.a: "Disaster!"
 urg.4.t: "Deepened Political Crisis"
 urg.4.d: "Since the start of the Black Monday crisis, any idea of political cooperation has gone out the window. People throughout the nation are losing faith in our government, and riots are occurring in the cities. Suddenly, more extremist ideologies are beginning to gain an audience with the population, where most people have lost everything. The socialist rebellion that occurred in Argentina could happen here too. If we do not start dealing with these issues, we could lose control of our nation. However, there are doubts as to whether the government is strong enough to change anything."
 urg.4.a: "Worrisome."
 urg.5.t: "The Council Begins Deliberations on Solutions"
 urg.5.d: "The National Administration Council have finally met up to try to discuss solutions on the economic and political problems facing Uruguay. The council have only just started discussing solutions on these issues, even though the initial crash occurred weeks ago. One of the main criticisms of the council is the fact that it has taken so long for the government to even begin to try to solve the economic issues. Critics argue that the crash may not have been as bad had the council been able to respond faster to the problem. However, this is not the fault of any one person in the government, but rather the government structure as a whole. The council cannot react quickly to problems because of the need to discuss these issues for many weeks before finally reaching a conclusion. Some politicians currently serving on the council fear that it is too late, and that the council is on deaths door."
 urg.5.a: "Why must they take so long?"
 urg.6.t: "The Council is called into question!"
 urg.6.d: "After the council announced a week ago that they would begin working on solutions, it did not seem to quell the criticisms of the government, but made these criticisms even louder. The loudest critic of the council is President Gabriel Terra of the Colorado party, who states that the council might be effective in times of peace and order, but in times of disaster, a powerful president is necessary to react to problems as they come, rather than waiting to discuss it with the other side. President Terra has stated that it is time for the council to die, and now we must make the decision. Should we maintain the council, or is it time for a strong president once more?"
 urg.6.a: "Maintain the Council."
 urg.6.b: "Abolish the Council."
 urg.7.t: "Council Maintained"
 urg.7.d: "Even with the anarchy and criticisms against the National Administration Council, we continued the rule of the council, and it seems this has paid off. The violence on the streets has decreased back to ordinary levels, for faith in the government is increasing again. The people now trust that the Council will be able to make the right choices for Uruguay, even if it takes longer than a president would."
 urg.7.a: "Our Democracy Is Strong!"
 urg.10.t: "Socialist Protests Throughout the Nation"
 urg.10.d: "Due to the economic crash that is affecting the nation, the popularity of the Partido Socialista de Uruguay, the main socialist party of Uruguay, has increased dramatically, and have organised protests throughout the nation. They are using the failure of the government to deal with this crash as proof that the council is flawed and needs to be replaced with a socialist system. The socialist message is very appealing to the masses of Uruguay who are currently having to deal with the fact that many of them have lost everything.\n\nThankfully, these are only protests, without violence. This shows that although the socialist message is appealing now, they understand that if they made a mistake, like causing political violence, they would fail to gain any major support or legitimacy."
 urg.10.a: "At least it was peaceful."
 urg.11.t: "Anti-Carlés Rally Held"
 urg.11.d: "A rally has been held in Montevideo, protesting the new leadership of Argentina following the Christmas Coup, bringing Carlés to power. The message of the Montevideo protest is that although Argentina has fallen to a violent dictator, the people of Uruguay will defend their democracy with their lives. The people of Montevideo also fear that with Carlés coming to power, the safety and independence of Uruguay could be threatened by Argentina. Whatever happens in the future, we must try to keep our democracy strong."
 urg.11.a: "Liberty or Death!"
 urg.12.t: "The New Presidency"
 urg.12.d: "With the leadership of the National Administration Council coming to an end, the power of the president is back. The council was slow and inefficient, and finally it has been torn down by those inside the government, in the form of a self-coup. Now, President Terra can begin to solve the issues that the council has left alone."
 urg.12.a: "President Terra is now Head of State."
 urg.13.t: "Uruguayan Neutrality Violated!"
 urg.13.d: "Uruguay has not got involved in a war with another nation for many decades, and the people of Uruguay are proud of their neutrality. However, it seems this neutrality has been violated due to invasion from a foreign power. Now, the people of Uruguay are ready to fight to the death to defend their nation."
 urg.13.a: "Uruguay will never fall!"
 urg.15.t: "President Terra Meets with President Vargas"
 urg.15.d: "President Terra recently had a meeting with Brazil's President Vargas, to discuss mutual trade and relations between the two nations. Vargas has become a controversial figure throughout South America, due to a recent coup he executed to give himself dictatorial powers in what he calls 'The New State'. However, it is important we keep our relationship with Brazil strong, for they are one of the main countries we export our food products to."
 urg.15.a: "Hopefully Terra doesn't get any ideas..."
 urg.16.t: "팍스 우루과이아"
 urg.16.d: "Once again, the world has fallen to war. The horrors of the first Weltkrieg are repeating themselves in Europe, and even here on our own continent, war ravages the people. And yet, we in Uruguay are at peace. The fact that we have remained peaceful for so long, even when surrounded by outside threats, brings joy and confidence to the Uruguayan peoples."
 urg.16.a: "What a good country we live in."
 urg.20.t: "1938 Council Elections"
 urg.20.d: "With the council keeping power throughout the crisis of 1936, it is time for the national council elections. Once again the main two parties are represented; the Colorado party and the Nacional party, and they are the main two options. However, if neither of the parties secure a majority in the council, the parties will have to act moderately and work together in a balanced council."
 urg.20.a: "Slight Colorado Victory."
 urg.20.b: "A Balanced approach."
 urg.20.c: "Slight Nacional Victory."
 urg.21.t: "[GetYear] Council Elections"
 urg.21.d: "Once again it is time for elections in the National Administration Council. Again, the two options are the Colorado Party or the Nacional Party, which may or may not be able to secure a majority in the Council. If neither get a majority, it will have to be a balanced council."
 urg.21.a: "Slight Colorado victory."
 urg.21.b: "A balanced approach."
 urg.21.c: "Slight Nacional victory."
 urg.25.t: "The Council Must Decide What to Do"
 urg.25.d: "The council has two choices as to the initial reaction to the crisis. Either we can push more government money into helping people who have lost their wealth, increasing public support massively, or we can focus our money on recovering the economy, not gaining as much public support but allowing our nation to begin to produce again."
 urg.25.a: "Increase public support."
 urg.25.b: "Focus funds on the economy."
 urg.26.t: "Council's Decision: Tax"
 urg.26.d: "The council must now decide on a tax policy. After some deliberations, there are two main options we can follow. Either we can implement a massive tax increase on all levels to try to get money to fund our future efforts, or we could increase taxes to a lesser degree, and not increase the taxes of the very poorest."
 urg.26.a: "High Tax Increases."
 urg.26.b: "Moderate Tax Increases."
 urg.27.t: "Council's Decision: Size of the Government"
 urg.27.d: "It is universally agreed on the council that the amount of welfare we were offering the people was far too much, which is why this crisis has caused such an issue. Therefore, we must now decide as to whether we still hold on to a large government involvement in peoples lives, or to whether we allow business to purchase some of our public services."
 urg.27.a: "Keep high government involvement."
 urg.27.b: "Allow businesses to purchase government services."
 urg.28.t: "Council's Decision: Recovery Plan"
 urg.28.d: "The council must now decide on a further recovery plan. Either we can fund the construction industry, allowing the building of more factories, or we can give government funding to industrial businesses already working in Uruguay, allowing them to employ more people and increase their production to almost pre-crisis levels."
 urg.28.a: "Fund construction industries."
 urg.28.b: "Fund pre-existing businesses."
 urg.29.t: "Council's Decision: Farmer"
 urg.29.d: "The final issue the council is meeting on is its policy on farm owners. In this state of emergency, we can choose to seize farmland from farmers who are not getting much profit from the land. However, we can also fund these farmers to encourage them to try to get more profits."
 urg.29.a: "Seize non-profitable farmland."
 urg.29.b: "Fund non-profitable farmers."
 urg.30.t: "1938년 대통령 선거"
 urg.30.d: "After Gabriel Terra's self-coup against the council succeeded in 1936, the elections that he promised are now taking place. There are two main options: Gabriel Terra from the Colorado party, or Luis Alberto de Herrera of the Nacional party. However, there is a third, fringe candidate. After the Black Monday Crisis of 1936, the socialist party gained a lot of support from the peasant population. Their candidate, Emilio Frugoni, is up for election, though if he were elected it would be a shocking surprise."
 urg.30.a: "Victory for Gabriel Terra."
 urg.30.b: "Victory for Luis Alberto de Herrera."
 urg.30.c: "Victory for Emilio Frugoni."
 urg.31.t: "1942년 대통령 선거"
 urg.31.d: "It is once again time for a presidential election in Uruguay, and the candidates have changed. For the Colorado party the candidate is Juan de Amézaga, after Gabriel Terra failed to win the Colorado candidacy. For the Nacional party, the candidate is Martín Echegoyen, for Luis Alberto de Herrera decided to not run again."
 urg.31.a: "Victory for Juan de Amézaga."
 urg.31.b: "Victory for Martín Echegoyen."
 urg.31.c: "Victory for Emilio Frugoni."
 urg.32.t: "1946년 대통령 선거"
 urg.32.d: "It is again time for a presidental election in Uruguay. The socialists have waned in popularity in recent years, and no longer stand a chance at winning the election."
 urg.32.a: "Victory for Juan de Amézaga."
 urg.32.b: "Victory for Jose Luis Finocchetti."
 urg.33.t: "Terra Announces He Will Run Again in 1942"
 urg.33.d: "Gabriel Terra has been the head of the nation since 1936, when he performed his self-coup against the National Administration Council during the worst of the black Monday crisis. And now, after winning the 1938 election easily, he has announced today that he will run again in 1942. This has come as a shock to many people, seeing Terra as attempting to cling on to power for as long as possible. Although it is technically legal, most people in Uruguay see it as time for a new president, and fear what might happen if Terra gets another four years. The Nacional Party have denounced the president following this, and the Colorado Party has called an emergency meeting of its national committee to discuss this sudden turn of events, for it seems even they were not ready for this. Terra, however, remains confident he will get another four years."
 urg.33.a: "It is legal..."
 urg.34.t: "Terra Loses Support of the Colorado Party"
 urg.34.d: "Two weeks after Terra's announcement that he will run again in 1942, the Colorado Party have now come out and said that they will not support him in his run, and will instead support his designated successor Juan de Amézaga. This has been met with outrage from Terra's office, but no official statement has been made by the president himself."
 urg.34.a: "Will Terra have the support?"
 urg.35.t: "Terra Announces He Will End His Presidential Run"
 urg.35.d: "In the wake of losing the support of the Colorado party, Terra has announced that he is ending his presidential run. He has said that although he wants to continue his run, he has decided to put the nation and his party first. He has, however, refused to give his support for Amézaga, even claiming that he will be a 'weak successor'."
 urg.35.a: "This is for the best."
 urg.36.t: "Fears about Syndicalist Victory in Argentina"
 urg.36.d: "It appears one of the greatest fears of the nation has become a reality. Syndicalist forces have taken over Argentina and have already started to implement radically socialist reforms over their nation. Immediately afterwards, there were mass protests across our country, the likes of which have not been seen since the Christmas Coup by Manuel Carlés in early 1936. Many people in the country fear that the Syndicalism of our neighbour will spread over to our democracy, and that our borders are not safe from the syndicalist menace."
 urg.36.a: "Danger is ahead."

 urg.37.d: "'People of Uruguay! Our neighbours are not evil, like people have feared. They are hard working citizens of their nations. And although we should be wary of their influence and aggression, a full anti-syndicalist approach is by no means the way forward. We should continue to strive for neutrality and friendly relations with our neighbours, and should remember to avoid dangerous demagogues who threaten democracy and the Uruguayan people.'\n\nFrugoni’s speech was seen by hundreds of people in the street of Montevideo, and it has been published in newspapers across the country. Although many still hold fear of our syndicalist neighbour, some people are beginning to embrace it."

Immediately afterwards, there were mass protests across our country, the likes of which have not been seen since the Christmas Coup by Manuel Carlés in early 1936.

Although many still hold fear of our syndicalist neighbour, some people are beginning to embrace it."
 urg.39.a: "Peace and Neutrality."
 urg.40.t: "Gabriel Terra Speaks to the General Assembly"
 urg.40.d: "The President of Uruguay, Gabriel Terra, has spoken to the General Assembly of Uruguay about the dangers of syndicalism. He has stated that over the coming weeks he will move to try to reform Uruguay to the modern day, stating that our current society is vulnerable to syndicalist propaganda and is in need of urgent change, or Montevideo will fall to the socialism and syndicalism that we all fear."
 urg.40.a: "it is a true fear."
 urg.41.t: "Terra Announces Emergency Press Act in Speech in Montevideo"
 urg.41.d: "Terra has spoken outside the General Assembly building in Montevideo, talking about the start of his new reform programme to 'defend the nation against the syndicalist menace'. The first thing he has proposed is the Emergency Press Act, which constitutes the limiting of public press activity in Uruguay. Many people in Uruguay seemed to have taken well to the act, echoing what Terra says about its necessity to protect the nation from radicalism and syndicalism. However, newspapers have come out aggressively against this, stating that it is 'more of a threat to Uruguayan democracy than radical neighbouring nations'. Voting on the Act will take place in the General Assembly soon."
 urg.41.a: "Maybe it is what is needed."
 urg.42.t: "March against Terra Turns Violent"
 urg.42.d: "A mass protest in Montevideo, attended by thousands of socialist, syndicalists and liberals, turned violent when police had rocks thrown at them by socialists. This lead to a clash between the socialists and the police, with much violence. After an hour the protesters backed down, but the clash lead to the injuries of 12 police officers, 9 innocent civilians and tens of protesters. The PSU has distanced themselves from the violence, stating that the message of the protest was plagued by violence which they did not condone."
 urg.42.a: "I thought we were better than this?"
 urg.43.t: "Terra Holds Speech on the Morning of the Emergency Press Act Vote"
 urg.43.d: "'Our nation is under threat! We cannot stand idle while chaos consumes the people, and threatens the hard working citizens of Uruguay. Just the other day, right here in our capital city, dangerous socialists came to the streets and attacked, leading to the injuries of not only loyal citizens but also to our police force. This is only the beginning of socialist violence, unless I can protect the people from the syndicalist menace.'\n\nTerra held a rousing speech this morning following the protest the other day. It was watched by a massive crowd outside the General Assembly building, hours before the vote on his Emergency Press Act is held. It is believed that he has enough votes to pass the bill, but it could still fail in the General Assembly should these predictions be wrong."
 urg.43.a: "The Emergency Press Act passes!"
 urg.43.b: "The Act fails on the General Assembly floor."
 urg.44.t: "Terra Proposes Modifying the Constitution"
 urg.44.d: "Terra has proposed that the constitution be altered slightly for the current situation, giving the president far more power than he currently holds, and allowing him to bypass the General Assembly if the nation is 'under threat'. He has moved far quicker on this than he did on his Emergency Press Act, trying to get this past the people of Uruguay quickly so as not to produce much backlash. The news has been banned from reporting on this in any major way, downplaying the significance of this if it does not go unquestioned by the General Assembly. Although some in the General Assembly have opposed this, many have claimed that it is necessary to protect Uruguay from the dangers of syndicalism."
 urg.44.a: "The constitution is modified without a hitch."
 urg.44.b: "The General Assembly steps in and stops him."
 urg.45.t: "Anti-Terra Riot in Montevideo and Other Large Cities"
 urg.45.d: "A large riot has taken place in Montevideo today, against the rule of Gabriel Terra. Thousands have taken to the streets across the nation in anger of Terra’s successful attempts to seize more power in the government. Police have tried to keep order, and in some places army garrisons have had to be called in to put down some of the riots. By the time the riots had been put down, hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage had been done, hundreds had been injured and there was even 3 deaths. This signifies one of the first times in years there is such political violence.\n\nTerra has responded to the riots, saying that it is time someone restored order to Uruguay. He claims that the 'socialist' rioters are out to destroy Uruguay and turn it into a syndicalist state, leading to mass purges and more violence. Many other politicians, primarily from the Partido Nacional, are echoing Terra’s rhetoric, claiming it is time for the socialist violence to end."
 urg.45.a: "Order must be restored!"
 urg.46.t: "Terra Moves to Suspend the Constitution Indefinitely"
 urg.46.d: "Gabriel Terra has moved to bring an end to Uruguayan democracy it seems. Many politicians and military leaders have rallied behind him in what many have seen as a self-coup to destroy democracy and to make Terra president for life. There is much resistance to Terra’s self-coup, mainly from Terra’s own party, the Partido Colorado. The question is, will Terra’s self-coup succeed, or will rival politicians be able to restore order in Montevideo?"
 urg.46.a: "Terra succeeds and becomes President for Life!"
 urg.46.b: "Terra's self-coup fails, the Colorado Party replace him with Amézaga."
 urg.47.t: "Luis Batlle Berres Denounces Terra’s new regime"
 urg.47.d: "'A tyrant has taken over in Montevideo. Not only is Terra undemocratic, he is anti-liberal and anti-Uruguayan. We are moving into a time when our nation is ruled by a corrupt dictator, who will silence dissent, and destroy any sign that we are truly a republic in any way other than by name. I call for the National Party to stop aiding him, and I call to everyone in Uruguay to stand up and refuse to work in this dictatorship.'\n\nLuis Batlle Berres, a prominent figure in the Colorado Party, said this today in a speech in Montevideo to hundreds of Colorado supporters. This follows many people in the party denouncing Terra’s continued leadership, and there have been calls from many people, mostly socialists or Batllistas, for Terra to step down and restore democracy. The Nacional Party, who have been working and supporting Terra’s dictatorship, have not responded to Luis Batlle’s speech."
 urg.47.a: "He will learn eventually."
 urg.51.t: "1950년 대통령 선거"
 urg.51.d: "It is again time for a presidential election in Uruguay."
 urg.51.a: "Victory for Juan de Amézaga."

 urg.52.a: "Victory for César Batlle Pacheco."
 urg.52.b: "Victory for Luis Alberto de Herrera."
 urg.53.t: "Agricultural Strike"
 urg.53.d: "Throughout the country, many agricultural workers have not gone to work today, and have instead marched in their villages, towns, and cities. It appears to be a protest to the leadership of Gabriel Terra. The strike was set up by Emilio Frugoni of the Socialist Party, with organisational help from the syndicalist Paulina Luisi. So far there has not been any violence, but some strikers have stated that this strike will go on for days, even weeks if need be."
 urg.53.a: "Let's hope it doesn’t last too long."
 urg.53.b: "The police can break them up!"
 urg.54.t: "One Man Dead after Army Sent to End Protests in Melo"
 urg.54.d: "After tensions continued to rise following the police moving in to end the strike, one police officer panicked. He shot 3 times into the crowd of protestors, injuring 2 people and hitting one man in the neck, killing him instantly. The shots echoed through the streets of Melo. There was mass panic, leading to another 3 people being injured. Emilio Frugoni has denounced the actions of the police, claiming they are 'just as corrupt as Terra himself'. However, the event seemed to have scared off the strikers, for the strike was called off the next day."
 urg.54.a: "Our power is more secure than ever!"
 urg.55.t: "Emilio Frugoni Arrested."
 urg.55.d: "Leader of the Partido Socialista de Uruguay, Emilio Frugoni, has been arrested today by the Montevideo police. He was being investigated due to his dangerous links to socialism, but remained active in anti-Terra activity. A few days ago, under the new anti-syndicalism laws, multiple men were arrested with links to both the PSU and the PSiU, who were rather close with Frugoni. After a few days of questioning, it was discovered that the socialists, lead by the widely popular Frugoni, were going to attempt to overthrow the Terra regime in a revolution. Thankfully, we were able to discover this plot early on, before anything could come of it. Without Frugoni leading the PSU, they are sure to lose much popularity."
 urg.55.a: "Excellent."
 urg.60.t: "Shots Across the Río de la Plata"
 urg.60.d: "Since the Christmas Coup of 1935, sketchy and contradictory reports have emerged from Argentina regarding the status of its government. But now citizens in the South have been able to witness first hand sporadic fighting taking place in the Buenos Aires Capital region. Military observers and the navy have flocked to the area and began reconnaissance to ascertain the exact situation."
 urg.60.a: "Troubling."
 urg.61.t: "The Future of the Rio-Montevideo Mission"
 urg.61.d: "For a year, Brazilian military advisors have been working with our forces and high command though the lease on their services is set to expire. The Brazilian government has offered an extension of the military mission for another year though this is not an entirely charitable act. In exchange for continuing the lease they have requested a lump sum of monies be paid for their service though of course we could simple renege on this and end the mission."
 urg.61.a: "Extend the lease!"
 urg.61.b: "We can't afford it."
 urg.62.t: "Brazil Collapses into civil war!"
 urg.62.d: "Brazil, our northern neighbour, has collapsed in yet another civil war in less than ten years, which means trouble for us. First of all, we have to hope that a friendly government comes out on top of the war, and we also have to expect that whoever comes out on top of the civil war will be friendly towards us. Our small military can't intervene in such a large-scale conflict, and the only thing we can do is prepare for whatever will come."
 urg.62.a: "Bugger."
 urg.63.t: "Construction of the Dam"
 urg.63.d: "With the construction of the Rincón del Bonete Dam our country will finally have access to a large swath of water, an artificial one, which will be incredibly helpful both for our agrarian economy and also as a source of electricity via hydroelectric production. This is truly a day worth remembering for our country."
 urg.63.a: "Nice."
 urg.64.t: "The Question of Argentine Aggression"
 urg.64.d: "Argentina is looking very dangerous, and we could approach the government in Montevideo with a proposal: a mutual defence union between our nations in order to contain the Argentinean aggression. It's a risky move, but we're certain we will be able to convince our southern neighbours that we both can only get advantages from this."
 urg.64.a: "Send the request."
 urg.64.b: "Uruguay! How many divisions do they have?"
 urg.65.t: "International Protection Achieved"
 urg.65.d: "We have now joined Brazil's faction, and while this means that we will get dragged in any war our faction leader will get involved with, at least we have achieved international protection. Our own independence is guaranteed."
 urg.65.a: "Very good."
 urg.66.t: "The Formation of the Montevideo Treaty"
 urg.66.d: "Today, in Montevideo, a formal agreement of mutual defence and assistance has been signed between [Root.GetLeader] and [BRA.GetLeader] in case of aggression from any foreign power. This agreement will only strengthen the bond between our two nations, and protect both of us from any foreign invader."

He became deputy for that party in 1916 and 1920, however, with the fall of Britain and France to syndicalism, many of his party became to radicalise, turning his party into the 'Partido Sindicalista de Uruguay', whose advocation of violence forced Frugoni to leave the party he created, and has since then been rebuilding the Uruguayan Socialist Party.\n\nIn his words, 'Socialism is not violence, nor dispossession, nor redistribution', and now that he is in power, he shall respect the Uruguayan constitution and political system while at the same time trying to peacefully lead it to the revolutionary ideals he champions."

 URG_country_intro_content: "The Oriental Republic of Uruguay has, for most of its history, been deeply divided. Even after the end of the Uruguayan Civil War, there was still strong civil unrest between the two main political parties, the Colorado and the National party. No middle ground could be found, and the division seemed to have no end, but the nation was still functional.\n\nWhen the first Weltkrieg struck the world, Uruguay remained neutral, for both Germany and Great Britain were important trading partners. Although Uruguay was able to keep trade going throughout the conflict, the war did not have a major impact on the nation, and Uruguay continued to exist as a weak and unstable nation. That was, however, until 1919, when a new constitution was created and agreed upon by both parties. The constitution allows the Colorado party to keep the role of president, but it would have its powers limited and shared with the National Administration Council, made up of elected representatives of both the Colorado and National party.\n\nThis balance of power has ushered in a golden age for Uruguay, bringing peace and stability to the population. The council had its powers extended even further in 1928, to the point where it's more influential than the president. The council has become fundamental in Uruguayan politics. Due to this political golden age, the economy has improved drastically, allowing the government the ability to establish Uruguay as a strong welfare state.\n\nHowever, the politics of Uruguay are just as volatile as always. Should disaster strike, like the sudden collapse of the agricultural industry, the cracks in the council might begin to show, and some politicians who believe the president must have more power might try to use this as an opportunity to bring an end to the Council's rule."
