 TUR_attract_investments: "투자자 유치"
 TUR_attract_investments_desc: "우리의 회복 계획의 첫 단계 중 하나는 튀르키예를 다시 외국 자본에 매력적으로 만드는 것입니다. 그 계획은 유리한 인센티브를 주고, 주요 해외 시장과 다시 연결하며, 우리나라를 해외 투자에 다시 개방하는 것입니다."

 TUR_a_new_sultan_desc: "오스만 1세의 후손이 우리나라를 미래로 이끌지 않는다면 제국은 그 자체의 그림자에 불과하며 국민과 정치인 모두 이를 잘 알고 있습니다. 오스만 가문의 복위를 요구하는 외침이 그 어느 때보다 커지고 있으며, 임시정부가 새로운 술탄의 보위 계승과 복벽이라는 마지막 과제로 넘어갈 때가 된 것 같습니다."

 TUR_reorganize_ottoman_military_desc: "오스만 군대의 사기는 완전히 파괴되었습니다. 벨트크리크에서 승리했음에도 불구하고, 우리 군대는 세기 초부터 붕괴 직전에 있었습니다. 많은 장군들은 우리 군대를 아랍 반군에 저항하지 못하는 것으로 증명된 국가의 가장 큰 약점으로 보고 있습니다. 우리는 그들을 위에서 아래로 재편성해야 합니다."

 TUR_pursue_the_adoption_of_swiss_civil_code: "스위스 민법 채택 추진"
 TUR_pursue_the_adoption_of_swiss_civil_code_desc: "스위스 민법은 현대적이고 세속적인 성격 덕분에 오스만 인민당 정부가 채택하고 싶어했습니다. 진보주의자들에게는 제국에서 특히 기독교 소수민족에 대해 더 많은 평등을 확립할 수 있는 완벽한 기회입니다."
 TUR_universal_suffrage: "보통선거권 확립"
 TUR_universal_suffrage_desc: "보통선거권은 위대한 현대 민주주의의 주요 목표 중 하나이고, 대부분은 인구 참정권에서 보편적인 남성 투표권이 통과된 후, 이를 전체 성인 인구로 확장해야 할 때 필요하다고 생각합니다. 많은 전통주의자가 연합의 일부라는 것을 알고 있으므로, 이 개혁은 보수 정당들의 분노뿐만 아니라 진보주의자들과 오스만 인민당의 이전 당원들의 이점도 끌어낼 수 있습니다."
 TUR_equality_before_the_law: "법 앞의 평등"
 TUR_equality_before_the_law_desc: "비록 오스만 헌법이 종교나 민족에 관계없이 모든 오스만  집단에 법 앞의 평등을 명시하고 있지만, 제국은 여전히 오스만 관료주의의 모든 부분에서 더 잘 보호되고 충족되는 권리를 가진 무슬림 대다수에게 심하게 편향되어 있습니다. 샤리아에 기반을 둔 메셀은 이 안에서 핵심 기둥으로 서 있으며 진정한 평등이 달성되려면 강력한 개정이 필요할 것입니다."
 TUR_financial_assistance_for_the_anatolian_farmers: "아나톨리아 농민에 재정 지원"
 TUR_financial_assistance_for_the_anatolian_farmers_desc: "최근의 위기와 전쟁으로, 많은 농작물들이 손실되거나 파괴되었고 많은 농부들은 전진하는 전선에서 도망치기 위해 피난길을 택해야만 했습니다. 우리는 이 농민들이 선거 동안 카라베키르의 주요 지지자 중 한 명이었다는 것을 잊어서는 안 됩니다. 그들을 돕고 우리 나라의 농업 경제를 전쟁 이전 상태로 회복시키는 것이 우리의 의무입니다."
 TUR_promote_the_public_school: "공립학교 홍보"
 TUR_promote_the_public_school_desc: "공립학교는 오스만 인민당이 남녀공학 통일령 개혁이라고 부르는 것에서 구상된 개혁 중 하나입니다. 하지만, 이 행위는 튀르키예의 청소년들의 학교 교육과정에 반드시 종교를 포함하지 않고도 과학에 더 가까이 다가갈 수 있도록 해주는 덕목이 될 것입니다. 그러므로, 다른 종교의 학생들은 동등한 입장에서 학교 벤치에 있을 수 있습니다."
 TUR_redistribute_the_lands: "국유재산 재분배"
 TUR_redistribute_the_lands_desc: "비록 사유지 소유에 대한 아이디어가 19세기 동안 오스만 제국에 도입되었고 토지 재분배가 행해졌지만, 제국의 많은 부분은 여전히 국가 또는 직접적인 황실 재산으로 남아 있습니다. 이러한 사유지 보유의 부재는 생산력을 감소시키고, 사람들이 노동의욕을 감소시키는 폭정과도 같은 결과를 가져옵니다. 진보주의자들은 인류가 성공하기 위해서는 자유가 필요하다고 믿듯이, 우리는 이 땅들을 개인들에게 개방해야 합니다."
 TUR_increase_people_politization: "대중의 정치화"
 TUR_increase_people_politization_desc: "국가가 하나가 되기 위한 민주주의를 선언하는 것만으로는 충분하지 않습니다! 카짐 카라베키르는 그에 따르면 민주주의는 최소한의 정치적 지식으로 투표에 참여하는 엘리트들의 것일 뿐이고 대중적이고 문맹인 계층은 관심이 없다고 주장합니다. 이를 바로잡기 위해서는 선거를 위한 인재 양성이라는 취지로 대대적인 선거운동을 전개하고, 각 당의 개혁과 구상을 설명할 필요가 있습니다."
 TUR_more_power_to_the_meclis_i_mebusan: "하원에 더 많은 권력을"
 TUR_more_power_to_the_meclis_i_mebusan_desc: "메질리스-이 메부산 또는 오스만 의회는 바로 민주주의의 기관이지만 통일진보위원회와 오스만 인민당 정부 동안 과도하게 조작되었습니다. 의회는 이제 튀르키예 국민을 고지로 이끄는 책임이 있으며, 따라서 정부와 술탄에 대한 불변의 권력을 가져야 합니다."
 TUR_conservative_majority: "보수주의자의 과반수"
 TUR_conservative_majority_desc: "The conservative wing of the OSP is composed of opponents of the OHF regime. Its leaders are from the Mohammedan Union, however they have sworn to defend democracy, and with the system of minimum deputies established by the provisional government, no party can take an absolute majority against the other two. Refet Pasha, the party's spiritual leader, cheered the victory."
 OTT_revise_mecelle_code: "메셀 개정"
 OTT_revise_mecelle_code_desc: "The Ottoman Civil Code is a true relic of the Tanzimat. Although partly based on the Sharia, it has led to a considerable advance in law. Rather than trying to copy a foreign civil code, we will reform our own. Improving the status of minorities, establishing a secular justice system and a court of appeal composed of a panel of judges from different backgrounds."
 TUR_restore_coranic_schools: "코란 학교 복원"
 TUR_restore_coranic_schools_desc: "Religious schools made private by the OHF should be reopened. Indeed, the Ottoman people, especially the illiterate population, tend to value religion as one of the highest goods. We can therefore deduce that they will have more confidence in sending their children to school despite the fact that some liberals consider such education to be superstitious."
 TUR_give_back_the_goods_of_the_suffi_order: "수피 교단의 자산 복원"
 TUR_give_back_the_goods_of_the_suffi_order_desc: "Sufist orders such as the Bektashis or the Mevlevis, known for their whirling dervishes, are ancestral orders that date back to the earliest traces of Islam in Anatolia. These orders, suppressed and mistreated by the OHF government, should be compensated for this period of persecution. Furthermore, the peaceful monasteries that were taken away from them must be returned."
 TUR_saving_tradition_into_democracy: "전통과 민주주의 통합"
 TUR_saving_tradition_into_democracy_desc: "Islam is a learned religion. For many centuries, Arab and Turkish Muslim scholars were at the forefront of scientific progress. We must now seek to link Islam and democracy, which seems to be an easy task. To do this, some traditional codes need to evolve to fit modern times."
 TUR_use_the_tarikats: "타리카트 이용"
 TUR_use_the_tarikats_desc: "The Tarikats are one of the few organised Muslim institutions in the empire, kept in the background during the authoritarian periods. They were notably a vehicle for vertical social mobility, in fact everyone, from a simple peasant to the sultan himself, could be a member of a Tarikat. In addition, they used educational and social roles. By installing them in the provinces, we can use them for political and social purposes."
 TUR_redistribute_the_zakat: "자카트 재분배"
 TUR_redistribute_the_zakat_desc: "The Sultan is the head of state and of religion. The charity of Zakât al Maal, which is paid annually by Muslims, must be returned to the state. Thereafter, the state will form redistribution colleges, that will work in collaboration with imams and muftis in order to distribute the wealth in the best possible way in accordance with the Islamic virtues."
 TUR_imperial_legacy_secured: "제국의 유산"
 TUR_imperial_legacy_secured_desc: "Now that the wave of authoritarian and reformist extremes has passed, we can finally assure that the empire will survive the centuries to come and will continue to evolve at its own pace accompanied by Islam, the religion of progress. For that, we have to thank our Sultan and his evolutionary ideals."
 TUR_more_power_to_the_sultan: "술탄에게 더 많은 권력을"
 TUR_more_power_to_the_sultan_desc: "Sultan Ömer has nothing in common with the previous sultans of the empire. He is not authoritarian like Abdulmecid II, nor is he puppet or defeated like his four predecessors. He is the image of a Turkish Sultan like those who ruled the Empire in times immemorial. Having restored democracy and having saved the empire from a catastrophic situation, the charismatic Sultan must have a role in politics and government that allows him to govern state and religion in harmony."
 TUR_repeal_the_national_protection_law: "국가보호법 폐지"
 TUR_repeal_the_national_protection_law_desc: "Autarky was one of the pillars of the OHF's economic policy, but it did not help the empire to develop sufficiently by isolating it. We must remove all traces of this protectionism in order to better open the economy to the world."
 TUR_protect_private_properties: "사유재산 보호"
 TUR_protect_private_properties_desc: "With the nationalisations carried out by the state in recent decades and the flight of foreign investors during the Weltkrieg, the place of private property seems to be questioned. Let's reassure the investors by proving the stability of the Anatolian economy and by signing assurances on their investments. Even the smallest peasant should be assured that his business will remain his own."
 TUR_develop_the_major_trade_cities: "주요 무역 도시 개발"
 TUR_develop_the_major_trade_cities_desc: "Globalisation is now by sea, and Anatolia is ideally situated in the Mediterranean Sea, at the crossroads between the Black Sea, the Orient and Europe. Many goods and resources from Asia pass through our ports. Moreover, with the seizure of the Suez Canal by the Egyptians, we must seek to compete with them. This measure could bring us significantly closer to France."
 TUR_a_priority_to_foreign_investments: "외국의 투자 우선시"
 TUR_a_priority_to_foreign_investments_desc: "Some foreign companies seek to relocate or outsource to Anatolia because of the price of our labour or our climate. We can use these comparative advantages to develop and enrich our economy."

 TUR_create_constantinople_board_desc: "Stock exchanges seem to be the new factor of exchange between companies and individuals. Despite their failures in the US and during Black Monday, we need to create an intermediary in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to facilitate the exchange between Europe and Asia."
 TUR_anatolian_railway_project: "아나톨리아 철도 계획"
 TUR_anatolian_railway_project_desc: "Anatolia's rail lines, although improved since the Weltkrieg, are still quite precarious compared to Europe and neighbouring countries. In order to develop them, we need to have recourse to foreign investors, just like we did in the 19th century."
 TUR_an_industrial_loan: "산업 융자"
 TUR_an_industrial_loan_desc: "We need to improve our civil industry to remain in the global market. This would improve both the living conditions of our citizens and our economy in general.

 TUR_reinvigorate_the_turkish_coffee_culture: "튀르키예의 커피 문화 소생"
 TUR_reinvigorate_the_turkish_coffee_culture_desc: "Turkish coffee culture is internationally recognised, and our history is linked to it. We could develop our 'soft power' by using the image of traditional coffee while pushing it to a luxury product needed for European trade fairs. Some companies could be used as a basis for this development."
 TUR_world_class_coffee_exports: "세계급 커피 수출"
 TUR_world_class_coffee_exports_desc: "Our endeavours to explore new markets and to bring the entire world the delight that is Turkish coffee have been successful thus far, and the demand for this traditional beverage is continuously increasing. This is something we should capitalise on by increasing the quantity and quality of our coffee production and by fostering the growth of Turkish coffee companies."
 TUR_military_industries_contracts: "군사-산업 계약"
 TUR_military_industries_contracts_desc: "With war, military companies are the ones who get richer.

We need to redevelop our war industry to prepare for the next war."
 TUR_increase_military_budget: "군사 예산 인상"
 TUR_increase_military_budget_desc: "Since the start of the growth period, we can afford to increase the military budget. We will need this budget to recover and modernise the army, be it for defensive purposes or for reconquest."
 TUR_buy_modern_warships: "현대식 튀르키예 함대 창설"
 TUR_buy_modern_warships_desc: "To defend our trade and intimidate opponents we must invest in warships. The largest ships have proven to be the most effective against regional powers such as Egypt or Syria, which only possess ridiculous flotillas."
 TUR_learn_from_our_defeat: "실패의 교훈"
 TUR_learn_from_our_defeat_desc: "The war against the Cairo Pact was a failure, but some Turks even consider the Weltkrieg a failure. Despite some iconic victories at Çanakkale, Kut and Maraş, our troops were disorganised, and without German and Austrian help we would not have survived. Because we didn't learn from our mistakes, the empire was devastated by the Arabs. From now on, we must learn from our defeats to ensure victory."
 TUR_modernize_our_equipment: "군인 장비 현대화"
 TUR_modernize_our_equipment_desc: "Equipment is the key to our army and the engine of our soldiers. The British General Allenby said \"Turkish soldiers are very brave, they love their homeland and they do not hesitate to give their lives for it if necessary\". Yet what good is bravery if it is in vain? By equipping our divisions with modern weapons and armoured vehicles, we can honour the soldiers who fell on the fields of the Caucasus and the Middle East."

 TUR_develop_turkish_part_of_the_orient_express_desc: "The Orient Express was built at the beginning of the 20th century. Its purpose was to link Paris, Vienna and other major European capitals to Constantinople.

 TUR_cutting_the_euphrates_basin: "유프라테스강 유역 차단"
 TUR_cutting_the_euphrates_basin_desc: "The Euphrates River has its sources in our land. There are no international regulations regarding the exploitation of a river, and we are emerging from an armed conflict with Arab countries. By building and using the hydroelectric power of this river on a massive scale, we could both develop the region enormously and undermine the cultures of our enemies in the Middle East."
 TUR_reform_the_gendarmerie: "오스만 헌병대 개혁"
 TUR_reform_the_gendarmerie_desc: "The Ottoman Gendarmerie was reformed in 1913 by the CUP to combat bandits crossing Anatolia, making it a military police force. However, since then, it has evolved little to remain a force for the protection of the countryside. We need to improve and expand the gendarmerie so that it can once again be used to its full potential and trained to respect the laws."

 TUR_suspend_the_assembly_desc: "의회는 1936년 우리 정부의 붕괴를 야기시켰기 때문에, 우리는 안정적인 정권이 수립될 때까지 그것을 중단해야 합니다. 무스타파 케말 파샤의 야망은 민주주의를 확립하는 것입니다. 그래서 우리는 그의 열망을 믿을 수 있습니다."

 TUR_centralise_anatolia_desc: "우리는 마침내 더 많은 충성스러운 행정관을 배치하고 중앙정부의 권한을 증가시킴으로써 빌라예트를 중앙집권화할 수 있습니다. 이것은 우리가 미래의 개혁을 더 잘 추진할 수 있게 해줄 것입니다."

 TUR_Kemal_will_desc: "아나톨리아를 구했던 남자, 우리의 파샤가 작고했습니다. 생전 케말의 가장 친한 친구였던 이스메트 레시트의 의무는 바로 그의 유지를 기리는 것입니다. 이제 정부는 가지의 유지에 영감을 받들어 새롭고 현대적인 국가를 건설하려 노력할 것입니다. 하지만 아직 반대파는 여전히 강고한 상태이고, 제국은 혼란에 빠졌습니다. 조국이란 무거운 짐을 지게 된 이스메트는 과연 그의 앞에 놓인 과업을 완수할 수 있을까요?"

 TUR_kemalist_principles: "케말주의 원칙"
 TUR_kemalist_principles_desc: "무스타파 케말이 정의한 6가지 원칙은 다음과 같습니다. §g공화주의§!, 민주공화국 건설. §g민족주의§!, 국가의 무결성을 보호. §g대중주의§!, 국민에 의한 주권과 정부.  §g혁명주의§!, 문명을 향한 지속적인 진보의 중요성.  §g세속주의§!, '사상의 속박으로부터의 해방'. 마지막으로, §g국가개입주의§! 국가의 경제 부분 우위."

 TUR_separation_of_state_and_church: "정교분리"
 TUR_separation_of_state_and_church_desc: "케말주의 개혁의 첫 번째 의무적인 단계는 정교분리입니다. 이 아이디어는 계몽주의로 거슬러 올라가며 프랑스와 같은 몇몇 국가에서 시행되었습니다. 이 법의 세속주의 원칙은 국가의 종교적 중립성을 확립합니다. 오스만 제국에서는 국가원수가 이슬람의 수장이었기 때문에 이 문제는 더욱 미묘했습니다."

 TUR_personality_cult: "개인숭배"
 TUR_personality_cult_desc: "It is time to give Ismet Reşit a real place. Although he was not the initiator of the Kemalist reforms, he is the one who is responsible for implementing them.

 TUR_ostentatious_signs: "복식의 문제"
 TUR_ostentatious_signs_desc: "튀르키예인은 유럽인이라면 누구나 알아볼 수 있습니다. 우리의 종교는 남성에게는 페즈나 터번을, 여성에게는 히잡이나 부르카를 착용하도록 인도합니다. 하지만, 이러한 불편한 옷들은 더 이상 의무가 되어서는 안 됩니다. 남성들은 태양으로부터 자신을 보호하기 위해 혹은 단순히 현대 남성처럼 보이기 위해 모자를 쓰도록 하고, 여성들은 숨막히는 베일의 착용을 피하기 위해 그들의 머리와 옷을 자유롭게 합시다. 하지만 국민들과 기관들은 이 개혁을 위한 준비가 되어 있습니까?"
 TUR_protectionism: "보호무역주의"
 TUR_protectionism_desc: "단순한 자급자족으로 나아가기 보다는 시장과 가장 필요한 상품을 위한 최소한의 장소를 남겨줍시다. 이를 위해 우리는 모든 수입품에 대한 기준과 할당량을 도입하고 현지 생산자에게 너무 경쟁력이 있는 제품에 대한 세금을 부과할 수 있습니다."

 TUR_nationalisation_question_desc: "우리의 경제적 성향에 대한 문제는 오랫동안 논의되어 왔으며 케말은 그 주제에 대해 자세히 설명하지 않았습니다. 당의 핵심 부분은 만약 가지가 유럽의 원칙에 기초한 민주공화국의 설립을 원했다면 이 공화국은 자유주의적 경제의 유지를 받아들여야 했을 것이라고 생각합니다. 하지만, 오스만 인민당의 소수파인 '카드로'는 국가의 안전을 위해 대부분의 경제를 국유화할 필요가 있다고 믿고 있습니다."
 TUR_classless_society: "무계급 사회"
 TUR_classless_society_desc: "카드로주의 정당이 정권을 잡았습니다. 국유화 문제 동안, 그 정당은 국가에 유용한 대부분의 상품과 생산 수단을 국유화하기로 투표했습니다. 당 위기 이후 대부분의 의원들은 카드로주의 진영으로 피신했습니다. 케말과 가까운 극단주의자인 메흐메트 레제프 파샤는 튀르키예 사회가 사회적 투쟁에서 자유롭다고 선언하고 '계급 없는 사회'의 결합을 촉구했습니다."
 TUR_turkish_railway: "튀르키예 국영 철도"
 TUR_turkish_railway_desc: "Kemal was particularly fond of certain tools such as the telegraph or the train. For him, the latter made it possible to improve not only physical mobility in the country but also intellectual mobility by allowing the dissemination of ideas and the improvement of living conditions."
 TUR_turkish_man_myth: "Turkish Man Myth"
 TUR_turkish_man_myth_desc: "The Kadro paper, in its desire to unify the Turkish people, sometimes unaware of their unity, created a model Turkish man. Some people think they mean Mustafa Kemal or even Mehmet Recep Peker. In any case, their notion of the Turkish man is by definition the physical power for work and war but also the intellectual power, will and determination of the Turkish people."
 TUR_turkish_solidarism: "튀르키예 연대주의"
 TUR_turkish_solidarism_desc: "The idea of Turkish solidarism is said to come from the sociology of Emile Durkheim and his French solidarism. Regardless of its origin, it consists of the social accountability of each individual. A child is indebted to all his peers for what they have given him, be that education, values or knowledge. Thus, the Kadro movement bases its interpretation of society from a Marxist-Materialist point of view on the very principle of human relationships in order to analyse history."
 TUR_urban_rural_equality: "Urban Rural Equality"
 TUR_urban_rural_equality_desc: "Speaking of a classless society in reality, the only structural difference in the Turkish population is where they live, which greatly affects their aspirations, income and living conditions. They separate the urban and rural class, the latter being greatly divided. However, they call for the establishment of reforms to improve life in the countryside and achieve equality between these two populations."
 TUR_social_nationalism: "사회 민족주의"
 TUR_social_nationalism_desc: "The social nationalism theorised by Aydemir consists in the total elimination of all forms of class dictatorship, whether proletarian or bourgeois.

 TUR_merge_the_banks: "중앙은행 창설"
 TUR_merge_the_banks_desc: "튀르키예 중앙은행은 은행의 금리를 고정하여 통화 창출을 규제하는 동시에 국제 시장의 위기 발생 시 국가를 보호할 수 있도록 할 것입니다. 수요와 공급의 법칙과 우리 국경 내의 은행에 대한 통제 덕분에 우리는 튀르키예의 높은 인플레이션율을 줄일 수 있을 것입니다."

 TUR_waive_the_ottomans_debts_desc: "19세기 이래로 제국은 유럽 은행과 기관에 상당한 양의 부채를 지게 되었습니다. 하지만 우리는 이제 새로운 정치 체제와 새로운 정체성을 가지게 된 신생국입니다. 물론 이 부채를 갚지 않겠다고 선언하는 것은 국제적인 관점에서 우리의 이미지를 떨어뜨릴 것이지만, 그렇다고 해서 우리가 과거 술탄들의 실수에 대한 대가를 상납해야 할 필요는 없습니다."
 TUR_Iraqi_question: "이라크 문제"
 TUR_Iraqi_question_desc: "현재 우리는 중동 국가들 사이에서 외롭게 고립된 상태입니다. 하지만 우리에게 원한이 많은 이웃국들 중에서도 신생국인 이라크는 다른데, 이는 제국 통치 시절에 이라크가 오스만 정부에 의해 철저히 개발되고 배려되었기 때문입니다. 메소포타미아에서 새로운 친구를 찾을 시간입니다."

 TUR_vengeance_for_megali_desc: "우리의 나약함을 이용하여, 그리스 놈들은 우리 나라의 심장부를 침략하기로 결정했고, 그것이 정당한 그리스 영토라고 주장했습니다. 우리가 힘을 되찾았으니, 그들에게 최후통첩을 보낼 수 있습니다. 그들이 이 지역에 대한 우리의 통제권을 반환하거나, 아니면 그들은 우리의 군사력에 의해 완전히 파괴될 것입니다. 바라건대 그들이 그들의 상황의 절망감을 깨달을 만큼 충분히 현명해지기를 바랍니다."

 TUR_modern_mechanisation: "기갑 연구 예산 증감"

 TUR_redirect_naval_project: "해군 계획 전환"

 TUR_turkish_high_command: "고위 사령부의 상태"
 TUR_turkish_high_command_desc: "The question of the high command still remains unsolved. Indeed, ever since the complete takeover by the OHF, a significant number of members of the high command have become increasingly attached to politics. By creating a law on the status of the high command, by separating it from the government, and by preventing active militarymen from exercising a political career, we will hopefully be able to reduce our army's influence on our nation's political scene."

 TUR_civic_independence: "Popular Sovereignty and Civic Independence"
 TUR_civic_independence_desc: "Civic independence or popular sovereignty is the confrontation between many centuries of Muslim and institutional traditions.

 TUR_unification_and_co_education_desc: "오스만 인민당 정부의 가장 상징적인 법령 중 하나인 통일령 및 공동교육 법령은 우선 공교육 시스템의 창설과 사립 종교학교의 제한, 그리고 무엇보다 극단주의 기류를 피하기 위해 국가가 이맘들을 훈련시키는 것으로 구성되어 있습니다. 여학생들을 위한 남녀공학 학교나 교육은 여성들이 학교에 갈 수 있도록 허용했습니다."
 TUR_Turkish_civil_code: "튀르키예 민법"
 TUR_Turkish_civil_code_desc: "The Turkish civil code will be based on the Swiss civil code, the most modern of its time, according to a committee formed for the purpose.

 TUR_women_rights: "여성의 권리"
 TUR_women_rights_desc: "여성의 권리는 이제 국가의 완전한 평등을 달성하기 위해 정치로 확장되어야 합니다. 또한, 여성의 권리와 페미니스트 조직은 정부와 당의 지원을 받아 발전해야 합니다. 이제 이들도 선출될 수 있습니다. 하지만 아직 국내의 남성 독주가 해소된 것은 아닙니다."
 TUR_family_name_law: "성에 대한 문제"
 TUR_family_name_law_desc: "성은 튀르키예인들 사이에 존재하지 않습니다. 모두 이름이 있고 종종 별명이 있는데, 이것은 칭호일 수도 있고, 아버지의 이름으로 불릴 수도 있습니다. 이 개혁은 모든 시민들이 완전히 독특해지기 위해 이름을 선택하도록 함으로써 나라를 서구화하는 것을 목표로 할 것입니다. 그러나 각 이름은 튀르키예어에서 유래해야 합니다."

 TUR_abolition_of_ottoman_titles_desc: "이제 이름에 대한 문제가 제기되었으므로, 직함을 폐지하거나 최소한 그 중요성과 계층적 함축성을 줄여야 합니다. 이러한 호칭들은 우리가 폐지하고 싶어하는 차별적이고 봉건적인 제도의 반영일 뿐입니다."
 TUR_question_of_caliphate: "마지막 칼리파국"
 TUR_question_of_caliphate_desc: "The final question, the one that every government politician dreads: the abolition of the Caliphate. As Kemal wrote in black and white in the last line of his political testament: the Caliphate must be abolished. However, the measure is not established by a simple sentence.

 TUR_language_question_desc: "알파벳의 개혁이 마침내 확립될 수 있습니다. 이 질문은 탄지마트 시대 이래로 많은 개혁가들의 마음에 있었지만, 오직 케말만이 진정한 옹호자로 보였습니다. 이것은 국가를 현대화하고 문화적으로 결합시킬 것입니다. 라틴 알파벳이 약 30자밖에 없기 때문에, 그것은 또한 이 나라의 문해률을 향상시킬 것입니다."
 TUR_turkic_history: "튀르키예 역사"
 TUR_turkic_history_desc: "우리는 이슬람과 연결된 오스만 제국의 단순한 이미지에서 벗어나야 합니다. 이 튀르키예 국가는 종교가 만들어지는 동안 탄생한 것이 아니라 훨씬 더 일찍 탄생했습니다. 많은 역사가들에 따르면, 최초의 튀르키예 국가들은 중앙 아시아와 러시아를 거쳐 유럽으로 내려온 아시아 평원의 유목민들, 시베리아나 중국에서 유래했다고 합니다. 튀르키예 전사들의 이 영광스러운 이미지를 채택합시다."

 TUR_state_secularism_desc: "State secularism is the absolute step that Kemal wanted to achieve, no longer simply separating religion and politics but above all applying secularism as a watchword for the whole nation.

 TUR_seize_minorities_monopolies_desc: "Since the tanzimats and the Millet system, many minorities, especially Christians, had monopolies on many sectors, both industrial and banking.

 TUR_dissolve_western_influence: "Dissolve Western Influence"
 TUR_dissolve_western_influence_desc: "The development methods of European and Asian countries have diverged in the capitalist era. In order to achieve independence from the European powers, the foundations of liberalism must be abolished. The theoreticians of the Kadro paper believe, like Lenin, that from a fundamental point of view, the national political independence of each colonised country or almost each colonised country would allow the destruction of the capitalist-imperialist status quo."
 TUR_mix_western_populism: "Mix Western Populisms"
 TUR_mix_western_populism_desc: "The Kadro paper is a mixture of European populist and nationalist ideas immersed in a fundamental Marxist logic in the thoughts of the Kadroist authors. However, as Marxism did not allow them to grasp the concept of nation and nationalism, by rejecting racism and imperialism they were able to grant their nationalist principle to this quasi-Marxist ideology. They rejected the national-populist principle of eliminating class through corporatism."
 TUR_total_welfare_state: "Total Welfare State"
 TUR_total_welfare_state_desc: "The Kadro paper argued for the elimination of the private sector from decision-making. They believe that the state should be the one who is responsible for the larger part of industrial investment. Therefore, a planned 'etatiste' economic development would restrain the formation of social classes by consciously bringing about an intellectual 'cadre', which would stand independent from any social class and would consider the national interests as the highest priority."
 TUR_permanent_revolutionism: "영구혁명주의"
 TUR_permanent_revolutionism_desc: "Permanent revolutionism, inspired by Lenin's ideas, consists of the belief that the first stage of the revolution was the taking of national political independence.

This man is Mehmed Recep Peker."

 TUR_recover_from_the_disaster_desc: "The defeat in the Desert War has left our nation in a severely weakened state. We were forced to concede many of our former territories to the Arabs, countless lives were lost and the entire Middle East set ablaze.

 TUR_deal_with_protestors_desc: "Protests from the people have only grown louder since the coup. They are scared, and their fear is understandable.

 TUR_use_the_army: "Use the Army for Reconstruction"
 TUR_use_the_army_desc: "The army is useful for more than just removing enemies of the state by force. It can assist in the reconstruction of our country by paving roads, cleaning up debris and damage, and caring directly for our people. Using the army for such tasks could, furthermore, also drum up support for the regime and serve as a show of force for the new government."
 TUR_fight_unemployment: "실업과 싸움"

 TUR_controlled_democracy_desc: "Democracy at its best allows the greatest among us to guide our people to a bright future. However, at its worst it could be used to undermine the sovereignty and security of our nation.

 TUR_father_of_the_people_desc: "'Mustafa Fevzi Çakmak shall guide our people!', the posters have proclaimed for the longest time now. However, portraying the Mareşal as a national hero does not seem to be enough for the THF anymore.

 TUR_call_for_legislative_elections: "Call for Legislative Elections"
 TUR_call_for_legislative_elections_desc: "Although the THF claims to be the only party needed, it should still be ensured that those who want a multi-party system are satisfied.

 TUR_promote_military_academies: "Promote Military Academies"
 TUR_promote_military_academies_desc: "For the Mareşal, who spent much of his youth enrolled at a military academy, these institutions are the backbone of the army, and should be funded as such.

 TUR_great_military_project_desc: "Part of the weakness of the Empire stemmed from its ailing and poorly equipped military.

However, until then, there is much more to be done."
 TUR_modernise_army_fevzi: "Modernise the Army"
 TUR_modernise_army_fevzi_desc: "Our army has shown its weaknesses in past wars, and if our nation is to survive the oncoming storm, our military must be able to face the challenges of modern-day combat. For this purpose, the Mareşal has orchestrated a series of reforms aimed at determining the status of our army and its specialisation, and at improving its overall capabilities."
 TUR_a_revanchist_goal: "A Revanchist Goal"
 TUR_a_revanchist_goal_desc: "When we were forced to sign the peace treaty following the Desert War on what had been Turkish territories for centuries, our foes probably expected us to stay down and to abandon any expansionist ambitions in the near future.

In his testament, Kemal wrote down all of the wishes he had for the new Turkish state. His reforms are based on six fundamental principles: republicanism, nationalism, populism, secularism, revolutionism and statism. However, Kemal's will is complex, extremist and deeply anti-religious. He would have liked the total separation of church and state and had even darker ideas concerning the Padishah. Ismet Pasha will have to deal with the traditionalist resistance if he wants to enforce these reforms.\n\n Current Traditionalist Resistance: [?TUR_traditionalist_resistance|%%R]\n\nHowever, if we could convince the people of our good intentions or if we were to make some concessions to the traditionalists, we should be able to reduce their resistance."

 TUR_question_of_iskanderun_desc: "For over 400 years now, Iskenderun, also known as Alexandretta, has been a part of our nation. Because of its proximity to Anatolia, the heartland of the Turkish people, it steadily became more and more integrated into the Turkish culture, resulting in the population of the region nowadays mostly consisting of Turks. However, this didn't stop the pesky Syrians from stealing the province in our moment of weakness. Since the wounds our nation had obtained during the Desert War were still fresh and a long way from being healed at the time, we were unable to do anything about this treachery.\n\nNow that the situation in our country has somewhat stabilised, we can once again focus on Alexandretta, where our Turkish brethren are still being oppressed by the Syrians. It is our duty to use any resources necessary to ensure that the province gets returned to its righteous owner. Once our influence over the region is high enough, the Syrians might be forced to admit that they've made a mistake when they took over Iskenderun, which would result in them restoring our rule over the province. However, they could also try to hold on to the region, which would in return force us to take more aggressive measures.\n\nOur Influence in Iskenderun: [?influence_adana|%%Y]\n"

 TUR_relation_with_iraq_desc: "Among the new Arab states born in the wake of the Desert War was the young nation of Iraq. Unlike the other Arabs, who felt mistreated under our rule, the people of Iraq were more or less content with their situation in the Empire. This can be traced back to the interest the Porte had in the Iraqi oil fields and the strategic situation of Iraq on the Persian border, two factors that led to the Porte focusing its development efforts not just on Anatolia but on Iraq as well. Sadly, the thoughts of Arab nationalism managed to spread to the region regardless, resulting in its secession from the Empire.\n\nHowever, it may be a wise idea to accept this development. If we were to reestablish diplomatic relations with Iraq and renounce our claims on their territory, we might be able to make a new friend not too far from our home country, which is worth far more than one might think. Seeing how the Persians are eyeing up the Iraqi lands, the government of Iraq would surely also be glad to gain a new ally in these trying times."

Even though we were able to crush these revolts using our sheer military might, the stubbornness of the Kurdish people prevented us from centralising their lands. However, it should also be noted that the Kurdish people are by no means united. Their lands are split between many tribes with varying interests. The only thing that most of them can agree on is the fact that, from their point of view, Kurdistan would be better off without the Turks.\n\nOur defeat in the Desert War has once again rekindled the rebellious and nationalist sentiments of the Kurds. Seeing our army being beaten gave them new hope. Now they see their time to strike. The Chiefs of the different tribes are starting to settle their disputes, the people are beginning to arm themselves and the resistance movements are growing stronger by the day.\n\nCurrent Kurdish Unrest: [?TUR_kurdish_unrest_value|R0%%]\n§R(A revolt will happen if unrest reaches [?TUR_kurdish_revolt_threshold?100|R0%%])§!"

 tur.0.d: "Whilst we entered the Desert War proud and confident in our abilities to show the backstabbing Arab rebels their place, we were soon forced to accept that this war was too much for our Empire to handle. Our inability to fend off the deceitful Arab coalition has resulted in our once glorious Empire being reduced to nothing but a rump state. The Levant has been lost, and with it the last bit of prestige our nation and our Sultan still had in the eyes of the wider world. The holy cities will no longer prosper under our rule, the rich territories of Syria and Iraq have been devastated and have fallen into the hands of our enemies, and the Jewish communities in Palestine that once relied on the protection of the Porte now find themselves in an isolated and vulnerable state.\n\nCountless refugees, mainly of Turkish descent, have begun their journey from our lost territories back to their homeland of Anatolia, hoping that they'd be better off within our borders. However, it's not just those in the territories we have lost that are suffering - the people of Anatolia too are experiencing extreme hardships. Many have lost their loved ones, the economy lies in shambles, and a general feeling of discontent is spreading among the populace. It will take some time to rebuild what has been destroyed, but it seems unlikely that the people are going to be patient enough to wait for our government to sort things out. They feel betrayed by the ruling politicians, and have lost all trust not only in the ruling party, but also in [TUR.GetLeader] and his abilities. We can only hope that the situation soon changes for the better..."
 tur.0.a: "What has become of our Empire?"
 tur.1.t: "The Abdication of Abdulmecid II"
 tur.1.d: "The debacle of the Empire has come to an end. The storm has finished blowing and the dust has settled. The Ottoman Empire reveals itself as a victim of the unjust treaty imposed by the Cairo Pact, which saw the end of the century-long Ottoman hegemony in the Middle East. The people that had fled during the war and in its aftermath have now settled by the thousands in Anatolia, famines and massacres were numerous during their flight. The Turkish troops are disorganised, and many soldiers, especially of Arab origin, have already deserted, hoping to find a more glorious future elsewhere, and the world has lost all respect for our nation. These are dark times for the Empire. Sultan Abdülmecid II watches this spectacle from his window, horrified.\n\nThe government of the day no longer shows its face, it knows what it is getting into. The people are grumbling, who are these politicians that led the Empire to its ruin in the belief that they are reforming it? One gets the impression that external affairs have been disregarded in favour of political conflicts of interest. Everyone is waiting for the event that will mark a turning point in this disarray. Since the Sultan seems to be the only one with power in this decisive moment, many refer to him. Finally, Abdülmecid announced to his aide-de-camp that he is going to abdicate. He had seen the glory days of the Empire after the Great War, but had been unable to leave the puppet function that had been imposed on his predecessors.\n\nAhmed Nihad, grandson of the ill-fated Sultan Murad V, has been proclaimed Sultan of the Ottoman Empire under the name Ahmed IV. He followed the usual ceremony and was elected Caliph of all of Islam by the Meclis-i Mebûsan. He has been enthroned as 'Khalifa of the Muslims and Custodian of the Holy Places' and now wears the historical mantle - to the disliking of many deputies."
 tur.1.a: "May God protect his successor."
 tur_osp.1.t: "The Evening Coup"
 tur_osp.1.d: "This evening at around 10:30 p.m., two armies surrounded [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The first blockaded the main roads leading into the city, whilst the second went straight ahead into the narrow streets of our capital. The OHF government, having been warned of their fate, gathered in the Council of Ministers room and ordered the remaining loyal guards to surrender without resistance. General Refet Pasha, accompanied by soldiers, burst into the room and announced their arrest for treason against the Empire and democracy. After locking up the members of the OHF, a group of banned opposition politicians moved into the council chamber. Among them were Kazim Karabekir, the leader of the former Democratic Party, Sabahattin Efendi, the progressive prince, and finally Mustafa Sabri, the Shaykh al-Islam.\n\nThis opposition group accused the OHF of having sought to destroy the Empire and to transform it into an anti-Islamist, pro-union republic. The OHF has further been accused of neglecting the army and external threats, which it was supposed to protect from. With most major OHF politicians being put behind bars, the next step of the opposition members was to create a new party, the Ottoman Salvation Party or OSP. Thereafter they declared the state of emergency, for they knew that half the nation was still under OHF control and would have to be taken back from the hands of these traitors.\n\nHowever, before getting started on fighting the remaining influence of the OHF, the members of the OSP first had to decide on the fate of the Sultan. After some discussion, it was decided that he should be forced to abdicate because of his ties to the former government and his unwillingness to take action against those who betrayed the Empire and its people. With both the city and his palace being under complete control of soldiers loyal to the OSP, Ahmed IV had no choice but to accept this fate. For now, it was decided that our Empire should be ruled by a provisional government with Refet Pasha serving as the head of state. However, he cannot truly take the place of a Sultan, and thus a replacement for Ahmed will soon have to be found."
 tur_osp.1.a: "Will they be able to save the Empire?"
 tur_osp.2.t: "The OHF Fights Back"
 tur_osp.2.d: "The members of the OHF who managed to flee the capital, including many generals, sought refuge in other cities and went into hiding to organise the party's resistance. They called on the troops to rebel and the people to restore Ahmed IV as the legitimate Caliph. However, this appeal to the people went relatively unheeded, for they still feel betrayed by the OHF and believe that Ahmed failed to prevent such crisis. Nevertheless, many localities and institutions, mainly in the large cities, announced their support for the democratically elected party and rejected what many call the Evening Coup.\n\nAfter the initial euphoria following the success of the coup, the new government realised that its task was not going to be easy. The OHF has left its mark on the institutions and has already established many reforms that seem difficult to reverse. It will certainly be quite the endeavour to go back on very progressive and liberal reforms and fight the OHF presence in local administrations at the same time. Furthermore, many are still questioning the righteousness of the OSP rule, seeing as [TUR.GetLeader]'s reign has not yet been approved by an Ottoman Sultan, another issue which will have to be addressed in the future if the Empire is to withstand the sands of time."
 tur_osp.2.a: "The wolf shows its teeth."
 tur_osp.3.t: "A Cabinet Alone"
 tur_osp.3.d: "As if the resistance of the OHF was not enough, the coalition has now found itself in complete political solitude. Most of the democratic figures have gone into hiding for fear of the OHF and do not dare to resurface, the people are far too preoccupied with the national crisis to be interested in politics, and the few members of the different parties of the governing coalition cannot agree on how to proceed.\n\nAlthough the OSP government currently has next to no support among the populace, our leaders are confident of the way forward. By eliminating the OHF, they plan to avoid any subversive influence, and by reversing their reforms they want to curry favour with the parties that opposed them. Finally, by solving the economic crisis, the party and the coalition can secure the trust of the people, and thus stabilise the position of the provisional government."
 tur_osp.3.a: "A successful coup 'in facts'."
 tur_osp.4.t: "Unrest in the Ranks"
 tur_osp.4.d: "Most of the generals who were calling for a revolt against the government were spotted and arrested by our agents, and are now languishing in prison awaiting trial. However, the arrest of Fahrettin Pasha, and the key group of OHF supporters in the army, is causing the armed forces to rumble. For big trouble, Fevzi Pasha managed to elude us and his current location is unknown. Many soldiers have deserted and the army is now involved in political scandals. If we do not intervene quickly, the situation could very well degenerate and endanger not only the position of the OSP and [TUR.GetLeader], but also the entire nation."
 tur_osp.4.a: "If you're not with me, then you are my enemy!"
 tur_osp.5.t: "Refet Pasha Succeeds in Rallying the Democrats"
 tur_osp.5.d: "The pre-OHF parties have once again been allowed to meet freely and express their opinions in their respective newspapers, the Millet System has been reestablished, and the most radical changes introduced by the OHF, most notably the separation of Church and State, have been reverted. All of this happened with the blessing of the Shaykh al-Islam, which is why most of the influential minorities of the Empire and also the conservatives now support the new government.\n\nNobody can dispute that the OSP coalition is a real political success. Numerous parties have decided to become a part of the coalition, and Refet Pasha is generally considered to be the saviour of democracy and religious justice in our nation. Although our people still wish for the return of a Sultan and are thus not entirely content with the current situation, the future seems to once again shine bright for an Empire that until recently was on the brink of collapse."
 tur_osp.5.a: "A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one!"
 tur_osp.6.t: "오스만 민주주의의 복원"
 tur_osp.6.d: "Thanks to the measures taken by the coalition, Ottoman democracy has been restored. The elimination of the military resistance of the OHF and the opposition brought a wind of freedom to all those exiled and oppressed by the authoritarian government. Furthermore, the implementation of reforms by Mustafa Sabri allowed the government to win the hearts of many politicians and the conservative milieu alike. Finally, the policy of economic revival and recovery promulgated by Fatin Rüstü Bey made the people regain their faith in the government and rekindled a feeling of Turkish national pride.\nNow, the Meclis-i Mebûsan has been restored and the deputies were called upon to return to their seats and prepare for the election that will define the future of the coalition."
 tur_osp.6.a: "최고의 당이 승리하겠지!"
 tur_osp.7.t: "구국 선거"
 tur_osp.7.d: "It is time for the elections of the assembly chaired by the OSP coalition. Despite the multitude of political currents and parties, the coalition only consists of two wings, the liberals and the conservatives.\n\nThe progressive liberals are a kind of mix between the DF (Democratic Party), the HIF (Liberal Entente) and some nationalist and progressive movements not far from the OHF and the CUP but disgusted by their authoritarian ways. They are mainly led by Kazim Karabekir, who was granted leadership of the party in exchange for allowing Prince Sabahattin the free implementation of his progressive reforms, that were inspired by his stay in France, with the help of a committee.\n\nTheir opponent is the conservative wing of the OSP. The conservatives are mainly democrats who no longer want anti-religious reforms and instead aim to strengthen the relations of the government with the Sultan Caliph. They rejected the practices of Shakib Arslan's Mohammedan Union and found themselves led by the Shaykh al-Islam himself, Sabri Efendi. Efendi is a Muslim scholar, who believes that Islam is still the religion of science, just like it has been in earlier centuries, during which Eastern scholars made up the forefront of technological advances. He is also the leader of the Teali-i Islam Cemiyeti (Society for the Elevation of Islam).\n\nSince both wings of the party seem to be pretty popular among the people, one could only speculate who would be able to win the election. However, as the day came to an end, a clear victor emerged."

 tur_osp.7.c: "보수파가 승리를 간신히 확보했다!"
 tur_osp.9.t: "여성 참정권?"
 tur_osp.9.d: "Women's rights largely refer to their civil rights, to divorce, to inherit or to work freely, but also certain political rights like the right to vote. Sabahattin and Karabekir are both progressive men of the Empire and wish to extend the political rights of the women of our nation. However, the coalition does not entirely agree with this idea, because it was seen as a bit too modernist. Some conservatives even accused Sabahattin and Karabekir of being in league with the OHF. Should they seek to push the Equality Act at the cost of valuable allies, or should they simply ask for some civil concessions and abandon the idea of voting rights?"
 tur_osp.9.a: "사회적 진보는 국가의 우선 사항이다!"
 tur_osp.9.b: "양보해야 한다."
 tur_osp.10.t: "People Politicisation Campaign"
 tur_osp.10.d: "Democracy is one thing, practice is another. In the Empire, a large part of the population is illiterate and an even larger part not interested in politics. However, in order for a democracy to be functional and not turn into an oligarchy, the entire population must vote. If the abstention rate is too high, a minority controls the vote and with it the power. This is why Kazim Karabekir launched his campaign to politicise the people, among other things to make them interested and participate in politics. Through objective awareness campaigns and village visits, the Pasha intends to instil democracy in the people."
 tur_osp.10.a: "We must safeguard democracy!"
 tur_osp.11.t: "Le Code Civile Ottoman"
 tur_osp.11.d: "The Mecelle Code, or 'Code Civil Ottoman' in its French appellation, is the civil code of the Empire. Kemal tried to reform it unsuccessfully and the people thought the debate was settled, but now, after the coup, the question of the Mecelle was raised once again. The liberals planned to copy the Swiss civil code because of its modernity. However, maybe it would be better to modify it a bit. We should keep some of the immutable rules of the Shariah, but also establish a commission, which could create a real Ottoman Code, independent of any inspirations."
 tur_osp.11.a: "We have brought peace, freedom, justice and security to our new Empire."
 tur_osp.12.t: "The Zakat Charity"
 tur_osp.12.d: "The Zakat, or Muslim charity, is a precept often forgotten by our colleagues around the world. Sultan Ömer, a good man, took it upon himself to remind us of this and to create a tax on wealth. The latter will be redistributed to the poorest believers and will be used to finance social aid projects of the state. 'The tax will be distributed to the poor, the needy, those who work in the service of zakat, the new converts whose hearts need to be strengthened, the slaves, the indebted, the volunteer fighters and the travellers,' according to a sura in the Koran."
 tur_osp.12.a: "Allah is protecting us, brothers."
 tur_osp.13.t: "Reinstatement of the National Protection Act"
 tur_osp.13.d: "We have sought to impose the liberal economy on ourselves in a hurry. However, it appears that the Ottoman economy is not yet ready to abandon all its pre-war protectionist measures. At the risk of being crushed by competition, the government was more or less forced to reestablish quotas and standards, and to once again prioritise the military industry."
 tur_osp.13.a: "The people have their own speed..."
 tur_osp.14.t: "Emile Durkheim and Modern Sociology"
 tur_osp.14.d: "Emile Durkheim is the founder of sociology, the scientific study of society and human social behaviour. This science is very important, especially in politics, as it allows a better understanding of the relationships between individuals in society. This is why sociology is said to extend to all human sciences. Politically, Durkheim was not a Marxist but a friend of Jean Jaurès and had a leaning towards reformist socialism.\n\nSabahattin discovered and adopted sociology during his exile in France. When he was later exiled to Switzerland, he had time to develop this passion and his democratic ideas at the same time. His project of decentralisation of the Empire came from political sociological theses.\n\nSabahattin wants to create a university of sociology, the first in the Empire, as sociology was previously linked to philosophy. This university would train new Turkish scientists and allow for the modern development of Ottoman thought."
 tur_osp.8.a: "Interesting."
 tur_osp.19.t: "Reform of the Code de Commerce Ottoman"
 tur_osp.19.d: "The Kanunname-i Ticaret or 'Code de Commerce Ottoman' in French is the commercial code of the Ottoman Empire, based on the French code of 1809. It is the highest instance of commercial law within the Empire. However, with the development of liberalism, this code, which has not been modified since its creation in 1809, seems outdated and appears to do more harm than good. A committee of jurists, together with business leaders, was set up to amend the code, in order to bring it up to modern standards."
 tur_osp.19.a: "We have to adjust to the global market."
 tur_osp.20.t: "Pro-OHF Garrisons are Rebelling"
 tur_osp.20.d: "Outraged by the OSP takeover and the anti-OHF policies the coalition seems to be pursuing, several battalions, led by OHF officers, rebelled in the vicinity of Smyrna and Afyon. [TUR.GetLeader] hurriedly took his horse and sent numerous telegrams to try to stop the insurgents. After they did not heed his calls to lay down their weapons, the Pasha gathered soldiers still loyal to the government and began to advance against the rebels. According to the latest news, it was more of a skirmish and sporadic clashes than a real revolt and was put down rather quickly. Still, many of our soldiers were wounded or even killed. This may not happen again! This resistance must be eliminated as quickly as possible!"
 tur_osp.20.a: "We have to protect the OSP!"
 tur_osp.21.t: "Opening of the Durkheim Institute"
 tur_osp.21.d: "Sabahattin's university project has come to fruition and has even gone beyond. In a government initiative, sociologists from all over Europe came to admire the opening congress of the Durkheim Institute, which has been named in honour of the sociologist who inspired the sociological and political thinking of Prince Sabahattin. The Sultan himself also came to greet the professors and scientists present. During the congress, a tribute was paid to the Prince by Emmanuel Levinas, a French-Lithuanian philosopher. A few days after the opening ceremony, the university began to recruit its first students. Soon, this university shall become a centre of sociological thought throughout Europe."
 tur_osp.21.a: "Splendid!"
 tur_osp.22.t: "The Great Debate"
 tur_osp.22.d: "Today, Sultan Ömer announced on his own initiative the creation of a great debate. News of this event was relayed to the entire population by the radio stations and the newspapers of the Empire and surprised the common folk and administrators alike. The debate has been designed as follows: For four months, citizens shall have the chance to meet in small assemblies and discuss what they think are the most necessary investments the government should undertake and changes needed to be made. These local assemblies will be responsible for receiving the wishes of all citizens. Afterwards, an organisation will group these wishes by theme and present them to the assembly, which will then discuss how actionable these wishes are and if they can become a part of reality. Furthermore, Sultan Ömer insisted on doing the same in the national public schools, in order to enhance the education system and give young students a better outlook on life."
 tur_osp.22.a: "This is democracy!"
 tur_osp.23.t: "Foreign Sheikhs Recognise the Ottoman Caliphate"
 tur_osp.23.d: "Following our defeat in the Desert War, many Muslim officials were concerned about the Padishah's standing in Muslim opinion around the world. Some feared that his popularity and, even worse, his legitimacy would be undermined. However, an event occurred that contradicted these concerns. Sheikhs from all over the world, from French Africa, the conquering Middle East, India and even Asia came to affirm the place the Ottoman Caliphate holds in the Islamic world as the 'Shadow of God on Earth'. This further strengthened confidence in the institutions and religion of the Empire, strengthened the national pride of the people and gave a great boost to the prestige of our nation."
 tur_osp.23.a: "We haven't said our last words!"
 tur_osp.24.t: "Muslims Around the World Donate to the Caliph"
 tur_osp.24.d: "Following the national call for Zakat, a tax which aims at redistributing the wealth of the people, many foreign newspapers, mainly conservative ones, took it upon themselves to publicise this act of generosity conducted by the new Caliph of Islam. These publications were followed by an incredible wave of charity from believers from all around the world. Not only their own countries, but also many of the faithful donated for the reconstruction of the Empire and the improvement of the living standards for the poorest of our country."

Its turnover has increased and, despite the war, the aristocrats and entrepreneurs all over the world are snatching up our products. Several subsidiary shops have already opened in Berlin, Vienna, Algiers and New York. Even though Turkish coffee could be considered a luxury product, it has become terribly popular because of the fact that the beans are left in the coffee, which enhances the taste tremendously.

Karabekir, whom some call 'the friend of children' or 'papa pasha', also has a personal relationship with many of his children and cares for them like a real father would.

 tur_osp.27.d: "Prince Ömer Faruk Efendi has alway been admired by the people for the bravery he demonstrated during the Weltkrieg and the Desert War. Furthermore, he has been a close friend and associate of Refet Bele Pasha for quite some time now, and it is no secret that his political views mostly align with those of the OSP. For most of the country, it seemed almost certain that if someone was to be proclaimed Sultan by the provisional government, he would be the one chosen. Still, Refet first wanted to stabilise the nation, and felt that he needed full control of the executive powers usually reserved for our Sultans in order to reach this goal.\n\nNow, however, with life in the country slowly returning to normal and the influence of the OHF at an all-time low, it was decided that the time for a Sultan to return to the throne of the Empire had come. As anticipated, the government approached Ömer, who didn't hesitate to accept their offer. His coronation ceremony was held in Dolmabahçe Palace not too long thereafter. As per Ottoman tradition, the ceremony started with Ömer saying a prayer in front of the holy relics of the Empire, followed by him taking his place on the throne and some of the most important OSP politicians congratulating him and kissing his robes. After the Shaykh-al-Islam said a final prayer, Ömer and the leaders of the provisional government rode to the Eyüp Sultan Mosque, where, after another short prayer, Ömer underwent the sword ceremony, during which he symbolically buckled on the sword of Osman I. With the end of the ceremony, Ömer had officially become Ömer I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and Caliph of Islam. Throughout the country, our people are celebrating, for their nation is now no longer without a proper leader."

 tur.2.t: "국민주의자의 반정부 시위"
 tur.2.d: "Mustafa Kemal, out of his political slumber, took advantage of the revolt to publish several articles claiming that the defeat was the work of the democratic coalition and that the Sultan had betrayed the country by removing him from his post of Grand Vizier a few years ago. He also accused the government of having capitulated to quickly and requested the immediate reconquest of the former Turkish territories.\n\nIn his most recent publication, he called on the revolutionaries and those who want to save the Empire to join the nationalist resistance. This nationalist resistance is growing stronger by the day and has now begun to organise large protests in order to force the government to accept what they call \"the will of the people\"."
 tur.2.a: "They failed the Turkish people by bringing them into war!"
 tur.3.t: "Officers and Soldiers Leave the Ranks"
 tur.3.d: "Over the course of the week, numerous alarming reports reached the ears of the government of the Sublime Porte. In the underworld of [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], several secret associations were discovered. These organisations mostly conduct illegal arms trade and supply a number of citizens with weapons that, theoretically, only the military should have access to. In addition, there were a large number of deserters, which shocked the high command, since it was believed that the end of the war had satisfied the men. As if this alone was not scary enough, seeing how our army was already disorganised and underequipped before these men deserted, there were also some officers that, after officially resigning from the army, took the train to eastern Anatolia. Could it be to join the nationalist resistance movement?"
 tur.3.a: "Where are they going?"
 tur.4.t: "The Morning Coup"
 tur.4.d: "This morning at around 5:30 a.m., gunfire could be heard from the Yildiz Palace where Ahmed IV resided. At the same time, men stormed the War Ministry and the Sublime Porte and seized control of most major political and military institutions. Aided from within by the city's guards and garrison, a train brought the nationalist leaders to the outskirts of the capital. Mustafa Kemal, his private guard and General Ismet took control of the government, while Fevzi took over the war ministry. Since most of the garrison stationed in the city sided with the nationalists, the few men still loyal to the HIF were unable to form a major resistance. Within an hour, the coup concluded and the power once again fell into the hands of Kemal.\n\nThe news spread throughout the city at lightning speed. Whole processions formed in joy to cheer the saviours of the Empire, and even the Sultan himself officially recognised the new government towards the end of the day. This was a little too late for the Gazi's liking. At noon, he issued a statement as Grand Vizier of the capital of the 'Turkish Empire', as our nation was referred to in the document, announcing the beginning of the reign of his newly formed government and calling for the rescue of the nation from the imperialists and Arab bandits who were endangering it. He promised to undertake the necessary measures to protect the Turkish people and that progress would save them from the horrors they had experienced. Even though the now deposed government still controls some areas of Anatolia, many people have by now already accepted the Grand Vizier's reign, hoping that he will bring peace, freedom, justice and security to his new Empire."
 tur.4.a: "Yaşa, Mustafa Kemal Paşa, yaşa!"
 tur.5.t: "Back to Reality"
 tur.5.d: "After the success of the coup, the government of Kemal took stock of the situation, and realised one thing: The situation looks desperate. Before the new government could implement the promised reforms, it would first have to deal with the internal struggles that plague the nation.\n\nThe first difficulty is obviously the impact the HIF had on the country. Democratic and decentralist reforms will be difficult, but not entirely impossible to reverse. If this goal is to be achieved, it will be necessary to make the people and the administrations understand that the Kemalist reforms are the only things able to save the Empire in these dark times.\n\nHowever, this is not the only task ahead of Kemal and his supporters. They will also have to deal with the economic crisis affecting the country. Indeed, the loss of half of the Empire's land has inevitably had an impact on the general standard of living as well as on the country's productive capacity.\n\nIf Kemal manages to deal with these internal problems, he will surely have regained the trust of the people. Even though the situation may look dire, the Pasha is full of hope and confident in his abilities to lead the people into a brighter future."
 tur.5.a: "Will they be able to handle the situation?"
 tur.6.t: "Traditionalist Resistance"
 tur.6.d: "With the rise of the nationalist party to power, many conservatives saw a return to the Kemalist reforms planned before the election defeat of the OHF. The Shaykh al-Islam himself called on the government to show religious tolerance and respect for traditions, fearing that the Kemalists might trample on these values. Many muftis, hodjas and imams have already organised rallies to protest against the fall of the liberal coalition and the rise of the \"illegitimate nationalist regime\". In the eastern parts of Anatolia, the traditionalist resistance has already become violent, as several gendarmes have been assassinated by Kurdish zealots.\n\n§RThe mechanics of traditionalism are now in place. At the beginning of the Kemalist reforms you can access the percentage of traditionalist resistance. This resistance will be able to define future political events and developments..."

 tur.7.t: "무스타파 케말 파샤의 사망"
 tur.7.d: "Despite the Gazi's political withdrawal, death decided to come knocking at his door. Very early this morning, his friend Ali Fethi, who was to visit him for their usual walk, went to the Pasha's flats. His aide-de-camp, who was awakened to fetch him, found him lying in his bed, dead. After hearing this terrible news, Fethi's first words were: 'Kemal, my friend, what will we do without you?', for the Gazi had recently refused to be called Mustafa. Another friend of his, Salih, shot himself in the chest after being informed of the death of the Pasha.\n\nThe OHF Party in Constantinople was quick to respond by declaring an official national day of mourning. The party also issued a joint statement, in which it thanked the Pasha, referred to as \"Halâskâr Gazi\", the Saviour Gazi (Holy Warrior), for his actions during the war. Furthermore, various vessels, both small and large, military and civilian, sailed in front of Kemal's seashore villa, shouting, crying and waving the Ottoman flag in memory of the man now forever captivated in the legacy of our Grand Empire."
 tur.7.a: "The nation mourns the death of Kemal Pasha."
 tur.8.t: "Power Struggle for Kemal's Succession"
 tur.8.d: "The rumour spread quickly that Kemal Pasha had left a will for one of his collaborators. Although many party members claim that Kemal personally chose Ismet Pasha as his successor, some also argued that Kemal was a progressive man, and that his last wish was to restore democracy upon his death in order to stabilise the country. Celal Bayar and Rauf Pasha are among those who demand the organisation of internal elections in the party. Ismet remained strangely silent during the extraordinary session, only defended by Kemal's closest friends.\n\nIt appears that this endless debate over Kemal's will has now divided the party, which was the only source of stability after the Gazi's death. This instability and infighting led to some people believing that there could be an opportunity for the opposition to strike once again..."
 tur.8.a: "This is not good..."
 tur.9.t: "Coup Attempt by General Fahrettin Pasha"
 tur.9.d: "In the afternoon, the party leadership received disturbing news: The Imperial Palace had been taken over and the Osman family taken hostage in the wake of a political coup attempt. The plotters also swiftly took control of the Ministry of War, making prisoners of some of the OHF politicians present there. The person responsible is said to be General Fahrettin Fakhri Pasha, the defender of Medina. The old general is known for his attachment to Islam, religious values and traditions, and is said to be under surveillance by Kemalist agents for his discontent with the new government. In any case, with the capture of the symbolic power entity and the high command, all that is left for him to do is to take the party headquarters in order to capture the government for his coup to be successful. However, a large part of the garrison remained loyal to the OHF, and the Sultan has not yet recognised the general's government.\n\nIsmet Pasha seems to have been presented a window of opportunity - and he is determined to end the illegitimate rule of the general prematurely. Surely, most soldiers and government officials present in the capital would support him if he were to stage a counter-coup against Fahrettin Pasha. He has to act quickly however - or the general will have taken control of the party headquarters before the day comes to an end."
 tur.9.a: "The Defender of Medina makes it!"
 tur.9.b: "Ismet Pasha and the OHF leaders stage a counter-coup!"
 tur.10.t: "Fahrettin Pasha Restores Order"
 tur.10.d: "As the day was coming to a close, Ismet Resit called on the OHF deputies to surrender. Seeing the internal dissension of the party after the death of Gazi and the hopelessness of their situation made the OHF politicians question what they were fighting for, which led to them giving in to the demands. Fahrettin Pasha recognised this act of bravery and promised a fair trial to all Kemalist officials. After securing power, he returned to the Imperial Palace, where the Sultan was already waiting for him. Before the Sultan could congratulate the general, Fahrettin is said to have forced him to abdicate surrounded by the members of the new government, a coalition calling itself the Ottoman Salvation Party. The leadership of this new party is composed of the progressive minds Sabahattin Efendi and Kazim Karabekir, and the enigmatic Mustafa Sabri, the Shaykh al-Islam. The Defender of Medina became the leader of the government and promised to proclaim a new Sultan and hold free elections as soon as calm and peace prevailed in the country."
 tur.10.a: "Thank you for your services, Pasha!"
 tur.11.t: "Ismet Reveals Kemal's Will to the Public"
 tur.11.d: "After regaining power, and gaining the full confidence of the Kemalist party, Ismet took to the podium. Known for his infrequent speeches and his deafness that allows him to ignore the arguments of his opponents, the Pasha is also known for his military and political career in the shadow of the Gazi. Determined and dressed in a frock coat, Ismet announced that he was the possessor of Kemal's will. He hastened to read out the part reserved for this purpose and announced that the rest was to be known only to the government.\n\nIn his will, Kemal named Ismet as his humble successor. He also expressed his sadness at the idea of dying without having been able to complete his ideas, ideas that he had kept for many years in his diary until the day when 'Turkey' would finally be ready. He wrote about his progressives ambitions, the importance of the Turkish identity and above all the creation of a real national sovereignty. He also asked the people to trust his successor and friend for the continuation of his thought."
 tur.11.a: "We will honour the ambitions and wishes of the Gazi!"
 tur.12.t: "Mysticism in Anatolia"
 tur.12.d: "Sufi orders have long played an important role within the Ottoman Empire, and many of our past Sultans were part of these orders. Initially serving semi-independent from the state apparatus, these orders were brought closer to the central authority of the state during the top-down reforms of the CUP at the start of the 20th century. Reforms included centralisation and bureaucratisation of the brotherhoods, the creation of training courses for Sufi sheikhs, the institution of detailed dress policies, and inspections of the practices of various orders. Slowly but surely, the orders became a part of the Ottoman state itself.\n\nWith their closer attachment to the state, however, came a closer connection to the political scene in Kostantiniyye, and although only a minority of the population is part of one of these orders, their deep connection to the men of power has led to unbridled corruption and political influence. Some even go so far as to say that the electoral victory and bestowment of the Grand Vizier title on the leader of the HIF was directly caused by these orders in an attempt to halt the Kemalist reforms.\n\nThe different orders range from the Mevlevi tarikat or \"Whirling Dervishes\" to the more powerful Kadiri tarikat, whose close support of the Sultans has in the past led to them becoming the kingmaker in the capital. As the Grand Vizier has shown his desire to greatly limit the power of these organisations, many of them are attempting to sway uncertain party members to block his proposal. The Sultan himself has also in private conversation with the Grand Vizier and multiple Sheiks from the orders showed his discontent with the direction of the policies his Vizier pursues."
 tur.12.a: "Cut their fundings from the State!"
 tur.12.b: "They shall remain intact."
 tur.13.t: "The Sultan and the Orders Protest"
 tur.13.d: "Thus far deferring from personally intervening, the Caliph has finally seen himself forced to intervene against his own Grand Vizier. As the radical secularisation is done with almost brute force, he isn't the only one opposing the reforms which are fundamentally changing the Ottoman state and, at least according to the conservatives, inflicting massive damage on the pillars of its society, bordering on heresy and treason to the Caliph.\n\nThe Sultan-Caliph, who not only leads the Ottoman Empire but all of Islam itself, has therefore called for a meeting with the Shaykh al-Islam and his cabinet to revert their decision to close the Sufi lodges and to reinstate their influence. Outside of the palace walls, protests are rocking the nation, as conservative hotbeds such as Bursa, Konya and Lazistan angrily react to the reforms."
 tur.13.a: "You don't have any power here!"
 tur.14.t: "술탄국의 운명"
 tur.14.d: "One of Gazi Mustafa Kemal's deepest wishes was the creation of a Turkish republic, separate from the minorities who wanted the nation dead. The republic the Gazi dreamed of was to be based on nationalism and democracy. Many party members considered the reform feasible. Indeed, since the 1909 coup d'état by the CUP, the Sultan has merely been a puppet of the governing parties. He does not truly lead the nation anymore, even though Abdülmecid II has been more influential than his predecessors.\n\nIf the reform came into effect, the title of Padishah would be split between the Caliph and the Sultan, with the Sultan retaining his religious but not political authority. Sultan [TUR.GetLeader] could not oppose the measure due to the weakness of his authority.\n\nThe abolition of the Sultanate would be a turning point in world history. It would put a definitive end to the existence of the Ottoman Empire. It would nevertheless also allow for a better implementation of the secularisation planned by Kemal and could overall be considered a great leap forward."

 tur.14.b: "술탄은 우리의 지도자시다! 대체될 수 없다!"
 tur.15.t: "동방의 빛"
 tur.15.d: "The measure was finally taken. As the Sultan's aide-de-camp warned him of the vote that took place in the Meclis i-Mebûsan, the institution had already been reorganised into the Turkish National Assembly. The latter directly undertook the transformation of the post of Grand Vizier into that of Prime Minister, and later created an entirely new title - President. The election for the first President of the Republic was held within the Party. However, for most people, the result was already clear before the votes were even counted: Ismet Reşit won with an overwhelming majority of votes and was thus elected to lead our nation into its future. He proclaimed this in a patriotic speech to the nation, in which he said: \"I am following the will of Kemal. Word for word I shall make his dreams become reality. I shall save the Turkish people and rekindle their pride by pulling them out of obscurantism and religious superstition.\"\n\nWhile many see the beginning of a truly modern and great Turkish state in the newly founded republic, the Traditionalists remain sceptical. They fear the ambitions of their new President and can only imagine how far he is ready to go in the name of his dead Gazi."
 tur.15.a: "튀르키예 공화국 만세!"
 tur.16.t: "Standardisation of the Turkish Flag"
 tur.16.d: "The Ottoman flag has changed many times throughout history. For a long time our flag consisted of a yellow crescent on a red background (the symbol of the Turkish people), then three yellow crescents on a green background (the colour of Islam), and finally, more recently, a crescent and a star representing Islam and Turkey alike. However, there are some that still use the Tügra of the Sultan as an emblem. Therefore, Ismet initiated the standardisation of the Turkish flag. A committee specified the exact colour of the red, the size and geometry of the crescent and its proportions. From now on, our new and clearly defined flag shall show the world the pride and unity of the Turkish people!"
 tur.16.a: "The crescent is flying upon the heads of the Turkish people!"
 tur.17.t: "Question of Religious Hats"
 tur.17.d: "The fez is a hat invented by the Greeks during antiquity. After it was adopted by the Ottomans to show the unity of the Empire's population, it became a hat with Muslim significance. However, why continue to wear a hat of foreign origin in a nation composed of Turks? Haven't the Greeks been our enemies on many occasions? Moreover, why should our people live in the past and not in the present? By forcing them to wear these idiotic customs we are preventing them from moving closer to Europe, where people are wearing modern and good-looking hats. Moreover, the turban is a legacy of a period when Muslims lived in the desert, so why force them into such practices? Our new state should be ruled by positivism, not superstition!"
 tur.17.a: "The Turkish people are too attached to their traditions."
 tur.17.b: "Ban the fez and turbans!"
 tur.18.t: "Question of Women's Headscarves"
 tur.18.d: "The beautiful Turkish women that one can meet in the streets are often veiled, which shows that even after all the modernisations we've already established in our country, religion is still deeply engrained in the day-to-day life of the people. There are several variants of this veil: First there is the Hijab, a simple veil on the head not covering the face or the body. Then there is the Niqāb, which covers the entire face except for the eyes. Last but not least there is the Burqa, a veil which is supposed to leave no visible flesh, even covering the eyes with the help of a transparent veil. Is it not problematic that Turkish women are forced to wear these insignia while men can wear whatever they want? Should women not be equal? Even though the veil is a heritage of the desert tribes who covered themselves to protect themselves from the sun and serves no real purpose nowadays, abolishing this constraint for women could lead to some major problems with the Traditionalists, who see these veils as an important part of Islamic and Turkish culture."
 tur.18.a: "This is way too far-reaching."
 tur.18.b: "Emancipation for our comrades, women!"
 tur.19.t: "Popular Sovereignty and Abolition of Millet System"
 tur.19.d: "The Millet system consists of giving a certain degree of autonomy to the different minorities of the Empire in the application of their religious laws, the collection of their taxes or their own local hierarchical system. In the Muslim religion, for example, the Ulema is headed by the Shaykh al-Islam, who dictates religious laws on the basis of the Shariah. This very unequal system for many people, especially in terms of criminal and commercial rights, has existed since the Tanzimat period. However, the system is beginning to show its age and does not fit into the modern and advanced state Turkey shall become. Seeing how the idea of Popular Sovereignty, or the equality of all Turkish citizens regardless of their religious affiliation before the law, has become increasingly popular, our government decided that it was about time to abolish the Millet system and enshrine the principle of equality before the law in the constitution."
 tur.19.a: "Another step towards progress."
 tur.20.t: "Unification and Co-education Finally Pushed"
 tur.20.d: "The project of Unification of Education, which can be translated into the privatisation of all religious learning institutions and the opening of national and secular public schools, was one of Kemal's most ambitious reforms. It also encompassed entrusting the state with the training of religious officials in order to avoid the creation of too radical a current and the spread of dangerous thoughts. The most radical part of this reform however is the decree on Co-Education. This decree gives Turkish girls equal rights to boys concerning their education, and allows them to visit the schools and learn the curricula that were formerly only accessible to men. Even though the Traditionalists are everything but happy with these reforms, arguing that they are an insult to the Turkish and Islamic culture, [TUR.GetLeader] decided to honour the will of the Gazi and to pave the way for a brighter future for the Turkish people."
 tur.20.a: "The teachers are the beacons of our new republic!"
 tur.21.t: "오스만 민법"
 tur.21.d: "The Ottoman Civil Code or Mecca Code is a relic of the Tanzimat period in the modern era and was supposed to balance the Shariah with the laws of the modern world, but it soon became outdated in the CUP period. Kemal's plan was to replace it with a most modern Turkish Civil Code, which was to be inspired by the Civil Codes of other progressive European nations. The Comittee in charge of rewriting the code chose the Swiss one as the model for the new Turkish law. The most significant changes this conversion would bring our nation are modern rights for women on inheritance, marriage and divorce as well as parental rights. With the creation of the new Turkish Civil Code also came the creation of a new and more progressive Commercial Code. While they were both developed when Kemal was still alive, he sadly died without ever seeing them implemented, mostly because the Traditionalist forces tried to stop their implementation by all means. However, with the Traditionalists losing more and more influence to the progressive government of [TUR.GetLeader], the wish of the Gazi can finally be fulfilled and the dream of a new and modern Civil Code realised."
 tur.21.a: "May this new Civil Code bring true equality to Turkey!"
 tur.22.t: "Women's Rights"
 tur.22.d: "As Mustafa Kemal once said: 'If henceforward the women do not partake in the social life of the nation, we shall never attain our full development. We shall remain irremediably backward, incapable of treating on equal terms with the civilisations of the West.' Seeing how Turkish women already obtained greater rights than women from most other European countries with the reform of the penal code, the wish of the Gazi now seems more actionable than ever before. If we grant our women the political right to vote and to be elected, Turkey will be one of the most advanced European countries. By granting women the right to work in certain professions that are currently exclusively practised by men, we would give them a chance to show their talents, which would benefit our nation both socially and economically.\n\nHowever, once again the Traditionalists are urging us to limit the advancement of women's rights, to do it more gradually. As always, they stressed the value of our culture and our traditions, and argue that these advancements aren't compatible with Islam itself. Nevertheless, if we were to give in to their backwards demands, we would flout Kemal's will - and the Gazi would be turning in his grave."
 tur.22.a: "Give them full rights!"
 tur.22.b: "They shall get them, just not today..."
 tur.23.t: "The Surname Law"
 tur.23.d: "The law of nicknames belongs to the most important laws of our country because it affects the very identity of every Turkish person. As per Ottoman tradition, newborn children are only given names that originate from the Koran. Often times they are subsequently also given nicknames based on their physical or behavioural attributes. For example, Kemal is a name given to very talented and overall perfect men. However, many people are also given their father's name after their own in order to make their kinship easily identifiable. While this system has been in place for many years now, it's about time we ask ourselves: Can a modern nation progress when individuals are drowned in a mass without individualisation? Should we really force our people to choose religious names for their children? Obviously, the answer to both of these questions is no. We shall make sure that every citizen will have a chance to choose their own name of Turkish origin!"
 tur.23.a: "Let me choose my own name!"
 tur.24.t: "Question of the Ottoman Titles"
 tur.24.d: "The most important Ottoman titles are probably Bey, meaning Sir, Efendi, expressing the wisdom of an individual, and Pasha, which is an honorary title given to governors, generals and others. These titles, which have almost become names, are vestiges of a bygone feudal era. Are we still a middle-aged monarchy? No! The Turkish nation is modern and must free itself from all traces of backwardness!\n\nHowever, these titles are very important in society and are highly integrated among both military and civilian personnel. They denote the prestige of an individual. Stripping these titles away from the people that earned them will surely make them everything but happy and content with the government. Should we really risk alienating this prestigious class?"
 tur.24.a: "This is a risk we cannot take!"
 tur.24.b: "Do it!"
 tur.25.t: "Abolition of the Caliphate"
 tur.25.d: "The Caliphate, the issue that will shape the future of the whole world. The Ottoman Sultan Selim I became Caliph of Islam, successor to the Prophet, after subjugating the Mamluks in 1517. By now the heirs of the House of Osman have become the 'Shadow of God on Earth'. This title radiates throughout the Muslim world, giving the Ottoman Empire international legitimacy and respect from Muslims around the world. The Caliph has the power to rule the Muslim religion and its fatwas. Since the artefacts of Prophet Mohammed are stored in our capital [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], no other usurper can legitimately claim the title of Caliph.\n\nHowever, it seems that this title is no longer respected. Politicians no longer hesitate to challenge the Caliph, the jihad proclaimed during the Weltkrieg remained almost silent and the Arab Muslim countries decided to dismantle the seat of our once glorious and unmatched Caliphate. Kemal's secret project, the hardest to reveal, was to abolish the Caliphate completely and to remove all remaining references to the Ottoman Empire in the Turkish state he wanted to establish. This move would mark a major turning point in the future of our nation and the entire Muslim world. Still, the Caliph could remain a symbolic figurehead without political power, entirely separate from the state. However, seeing how this move would more or less entirely secularise our state, the Traditionalists will likely be greatly angered by it and try everything in their power to stop us from making the Gazi's dream come true."
 tur.25.a: "The Turkish people existed before Islam, they can exist without it!"
 tur.25.b: "The Caliphate is untouchable."
 tur.26.t: "Swap to the Latin Script"
 tur.26.d: "The Ottoman language is a mixture of Arabic and Persian. It is composed of hundreds of character variants and often seems very complicated to learn. This is why it contributes to the very low literacy rate the Empire suffered from since its foundation. Moreover, with modern technologies such as the press and the telegram, the weaknesses of our language became even more apparent, since these inventions can hardly be used when having to account for hundreds of different symbols. Kemal had promised in his diary that if he came to power he would do his best to reform and make the nation speak a new Turkish language within three months. Since the nineteenth century, many scientists and professors have been advocating the adoption of the Latin alphabet, an idea which Kemal also supported. Even though some Turkish words would have to be modified because of their complexity, adopting the Latin script will make it easier to learn to write and read Turkish texts and will make our language more attractive to foreigners."
 tur.26.a: "We can no longer read our gravestones of old..."
 tur.27.t: "The History of the Turkic People"
 tur.27.d: "The question of the history of the Turkic people is still open to debate. For many, the Huns and Attila are the ancestors of our glorious nation, with Timur and Kubilay Khan also being considered great rulers of Turkish descent. This widely accepted theory further demonstrates why the Turkish nation is so determined and combative. After so many wars and centuries of confrontation against nations sometimes much more powerful than us, we are still here. We are responsible for the fall of two Roman empires and all the Arab kingdoms. All of Europe once trembled when hearing our name. Let us spread the teaching of these theories widely and send historians to study our history more fervently than ever. The Turkish people shall be unified through their extraordinary history!"
 tur.27.a: "Üzgün Dururlar Bakma, Eli Kafaya Takma."
 tur.28.t: "Rebellion of an Anatolian Sheikh"
 tur.28.d: "A sheikh and a few muftis, who were unhappy with the current secularistic policy of the empire, launched an insurrection in a small town near Ankara, hoping to ignite a flame that would sooner or later become a raging fire and devour the progressive politicians responsible for the anti-religious policies of the state. These agitators managed to gather nearly a thousand people who supported their views and formed a procession. Waving the green colours of Islam, they proclaimed the restoration of the Shariah. After the mob killed two municipal officials and a young commander of the local garrison who tried to stop the procession from advancing further, the army dispersed the crowd and took the Sheikh and the most vocal protesters prisoners. After hearing of the event, Ismet was furious. He ordered the construction of a memorial in order to honour the soldier that gave his life trying to stop the insurrection and decided to punish the population of the town. While some of them were sentenced to spend the next years of their lives in prison, others were forced to pay huge fines or placed under house arrest."
 tur.28.a: "How dare they?!"
 tur.29.t: "국유화 문제"
 tur.29.d: "Many modern and populist ideologies embrace nationalisation as an economic solution. By forcibly nationalising or buying up most of the nation's vital factories, these states separate themselves from liberalism completely. Some extremes in the party already stated their support for the implementation of this radical solution in Turkey. Recep Peker has claimed to defend the motion and has more or less become the leader of the nationalist wing of the party. He even advocates an alliance with some Kadro ideologues, who by many are considered extremists.\n\nModerates like Ismet would prefer to stay with the original plan and nationalise only companies with too much foreign capital by buying them out. Should the extremist wing of the party manage to push through its demands, this could give a lot of confidence to Recep Peker, a protégé of Kemal, and the Kadro, a dark ideological group."
 tur.29.a: "We need nationalisation inspired by socialism!"
 tur.29.b: "Partial nationalisation is enough."
 tur.30.t: "The Kadroist Wing of the Party Takes over"
 tur.30.d: "By now, more than a third of the People's Party members have joined the nationalist wing, which has grown very attached to the ideas of the Kadroists, a group of individuals wanting to save Turkey from the liberal politicians. Seeing the party split in two under his leadership, Ismet decided to retreat from politics and resign from the post of president, thinking that he has failed his dear friend Kemal. Thereafter, the party voted on who should become Ismet's successor. A clear majority chose Kemal's young protégé, Recep Peker. The latter, the de facto leader of the nationalist wing, proclaimed the beginning of a new era for Turkey and promised to succeed where the Moderates failed.\n\nFollowing his rise to power, Peker concluded an official alliance with the Kadroists and integrated them into the nationalist wing of the party, which was then renamed into the 'Kadroist wing'. The Kadroists are interested in the extremist movements of countries close to totalism and communism, and argue that in order to save the country from its unstable political situation and the Weltkrieg, they'll have to draw inspiration from these extremes and use them in accordance with Kemalism. In practice, this means that they'll introduce great social reforms and combine them with a populist and nationalist economic policy. The Turkish revolution has begun!"
 tur.30.a: "We need to save Turkey!"
 tur.31.t: "영구혁명"
 tur.31.d: "Kadro Paper theorists such as Sevket Süreyya Aydemir and Falih Rifki toured Europe several times and notably participated in the Totalism Congress in France, where they were urged by the Syndicalists to help Kemal liberate Turkey from German-Muslim imperialism. Despite a desire to separate themselves from the Marxist ideology on the pretext that its flaws prevented it from functioning in Turkey, they never denied that they were greatly inspired by it. Moreover, the Kadroist poet Hamdullah Suphi praised Mussolini and Mosley, the leaders of two major totalist movements, in one of his poems. Coming closer to extreme nationalism coupled with populism, the Kadro system might finally agree to link up with Marxism in order to open up a new diplomatic opportunity for Turkey with the Internationale, an emerging alliance especially among developing countries. Turkey, with its intermediary position between Europe, Africa and Asia, would surely fit perfectly into this revolutionary alliance."
 tur.31.a: "Kemalist ideas must be preserved from Marxism!"
 tur.31.b: "Let's take the revolution to its conclusion!"
 tur.32.t: "Fevzi Çakmak Seizes Power"
 tur.32.d: "Following the passing of the law prohibiting any active military member of the People's Party from running for political office and their expulsion from parliament, many military officers were incensed and argued that this was unacceptable. Among them was one of Kemal's friends and chief of staff, Fevzi Çakmak. However, the government did not foresee the setback this would have on the stability of the country. With the creation of an independent army and the disorder this measure created, many Traditionalists organised simultaneous attacks and killed a few hundred people in order to underline their demands for political conservatism. This created popular indignation, with some calling the Mareşal for help. [TUR.GetLeader], not knowing what else to do, called his old friend Fevzi back, promising him emergency powers and the revocation of the law separating military and politics if he fought back against the Traditionalists.\n\nFevzi used his newfound powers to establish a military government and declared martial law in the most conservative provinces. With the military once again under government control, he managed to arrest several members of the organised Islamist groups responsible for the attacks. The Mareşal and his victories were acclaimed by large crowds in the streets of most major cities. Arguing that he is the only one that can save the Turkish people form their self-destruction, the Mareşal decided to keep his current powers and to take over the position of president. In a speech, he promised the people to step in the footsteps of Mustafa Kemal and to guide them into a glorious future."
 tur.32.a: "Hopefully, the Mareşal will manage to save the Turkish people."
 tur.33.t: "Modern Soldier Training"
 tur.33.d: "With the creation of a new army with new training methods, we can focus our soldiers and their training on specific combat styles. They have to be ready for the wars to come, no matter where the battlefields may lay and no matter who they will have to fight against.\n\nTurkey is at the crossroad of three continents, lying between Asia, Europe and Africa. Because of this, we are surrounded by all types of terrain and climatic environments, from the steppes, over the mountains of the Caucasus, to the deserts of Sinai and Iraq. Therefore, it would make sense to focus our training methods on adapting our soldiers to all the different environments they may have to fight in.\n\nHowever, modern battles also rely on speed and swiftness. Kemal was a fan of mobile warfare and preferred to use cavalry in his strategies. With the evolution of technology, we can continue his plans and even go a step further by replacing horses with tanks and motorised equipment."
 tur.33.a: "They have to be able to adapt to every situation!"
 tur.33.b: "We should focus on the modern cavalry, which was dear to Kemal."
 tur.34.t: "Status of the Army"
 tur.34.d: "The question of the status of the army is a rather delicate one. Due to the military attachment of the Turkish people, many nationalists and party members are also high-ranking military officials. For example, famous politicians like Ismet, Recep and Kemal were all part of the military at some point. Also, there are people like Fevzi and Fahrettin, who are still serving in the military despite their political commitment. However, as we noticed during the HIF period, the presence of the army can lead to coups against the government in place if the political situation is not to its liking, which was quite useful in bringing the OHF to power. Nevertheless, with the Kemalist reforms and the resistance they've sparked, an intervention of the military would be less than ideal.\n\nWe have to make a decision: We could either leave the army under the control of the government and maintain the status quo, or we could separate it completely from politics by forbidding military personnel to hold political positions. Obviously, this could make some of our officers unhappy, but ultimately it would hopefully help to secure the government from military coups."
 tur.34.a: "The army should be independent from politics."
 tur.34.b: "The army must remain under the control of the government."
 tur.35.t: "[TUR.GetName]의 라이히스팍트 가입 요청"
 tur.35.d: "After being defeated by the Cairo Pact and suffering from internal struggles for quite some time, the Turks recently managed to stabilise their nation. Hoping to once again play a role on the world stage, they've asked us if they could join the Reichspakt and fight side by side with us once more. Them joining our faction would certainly help us against the Russians, since the Turks could threaten the Caucasus and block the entrance to the Black Sea. It should also be considered that the Turks supported us in our struggle against half the world a few decades back, so why shouldn't we support them now?"
 tur.35.a: "Old friends are always welcome."
 tur.35.b: "They've lost their power. They're no longer of value."

 tur.36.a: "We shall fight side by side once more!"
 tur.37.t: "Germany Declines"
 tur.37.d: "The Germans refused to allow us to fight alongside them, citing that we are no longer of value to them because of our defeat in the Desert War. Too bad for them! May the Internationale devour them while we profit from their defeat."

 tur.38.t: "[TUR.GetName] Asks to Join the Entente"
 tur.38.d: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] wants to join our faction, which is a bold move considering that they declared war on us some twenty years ago and rejected all our economic capital. However, if we were to accept them into the Entente we would gain a foothold on the continent and strengthen our hold over the Mediterranean Sea and the Middle East."
 tur.38.a: "Of course they can join!"

 tur.39.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"

 tur.40.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 tur.40.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has refused our request to join their alliance, probably out of utter spite. Not to worry, we don't need the help of these liberal imperialists anyway. After all, the Empire rejected their devious alliance years ago - and rightfully so!"

 tur.41.a: "Dark clouds are gathering..."
 tur.42.t: "The Turks Demand the Return of their Territories"
 tur.42.d: "Those dastardly Turks have sent our government an ultimatum: Either we return all provinces which had been a part of the Ottoman Empire before the Desert War to their rule, or we shall 'face the consequences'. Today, our government will have to decide if our new territories, which rightfully belong to the Greek nation according to the Megali Idea, are something worth fighting and dying for. Even though refusing the ultimatum could lead to another war against the Turks, we have to consider how far we have come already. The Turks are now longer what they used to be, and our nation is now more powerful than ever before. For the first time in centuries, we might actually have a chance if we were to stand up against our Muslim neighbours - even if this potential victory would probably come at a great cost."
 tur.42.a: "We should accept, in the name of peace!"
 tur.42.b: "They shall have their war!"
 tur.43.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Hands over our Territories"
 tur.43.d: "Today, the Greeks have decided to show their wisdom by accepting our demands and by peacefully handing over the territories they have stolen from us after the Desert War. Finally, the Turks, whose families have been living in these provinces for generations now, are no longer oppressed by an openly hostile regime. Because of this development, we are now one step closer to the reunification of the Turkish people and have managed to regain a part of our former glory."
 tur.43.a: "That was unexpected."
 tur.44.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused"
 tur.44.d: "The Greek bastards refused to hand over the territories they have stolen from us after our defeat in the Desert War. Maybe they thought that we were bluffing and would just back down if they refused our ultimatum, but we will show them that this is not the case. It is time to strike and to remind the Greeks that they should fear our might!"
 tur.44.a: "So it begins."
 tur.45.t: "Greeks Flee the Country"
 tur.45.d: "After the Greek government gave up on the territories that were stolen from us after the Desert War, there were a few altercations between our troops and the locals, but all in all the transition remained relatively peaceful. However, some inhabitants of these territories were unhappy with the return of their Turkish overlords. They spread the rumour that the Turkish military had already planned operations aimed at the Greek civilians in order to 'turkify' the nation and to prevent our Aegean territories from falling to the Greeks once more. Even though this was a blatant lie and we clearly aren't the barbarians they made us out to be, they've managed to convince other Greeks to join them in their exodus back to their home country, promising that they'll be save from the 'Turkish wrath' in areas like Thrace and Thessaloniki."
 tur.45.a: "Cowards."
 tur.46.t: "Turkey Wants to Recover the Levant"
 tur.46.d: "After we defeated the Ottoman Empire in the Desert War, the Turkish military was broken and their nation destabilised. However, it appears that we didn't wreck them enough. The Turks have managed to recover and are now trying to reclaim the Arab territories formerly held by the Ottoman Empire, arguing that they still have a righteous claim on these lands. Even though this is clearly false, [TUR.GetLeader] deemed this claim legitimate enough to present us with an ultimatum: Either we spit on the Syrian soldiers that left their lives fighting for the freedom of the Arab people and cede Syria to the Turks, or we stand up and fight against the Turkish oppressors once more. No matter how we decide, we should choose quickly, since Turkish troops are already massing on our border - and growing more impatient by the day."
 tur.46.a: "We have no choice but to accept..."
 tur.46.b: "We've defeated them once, we'll do it again!"
 tur.47.t: "Syria is Ours!"
 tur.47.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has given in to our demands! A part of the lands stolen from us after our defeat in the Desert War are finally in Turkish hands again! During the reign of the Ottoman Empire over the region, the Levant experienced a period of rapid development, during which many Turks and their goods and businesses settled in the provinces. Now the descendants of these brave Turkish businessmen don't have to live oppressed by an Arab regime anymore, they can live freely in the nation of their fathers!"
 tur.47.a: "I've been looking forward to this."
 tur.48.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused our Ultimatum"
 tur.48.d: "Northern Syria is a region inhabited by Arab and Turks alike. However, the young and feisty nations of the Cairo Pact believe that they alone should rule over this region and disregard the local Turks completely. Since they have refused our request to cede the Levant to us, we have no choice but to go to war in order to free our Turkish brethren living in Syria from their shackles."
 tur.48.a: "This is the end for you..."
 tur.49.t: "The Turks Demand Mosul"
 tur.49.d: "Before the Desert War, the grand city of Mosul had a sizeable Turkish population. However, after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, many Turks began migrating to Anatolia, fearing that they would otherwise face oppression and discrimination under the new Arab regime. The government of [TUR.GetNameDef] has now decided to use this exodus to their advantage. They claim that the stream of refugees shows that we aren't treating our Turkish citizens properly, and have thus requested us to cede the city of Mosul and its surrounding territories to them. Should we not comply, the Turks noted that they won't hesitate to use force to accomplish their goals. Even though most countries around us support our claim on Mosul, it may be a wise decision not to escalate the tensions and to just give in to the Turkish demands. However, we could also try to launch a preemptive strike. This would hopefully allow us to catch the Turkish troops offguard and demoralise the Turkish army before it can strike our territory."
 tur.49.a: "We cannot risk a war..."
 tur.49.b: "We will never give in!"
 tur.50.t: "Mosul is back in our Hands!"
 tur.50.d: "After a period of foreign occupation, Mosul is finally Turkish again. The people of [FROM.GetNameDef], in all their wisdom, have decided that they should not risk a war with us and that it would be better for both of our sakes to just give in to our demands. With this, we're one step closer to truly uniting the Turkish people once again."
 tur.50.a: "Affairs are going well."
 tur.51.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Chooses War!"
 tur.51.d: "The request for Mosul did not seem to please the [FROM.GetAdjective] government. Instead of complying with our demands and handing over the territories that rightfully belong to us, they chose to launch a preemptive strike, hoping to catch our troops offguard and to cause disorder within our lines. It is about time that we teach them some respect."
 tur.51.a: "Well, at least this makes them the bad guys."
 tur.52.t: "A Meeting on the Bosporus"
 tur.52.d: "This afternoon, King Edward VIII, on a visit to a member country of the Entente, stopped his yacht in the Bosporus. Mustafa Kemal, probably already awaiting the King, visited him on his boat not long thereafter. Seeing how smoothly it all went, the entire occurrence seems to have been planned in advance. Some journalists were even able to capture unique images of the Gazi in his swimming suit chatting happily with the King of England. No one knows what the true meaning of this meeting was, which sparked some speculations: While most people think that this was nothing but a friendly visit, showing that there's no longer any bad blood between the British and the Turks, others argued that this event could be the first step towards a Turkish entry into the Entente, a political move which could potentially bring Turkey back on the world stage."
 tur.52.a: "A sign of future cooperation?"
 tur.53.t: "Speech on National Sovereignty"
 tur.53.d: "This morning, at the opening of the assembly, Ismet gave an opening speech about national sovereignty: \"This event constitutes the most tangible proof of the living capacity of our people. Our history is rich in such miracles. Throughout their existence, our people have known lots of setbacks. Sometimes, it even seemed as if the entire world was against us. However, the Turkish people managed to stand up and stand strong again, no matter how hard these setbacks were. These people who yesterday were thought to be doomed to disappear rise up today. Our people have formed a significant empire on the Anatolian lands under the aegis of the children of Ertugrul. It has been the dedicated defender of the Islamic cause. Every time our people have been confronted with any disorder, they've managed to save themselves by creating new institutions and by showing the world their strength.\"\n\nAfter the speech was over and the thunderous applause died down, Ismet and other leading party officials began discussing the future of the nation and drawing up plans to save Turkey and its people."
 tur.53.a: "Selam olsun!"
 tur.54.t: "Abolition of the Achar"
 tur.54.d: "Today, the assembly voted for an important and symbolic reform: the \"abolition of the Achar\", i.e. the tithe. \"The achar is a nightmare for our peasants and farmers,\" said [TUR.GetLeader], who has made its abolition a national priority, arguing that there cannot be progress while parts of our population are still forced to live hand to mouth. Unfortunately, this tax, which is levied in kind at a rate of more than one tenth of production, is not only a source of happiness for the farmers-general and usurers, but also the Republic's main budgetary revenue. It must have taken considerable courage to even consider this reform, seeing how the economy of the nation is already suffering and the military uses up big parts of the available budget. Whilst many people, especially those living in poverty, are more than happy with this reform, some remain sceptical and are wondering how [TUR.GetLeader] plans to cover the nation's expenses from now on."
 tur.54.a: "Turkish peasants are cheering!"
 tur.55.t: "The 'Hat' Speech"
 tur.55.d: "A few days ago, Ismet Reşit gave a speech in the city of Inebolu near Kastamonu. In it, he stressed the importance of a new national dress code that could highlight the elegance of the Turkish people. He said: 'Does it make sense to daub a very precious jewel with mud? If there is a jewel inside the mud then we need to wipe away the mud in order to reveal the jewel; this is only natural and necessary. We shall wear Oxford shoes or alternately, ankle shoes from now on; and trousers, waistcoats, shirts, ties, removable collars, jackets and most naturally, hats.' The last piece of clothing on this list, the hats, seemed to be of particular importance for him. Ismet even went as far as to advocate the creation of a new law which would make it mandatory for all men to wear western-style hats in public places, basically forbidding the traditional turban and fez. By now, this speech has been published in most major newspapers and has been dubbed 'The Hat Speech'.\n\nEven though the law Ismet fantasised about has not yet been enacted, there have been some protests in eastern Anatolia against the idea of an enforced western clothing style. However, these were quickly silenced and the majority of the country is ready to embrace a new look."

 tur.56.d: "The Ottoman Empire is gone forever, and in it's place lies the syndicalist state of Turkey. The Turkish government has ruffled some feathers with its fiery rhetoric, but now the Turks seek to join the Third Internationale in syndicalist brotherhood. Shall we let them into the club?"

 tur.58.a: "It appears even fellow socialists can be savages..."
 tur.59.t: "Sultan Osman and Mustafa Kemal Killed!"
 tur.59.d: "Today, shortly after noon, a sudden explosion shook the city of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The blast came from the palace of our beloved Sultan Osman, who at the time was meeting with Grand Vizier Musta Kemal Pasha to discuss how the government should proceed now that the Empire had been shattered and crushed. Without notice nor warning, these discussions came to an early end when a hidden bomb exploded, wrecking the front of the palace and leaving bystanders in shock. Fearing for the life of their Sultan, nearby observers rushed to help, but it was all in vain. Among the debris, only the disfigured bodies of Osman, the Grand Vizier, and members of the palace guard could be found.\n\nNaturally, the untimely demise of the Sultan meant chaos. The news spread quickly, first throughout the city and then throughout the entire nation. Upon hearing of the Sultan's death, Refet Pasha decided to take his chances. Stating his fear of an imminent collapse of the nation into anarchy as the reason, he rallied the most important politicians of the opposition and the majority of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s garrison around him and marched towards the major government buildings of the city, taking control of them within the span of a few hours. The general confusion and uncertainty following the Sultan's demise prevented the remaining government officials from organising much of a resistance, and subsequently, the coup was over just as quickly as it had begun. With his position secured, Refet Pasha declared himself the new Head of State and the Ottoman Salvation Party the new government, and stated that he aims to use his powers to secure law and order in the nation and to find the terrorists responsible for the Sultan's death.\n\nHowever, this riddle might prove hard to solve, as the police have thus far found no clues that might lead to the traitors. People have, however, already started throwing wild accusations around, with some blaming Kurdish or Armenian nationalists, whilst others have even denounced Refet Pasha himself. Sadly, it seems likely that the truth is never going to be revealed."
 tur.59.a: "We weep for our Sultan and our Pasha."
 tur.60.t: "Fevzi Takes Power"
 tur.60.d: "The defeat in the Desert War was the most devastating catastrophe our nation had to experience in a very long time. We were forced to concede almost all of our non-Turkish territories, thousands of men lost their lives and even more their homes. Naturally, this led to the people losing trust in their government and especially in the capabilities of the armed forces. However, many high-ranking officers don't think that the army is at fault, shifting the entire blame to the liberal government instead. According to them, the HIF neglected the army and didn't pursue an efficient defence policy, resulting in the downfall of our once great Empire.\n\nFearing that the liberals won't be able to get the nation out of its spiral of tragedies and disasters, Field Marshal Fevzi Pasha, one of the most respected officers of our armed forces, decided to no longer sit by idly. He rallied a few politicians of the OHF around him, gathered a group of supporting officers and mobilised soldiers loyal to his cause. Then, he marched on to the centre of [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where he surrounded the liberal government. Once the HIF politicians realised that they had no realistic chance of resisting Fevzi's troops, they surrendered to the Mareşal, who then arrested them for \"treason against the Empire and its people\". After the liberals had been dealt with, Fevzi declared himself the new Head of State. Not long after the coup had concluded, he gave a speech, which was broadcasted to the entire nation over the radio. In it, he informed the people of the change in politics and assured them that from now on, their voices would be heard, and that under his lead, our nation would return to its former glory.\n\nEven though the people admire Fevzi for his military achievements, many still question his ability to govern the nation efficiently. Seeing how Fevzi was once a dear friend of Kemal, some also fear that his coup will mean a return to the policies of the OHF - which are dreaded by some parts of the population. Only time will tell if the fears and uncertainties of the people are justified..."
 tur.60.a: "Let's see what the future will bring."
 tur.61.t: "The Enemy Reveals Itself"
 tur.61.d: "When he took power, the Mareşal promised that he'd use his powers to secure the continued survival of our nation and to fight the enemies of the state. Until now, it has been left deliberately unclear who exactly these enemies are, but today, Fevzi decided to answer this question in a speech.\n\n\"When I look at the Empire, I see a once great nation that has been utterly destroyed by its enemies. And I see these enemies kicking our state while it's already down. My Turkish friends, you might be asking yourselves: 'Who are these enemies you are seeing?' Well, this is a question I will gladly answer. The first enemy I can see is the liberal opposition to my rule. Many of the idiotic members of the former HIF still haven't realised that it was their system that led to the downfall of the Empire - and that their system would mean the total nullification of any chance our nation still has to return to its former glory. This is why I will fight these liberal pigs with everything I have until their brains are finally freed of the leftist poison. But, this is not all. I see another enemy. One that has emerged after our defeat in the Desert War. This enemy is our current economic situation. It prevents us from reaching the prosperity and peace all of us desire. We cannot grow if our economy is destroyed and our production rate minuscule. We'll have to rebuild our economy before we can start thinking about anything else.\"\n\nWith these words, Fevzi has made his priorities clear. Now, all that remains to be seen is how he will go about defeating the enemies that he has now revealed, and if the population agrees with this new enemy image."
 tur.61.a: "He has quite the task ahead of him."
 tur.62.t: "Fevzi, Saviour of the Nation"
 tur.62.d: "In the midst of the chaos of the aftermath of the Desert War, one man decided to take action. One man decided to pursue any actions he deemed necessary to ensure the continued survival of our nation. This man was Fevzi Pasha. By taking over the government, which is still regarded as a highly questionable, if not outright criminal, move by some, he was able to take control of the nation's rebuilding process. Although leading the completion of said process was without a doubt not an easy task, it presented Fevzi with an opportunity to reshape the state in accordance with his own visions - and he did not hesitate to use this opportunity to the fullest. However, in order to achieve this goal, he first saw himself forced to crack down on those standing in his way, which led to him being perceived by many as a \"ruler with an iron fist\".\n\nEven so, now that the dust has settled and stability has returned to the realm, most people appear to agree that the benefits brought by the Mareşal's rule outweigh the harm he has done. Throughout the country, the opposition voices are slowly growing ever more quiet, and it seems like the population is growing increasingly content with their new government, with some even calling the Mareşal the \"saviour of the Turkish nation\". With the day-to-day lives of the Turkish people slowly but surely returning to normal, hopes are high that the new era of Turkish prosperity and prestige Fevzi has promised is about to begin."
 tur.62.a: "We applaud the Mareşal!"
 tur.63.t: "The Mareşal Reinstates the Parliament"
 tur.63.d: "Keeping true to his promises, the Mareşal has decided not to abuse his emergency powers to centralise the entire authority around himself, but to reinstate the Turkish parliament instead. However, Fevzi was nevertheless unwilling to resign from his current position as Head of State, leading him to establish a more controlled form of democracy with himself at the top. Despite these drawbacks, this move has at least partially satisfied many supporters of a multi-party system. Seeing how the THF is not the only electable party in the upcoming legislative election, our citizens have high hopes that it will bring some much needed fresh air and a few new faces into the political scene of our nation.\n\nStill, considering how many people trust the Mareşal deeply and how he still holds on to much of his powers, it can be assumed that the THF will likely keep its majority in the parliament. Thus, this election probably won't change too much politically, but will first and foremost serve as a way to legitimise Fevzi's rule and his decision to keep his current position."
 tur.63.a: "A step in the right direction."
 tur.64.t: "Fevzi's Lies Exposed"
 tur.64.d: "After the Mareşal reinstated the parliament, the people were quite content with the new democratic system. However, this has changed now that a scandal has rocked the nation.\n\nA few times by now, the Mareşal has been spotted together with some of the leaders of the opposition parties. Of course, this would have been nothing out of the ordinary if it had been during a political debate in parliament. However, he and his political opponents were seen walking through [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where they were probably on their way to Fevzi's home in the centre of the city. According to the reports of the citizens that saw them, it appears that they are, in fact, not fierce political opponents, but rather the dearest of friends. Some people even reported this to the major newspapers - and they didn't hesitate before getting to work on a new article. Now, newspapers with headlines such as \"Fevzi's lies exposed!\" are selling like hot cakes all across the country.\n\nNaturally, this scandal has sparked quite the controversy. Some people are trying to defend Fevzi, arguing that it's normal for a man like him to have good relations even with political enemies and that this news doesn't change anything about the sacrifices he has made for the nation and the people. Furthermore, there are also some doubting the trustworthiness of the reports, as none of the witnesses could provide any pictures of the incident and the newspapers were probably just looking for a good-selling story. On the other hand, there's also a sizeable portion of our population confident that these reports are evidence enough of Fevzi's ambitions to undermine the democracy he's officially been trying to preserve. Now they've started asking themselves: Has Fevzi been working against democracy? Has he been building a kingdom of hypocrisy this entire time? And, most importantly, does he really do everything in his power to defend the common folk?\nSadly, only the Mareşal himself knows the answers to these questions."
 tur.64.a: "A shocking scandal - or just panicmongering?"
 tur.65.t: "Proclamation of the Turkish Republic"
 tur.65.d: "Today, the Mareşal gave a speech, in which he officially announced the birth of the Türkiye Cumhuriyeti, the Republic of Turkey. In his speech, Fevzi said: \"We are no longer Ottomans. We have lost the Desert War and with it our claim to the title 'Ottoman'. We have to let the past die. We shall no longer look to it in awe. We shall look to the future and try to make the best of our current situation, which isn't as bad as it may seem at first glance. Though we have lost much of our former glory, our nation is more united than ever before. All across the country, Turkish hearts beat in unison. It is those hearts that the nation should belong to, which is why I hereby proclaim the Republic of Turkey!\"\n\nAfter this part of his speech, the Mareşal spoke about his plans for the future. About the industrial advances Turkey would experience under his rule, about the possible establishment of a democratic system, and about his goal of regaining the respect of the nations around us.\n\nThough the more liberal parts of our population nevertheless question Fevzi's wish to establish a real democracy, the speech and news were overall received quite well by the majority of our citizens, and Turks all across the country hope that this day marks the beginning of a new era of Turkish sovereignty, peace, and stability."
 tur.65.a: "A new era begins!"
 tur.66.t: "Fear of the Religious Community"
 tur.66.d: "Unsurprisingly, considering the secularistic policy Kemal and his followers pursued, seeing the OHF, nowadays known as the THF, once again rise to power sparked fear in the ranks of the religious orders. While the leaders of these orders are mostly afraid of losing their political influence and riches, they are also concerned about the possibility of the nation disregarding the traditional values of Islam and fear that Islamic pratices may be expelled from the day-to-day lives of the Turkish people. To counter this possible development, some of the orders already organised protests against the THF government and have requested the support of all \"true Muslims\" in their struggle against secularisation. However, because the majority of the people still stand behind [TUR.GetLeader], these protests have thus far stayed small in scale and the calls of their leaders only been answered by a few diehard conservatives. Nevertheless, it would probably be a wise idea to try and calm the orders before they use their influence to expand their demonstrations."
 tur.66.a: "Their fear is unreasonable, right?"
 tur.67.t: "Turkey, Vanguard of Stability and Modernisation"
 tur.67.d: "After all the hard work done by [TUR.GetLeader] and his government, Turkey can now truly be considered the vanguard of stability and modernisation. Turkey has a formal and written constitution, first elections have taken place, and the people are generally content and place trust in their government and their leader. No longer should [TUR.GetNameDef] be considered inferior to the nations of the west. Even if the governments of these countries don't like to admit it, we have even surpassed some of them when it comes to the implementation of civil rights and modernisation in general. We have become a shining beacon in the Middle East, a sign of hope and an icon of a brighter future. Hopefully, other nations, especially our Arabian neighbours, will follow our lead."
 tur.67.a: "The future begins now!"
 tur.68.t: "알렉산드레타 문제"
 tur.68.d: "In the aftermath of the Desert War, the province of Iskenderun, also known as Alexandretta, was stolen from us by the Syrians. This region has been a part of the Ottoman Empire for about 400 years prior to its annexation by the Syrians and has a population that is mainly made up of Turks, making the loss of the province even more painful. Many political parties, especially the nationalists, still consider Iskenderun a rightful part of Anatolia, and thus advocate for its reintegration into [TUR.GetNameDef]. To achieve this goal, we'd have to remind the Turks living in the area of their allegiance to our state and bring them to put pressure on the Syrian government. This will force the Syrians to either accept the will of the people and let the Turks of Alexandretta rejoin our nation, or reveal their vile and imperialistic ambitions to the world, giving us a justification to take back Iskenderun by force."
 tur.68.a: "We will unite our people!"
 tur.69.t: "Our Relations with the New Iraqi State"
 tur.69.d: "After our defeat in the Desert War, new nations arose in the entire Middle East. Among them was the young nation of Iraq, which had been a part of the Ottoman Empire since it had been conquered by Sultan Selim I in 1534. Naturally, after such a long time, the province grew quite close to Kostantiniyye. Because of this, Iraq, unlike other Arab nations, does not hate us with every fibre of their being. This gives us the opportunity to reestablish diplomatic relations with the young state and allows us to fight the influence the Egyptians have over the most eastern part of the Arab world. Conveniently, this would also give us access to the rich Iraqi oil fields and thus help boost our economy. Seeing how the Iraqis are being threatened by the Iranians, who view Iraq as an integral part of their nation, they surely wouldn't say no to a new friend in the region that could possibly help in the defence of their homeland."
 tur.69.a: "Let's hope the Iraqis will accept our reconcilement."
 tur.70.t: "Iskenderun Votes for Secession"
 tur.70.d: "A few days ago, we demanded the organisation of a referendum concerning the status of the province of Iskenderun. The goal of said referendum was to let the people decide if they want to stay a part of [SYR.GetNameDef], or if they rather want to become a part of our glorious nation once again. Surprisingly, it appears that the regional government of Iskenderun has decided to accept our request, probably thinking that the people of Alexandretta have been indoctrinated enough by the [SYR.GetAdjective] regime to think that they'd be better off upholding the current status quo.\n\nToday, the referendum was finally held and the votes were counted. The result - an overwhelming majority of Iskenderun's population voted for secession, and thus voiced their wish to reunite with our state. Whilst this was to be expected, seeing as the province is still predominantly inhabited by Turks that feel attached to [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], it's still good to see that the [SYR.GetAdjective] government has not yet managed to corrupt their minds. Now we shall wait and see if our neighbours accept this result, or if they want to contest it."
 tur.70.a: "Let's hope the [SYR.GetAdjective] government accepts this."
 tur.71.t: "Iskenderun Votes for Secession"
 tur.71.d: "Earlier this week, a referendum was held in the province of Iskenderun, also known as Alexandretta. The referendum was an initiative of the Turks, who still haven't gotten over their defeat in the Desert War. However, instead of trying to regain control of the province by force, the Turks decided to give the citizens of Iskenderun the right to self-determination. The goal of the referendum was to let the people decide if they want to stay a part of our nation or become a part of [TUR.GetNameDef] instead.\n\nOnce the votes were finally counted, it became apparent that the Turks had poisoned the minds of our people with far greater efficiency than we initially thought. With an overwhelming majority, the population of Iskenderun voted to secede from our country and thus demanded the reintegration of the province into [TUR.GetNameDef]. Of course, it is up to us to decide if we want to accept the results of this obviously rigged election and lead the people of Alexandretta to their certain doom, or if we want to ignore the referendum and uphold our control of the province. However, the latter approach could be used by the Turks to justify a new war, which would surely cause many unnecessary deaths. How should we decide?"
 tur.71.a: "We'll listen to the people."
 tur.71.b: "We shall keep the province."
 tur.72.t: "Iskenderun Votes to Stay"
 tur.72.d: "Earlier this week, a referendum was held in the province of Iskenderun, also known as Alexandretta. The referendum was an initiative of the Turks, who still haven't gotten over their defeat in the Desert War. However, instead of trying to regain control of the province by force, the Turks decided to give the citizens of Iskenderun the right to self-determination. The goal of the referendum was to let the people decide if they want to stay a part of our nation or become a part of [TUR.GetNameDef] instead.\n\nOnce the votes were finally counted, it became apparent that the people of Alexandretta had realised that we aren't as bad as the [TUR.GetAdjective] government claims us to be. With an overwhelming majority, the population of Iskenderun voted to stay a part of our country - showing the Turks that they are no longer wanted in the province. This must have hit the Turks hard, considering they were the ones to advocate the referendum, thinking it would surely result in the people voting for secession. On the other hand, our rule over Iskenderun has now been legitimised, meaning that from now on no other country can contest our ownership of the region without violating the right of men to self-determination."
 tur.72.a: "This should settle the matter."
 tur.74.t: "Iskenderun Votes to Stay"
 tur.74.d: "A few days ago, we demanded the organisation of a referendum concerning the status of the province of Iskenderun. The goal of said referendum was to let the people decide if they want to stay a part of [SYR.GetNameDef], or if they rather want to become a part of our glorious nation once again. Surprisingly, it appears that the regional government of Iskenderun has decided to accept our request, probably thinking that the people of Alexandretta have been indoctrinated enough by the [SYR.GetAdjective] regime to think that they'd be better off upholding the current status quo.\n\nToday, the referendum was finally held and the votes were counted. The result - a majority of voters chose to stay a part of [SYR.GetNameDef]. This of course cannot be true, seeing as the province is still predominantly inhabited by Turks that feel attached to [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Somehow, the [SYR.GetAdjective] government must have rigged the referendum. By doing this, our neighbours have shown the world that they don't give a damn about the people's right to self-determination. However, we shall not let ourselves be tricked this easily, and will not back down until Iskenderun returns to our righteous rule!"
 tur.74.a: "This is outrageous!"
 tur.75.t: "Iskenderun Joins our Nation!"
 tur.75.d: "At long last, we finally managed to reunite with our Turkish brethren in Iskenderun! Our efforts to remind the people of their allegiance to [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have paid off and helped inspire the Turkish population of the region to revolt against the Syrian government. Caught offguard by the quickly growing civil unrest, the local administration had no choice but to accept the wish of the people to reintegrate the province into [TUR.GetNameDef]. The fact that many local gouverneurs are also of Turkish descent and thus sympathised with the unification movement only facilitated this process. Now we shall wait and see how the Syrians react to us reclaiming our rightful territory."
 tur.75.a: "Reunited at last!"
 tur.76.t: "Iskenderun Secedes from our Nation!"
 tur.76.d: "The dastardly Turkish bastards have secretly been working on propaganda campaigns to persuade the population of Iskenderun into revolting against us. Sadly, the people of the region failed to use their brains and fell victim to the blatant lies told by the Turks. Their minds poisoned, they pressured the local government into accepting the secession of Alexandretta and the reintegration of the region into [TUR.GetNameDef]. The government in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has already declared this event a \"deserved victory of the Turkish people\", however, the tale doesn't have to end here. We still have the option to fight back, but if we hesitate now, we may never have a chance to recover our rightful territory ever again."
 tur.76.a: "How dare they?!"
 tur.76.b: "There's nothing we can do about it..."
 tur.77.t: "Turkey Wants to Restore Relations"
 tur.77.d: "Today, an envoy from [TUR.GetNameDef] arrived in our capital. Apparently, the Turks don't have any hard feelings because of our secession from the empire. Instead, they want to reestablish diplomatic relations between our countries, saying that even now that our two states have been parted, we should work together to ensure the safety and prosperity of our people. Seeing how the Persians are eyeing up our land, it might be a wise idea to get a new friend on our side that could help us defend our homeland and maybe even scare the Persians away. However, some fear that the Turks might be trying to diplomatically isolate us from our Arab allies and thus make us dependant on [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], both economically and militarily. How should we respond to the Turkish offer?"
 tur.77.a: "Let us walk into the future together!"
 tur.77.b: "We don't need them!"
 tur.78.t: "Iraq Refused!"
 tur.78.d: "The Iraqis refused our diplomatic approachment, fearing that our intentions are not as pure as they may seem and that we might be planning something behind our back. Although this is of course not the case, there's nothing we can do about it right now. Sadly, it appears that trying to foster a friendship between Arabs and Turks is an impossible endeavour."
 tur.78.a: "Their loss."
 tur.79.t: "Iraq Accepted!"
 tur.79.d: "It appears that the people of Iraq are still as wise as they were in ancient times, seeing how they decided to accept our diplomatic approachment, citing that a friendship between our two countries would benefit us both. Now we shall march on together - for a brighter future!"
 tur.79.a: "May this relationship bring nothing but prosperity!"
 tur.80.t: "Turkish State Visit"
 tur.80.d: "Today, [TUR.GetLeader] paid our nation an official state visit, which had been planned and organised for quite a while now. After he arrived at an airport near [IRQ.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where he was greeted by a 21-gun salute, an ambassador led him and his personal guards into the heart of the capital, where [IRQ.GetLeader] was already waiting. While they drove through the streets of the city, many people came out of their houses to take a look at our guest of honour, cheering happily as he drove by. The meeting between the two heads of state began with the exchanging of gifts: [TUR.GetLeader] brought a nazar-amulet, some Turkish delight and a few valuable Turkish carpets, while [IRQ.GetLeader] gifted his new Turkish friend a small collection of ancient coins, which have been found in the region of Mesopotamia. After that, a state dinner was held, in which only the most magnificent Iraqi meals were served. Afterwards, the two visited a military graveyard, where [TUR.GetLeader] laid a wreath as a symbolic gesture, applauding the bravery of the Iraqi soldiers.\n\nAs the day came to an end, it was about time for [TUR.GetLeader] to get back to the airport. On the way there, he and [IRQ.GetLeader] chatted happily, as if they were old friends that had known each other for years now. However, all good things must end eventually, and so [TUR.GetLeader] boarded his plane, looked back one last time, and began his trip back to [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
 tur.80.a: "We wish him a good home trip!"
 tur.81.t: "The Turks Recognise our Independence"
 tur.81.d: "Now that diplomatic relations between our two countries have formally been restored, the next logical step was for the Turks to officially recognise us as an independent nation. By doing this, they also renounced any claims they still had on our territory and accepted our ownership of the former Ottoman provinces. Even though most of the Arab nations already recognised us and do not care about what the Turks say, this move strengthened the legitimacy of our government in the eyes of the rest of the world and thus also helped increase our diplomatic weight on a global level."
 tur.81.a: "Wonderful!"
 tur.82.t: "Turkish-Iraqi Economic Accord"
 tur.82.d: "A few days ago, representatives of the [TUR.GetAdjective] government met a few deputies of our government in Baghdad to discuss the possibility of an economic accord. The goal of said accord was to increase the prosperity of our two nations by encouraging trade across our borders. The negotiations were relatively short and resulted in a treaty that formally abolished tariffs on goods being transported between our two nations, as well as reducing border controls in order to unburden the flow of goods. Most importantly, this treaty will give us easier access to the Turkish minerals, while the Turks will benefit from our oil fields."
 tur.82.a: "A truly wonderful arrangement!"
 tur.83.t: "Turkish-Iraqi Mutual Protection Treaty"
 tur.83.d: "With global and regional tensions rising, one needs allies if he wants to survive the century. Cause of this, the [TUR.GetAdjective] government proposed the signing of a mutual protection treaty between our two nations. Seeing how this would secure us another layer of protection against the threats currently breathing down our neck, [IRQ.GetLeader] didn't have to think long before he accepted the proposal. Hopefully, this will ensure the safety of our people and deter other nations from attacking us or our new Turkish friends."
 tur.83.a: "For a safe future!"
 tur.84.t: "[TUR.GetNameDef] claims Salonica!"
 tur.84.d: "Using the state of war between our two countries, the Turks have expanded their war aims even further, to now include [989.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as well. Claiming that they need to 'reclaim the Home of the Revolution' from us, they are now laying claim not only to the city, but the surrounding regions as well, trying to return to a state of affairs from before the Weltkrieg."
 tur.84.a: "It is all or nothing now."
 tur.90.t: "Kurdish Independentist Sentiment"
 tur.90.d: "The majority of what would be considered Kurdistan has been controlled by us for about 400 years now. Nevertheless, we haven't managed to centralise the Kurdish territories because the Kurds don't see themselves as a part of [TUR.GetNameDef], pledging allegiance to their tribal chiefs instead. Despite our best efforts, we were unable to integrate them into the rest of our country and still haven't managed to supress their will to fight for their independence. Cause of this, there have been numerous Kurdish revolts before and during the Weltkrieg, which have all been beaten down by our military might. The fear of our soldiers and their cruelty was the only thing keeping the Kurds at bay - most of the time, that is.\n\nOur defeat in the Desert War and the catastrophic state our military is in right now gave the Kurds new hope. Slowly but surely, the Kurdish chiefs are beginning to settle their differences, allowing them to focus on their common enemy: [TUR.GetNameDef]. Considering our momentary weakness, a Kurdish revolt could have disastrous consequences. We'll have to react one way or another - before the Kurds see their time to strike and unite under one banner against us."
 tur.90.a: "Do they really think they can get away with this?!"
 tur.91.t: "Kurdish Situation Appeased"
 tur.91.d: "It appears that all of our efforts were not in vain. Finally, after decades, if not centuries, of the Kurds opposing our rule and ignoring our righteous claim on their land, the situation in the region seems to have stabilised. Rebel organisations were crushed and their leaders arrested, reducing the influence these agitators had on the rest of the population to a minimum. Paired with the increased police presence in major cities and on the most important roads, these measures reminded the Kurds that the Turkish people are strong, even after their defeat in the Desert War. Also, our investments in the Kurdish provinces, including literacy campaigns and the expansion of infrastructure, made the Kurds realise that we aren't as bad as some of their chiefs claim us to be. After all, if they were independent from our rule, they wouldn't have had the means needed for such programmes. Slowly but surely, they are beginning to accept that our rule is what's best for them."
 tur.91.a: "Finally, inner peace."
 tur.92.t: "The Kurdish Revolt"
 tur.92.d: "A few days ago, the Sheikhs, Aghas and Chiefs of Kurdistan met in Diyarbakir to discuss the future of their people. Initially, nobody thought that they would come to an agreement, considering how many of them were archenemies not that long ago. Surprisingly, the meeting didn't fall apart instantly. In fact, the discussion stayed relatively civil and without any unexpected incidents. It appears that they've realised that they're stronger if they fight united and under one banner - a dangerous sign. About a day after the meeting started, it became clear that the majority of the Kurdish leaders were in favour of Kurdish independence, saying that they want to free their people from their Turkish overlords. This led them to proclaim the independence of the State of Kurdistan this morning. Knowing that we'll never accept this, they immediately thereafter called the Kurds to arms, claiming that this fight will finally bring them their long-desired freedom from the \"Turkish yoke\". Thousands are heeding the call and joining the revolt against our rule. However, there are barely any experienced soldiers within the ranks of the Kurds, which consist mostly of inexperienced farmers, nomads and tribesmen. This means that our army, although not in a very good state, should have no problem dealing with this revolt. It's about time we show the Kurds their place!"
 tur.92.a: "Independence?! For the Kurds?! Not on my watch!"
 tur.93.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Cede Alexandretta"
 tur.93.d: "The vicious government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has elected to ignore the desires of their Turkish citizens, whose only wish was to finally be reunited with their brethren in Anatolia. This outrageous act violates the right to self-determination of the Turks of Iskenderun and thus could very well be used as a justification for military actions against the Syrian government. However, some members of our government fear that a declaration of war could lead to our demise, considering we already lost to the Syrians when they were but a group of unorganised rebels. We'll have to decide if Alexandretta is worth the hassle."
 tur.93.a: "We'll teach them a lesson!"
 tur.93.b: "Nothing we can do about it..."
 tur.94.t: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap]의 베오그라드 협약 가입 희망"
 tur.94.d: "Today, truly surprising news reached the capital. The Turks, after being beaten down in the Desert War, decided that they should find some new friends. This led them directly to our doorstep - and to the Turks asking to join the Belgrade Pact. Naturally, this has sparked some controversy. Many still remember the First Balkan War, a bloody conflict, which we fought together with our Balkan allies against the Turks. A glance at an even more distant past also shows the roots of some wounds that to this day haven't fully healed. During the reign of the Ottoman Empire over Serbia, the Turks didn't hesitate to crush any rebellions with an unprecedented cruelty. This, for many, is a crime that cannot be forgiven. Not today and not in the future.\n\nHowever, some others also argue that these disputes, as heavy as they may be, lie in the distant past and should thus not dictate the political development of today. They think that it's about time to bury the hatchet and look to the future not as enemies, but as brothers in arms."
 tur.94.a: "Welcome the Turks into the Pact!"
 tur.94.b: "Do they think we can forget what they've done?!"
 tur.95.t: "The Serbs Accepted our Request"
 tur.95.d: "Today is an important day for the entire Balkans! [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has decided to accept our request to join the Belgrade Pact, welcoming us into the military alliance. By doing this, they've also officially forgiven us for the crimes committed against the Serbs during the reign of the Ottoman Empire over the country, finally bringing about a reconciliation between our two nations. This marks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the Balkans."
 tur.95.a: "This day shall go down in history!"
 tur.96.t: "The Serbs Denied our Request"
 tur.96.d: "Sadly, the Serbs decided that they would rather live in the past than in the future. Citing the crimes committed by the Ottoman Empire during its reign over Serbia as the reason, they declined our request to join the Belgrade Pact. It appears that the people of the Balkans just can't get over their differences that easily."
 tur.96.a: "We're better off without them anyways."
 tur.97.t: "The Mareşal Publishes an Autobiography"
 tur.97.d: "After the nation had stabilised, Fevzi Pasha began turning his attention towards literature. His goal was to create an autobiography of himself, one which would inspire the reader and explain his motives and measures to him. A few weeks ago, Fevzi finally finished his work. Thousands of copies were printed almost immediately thereafter, and then sent to book stores all across the nation in a hurry. The first reviews by critics were almost unanimously positive, with the majority of them saying that the autobiography is truly a work of quality, shows the Mareşal in a completely new light, and is something everyone who wants to truly understand our leader should have read at least once.\n\nIn most stores, the books were sold out within the first few days, with many Turkish families being eager to find out more about their leader. Now, the streets are filled with people enjoying Fevzi's work and story. Cafes are full of men reading it, neighbourhood meetings are getting dominated by discussions about it, and there are even some members of the OHF advocating the incorporation of the biography into the curriculum, arguing that every child should know about the story of the Mareşal and the struggles he had to endure. By now, Fevzi's autobiography has become a well-known piece of literature in the entire country, and it's probably going to be regarded as one of the most important Turkish books of the 20th century in the future."
 tur.97.a: "A fine piece of literature."
 tur.98.t: "Fevzi's Tank Exercises"
 tur.98.d: "For the Mareşal, it has always been of utmost importance that the Turkish nation and her people embrace the modernity he advocates. However, unlike others who want to prioritise the modernisation of the industry and the government, the Mareşal thinks that the military should be our focus. This, of course, means the amplified use of tanks in the armed forces - a step many of our officers, especially the older ones, dread, since it also indicates that they'll have to study entirely new tactics and strategies.\n\nUnlike other high-ranking officers, the Mareşal didn't let himself get intimidated by this fact. A few days ago, he decided to lead the charge and organise a tremendous tank exercise. By doing so, he wanted to learn about the new ways of warfare and be a good example for the other officers. This week, it was finally time for the drill to begin. During the exercise, the Field Marshal ordered the tank battalion under his command to drive in various formations, and from time to time ordered his tanks to take strategic positions and open fire on specific targets - hills, trees, and even some abandoned buildings.\n\nOverall, the exercise turned out to be quite a success. The soldiers involved are now familiar with basic strategies of armoured warfare, and many officers are more than eager to conduct similar exercises in order to enhance their own abilities as tank commanders. As for the Mareşal himself, he appears to have grown quite fond of tank warfare, has already picked up a few basic tactics, and has been working tirelessly on working out new strategies and formations. Now all that remains to be seen is if he can use them as efficiently on the real battlefield as he did during the exercise."
 tur.98.a: "The modern battle field awaits!"
 tur.99.t: "The Position of Prime Minister"
 tur.99.d: "When [TUR.GetLeader] assumed the office of president, he effectively unified two positions that are strictly separated in many countries. Seeing as he now holds most of the power in our government and enjoys almost unlimited freedoms, some members of the party have begun to question if it wouldn't be a better idea to split the offices of prime minister and president in order to guarantee the separation of powers.\n\nDoing so would reduce [TUR.GetLeader] to a figurehead with mostly representative tasks. These would include state visits to other countries, speeches for our people and the management of the government's welfare programmes. Meanwhile, the prime minister would become the embodiment of the legislature and set our main political goals. The influence he would have on our nation's politics should not be underestimated, which is why we should choose someone close to Kemal for this office, lest our nation deviate from the course the Gazi has set in his will. Already, parliament has decided on a man that would be perfect for the job: Celal Bayar, an advocate of a democratic system and close associate of Mustafa Kemal.\n\nAlthough Bayar would surely do a great job and be more than grateful to get an opportunity to carry the flame that the Gazi has ignited, we could also just stick with [TUR.GetLeader] and let him keep both positions. While this would also let him keep the powers that a minority of the party deems a threat to democracy, [TUR.GetLeader] has proven his capabilities and his good intentions through and through. Stripping away a part of his powers could severly hurt our nation if they land in the hands of a man only half as competent as him. Now, parliament will have to decide if wants to entirely entrust the future of our nation to [TUR.GetLeader], or if it wants to separate his powers and give Celal a chance to prove his worth."
 tur.99.a: "The positions of president and prime minister should be merged!"
 tur.99.b: "They should be separated! Celal will surely do a great job."
 tur.100.t: "Ankara, the New Home of the Turkish People"
 tur.100.d: "Kostantiniyye has been our nation's capital since it has been conquered by Sultan Mehmed II in 1453. Sadly, in the past few years Kostantiniyye has lost much of the glory and glamour that once earned it the name 'city of the world's desire'. It has become a place of political intrigue and has been corrupted by the schemes of those hungry for power. While this had also been a problem in past centuries, with numerous sultans dying prematurely or being forced to abdicate the throne, the situation developed into a nightmare as the end of the Empire drew closer. The general political instability in the capital, which had been amplified by the outbreak of the Desert War, has caused numerous assassination attempts, the formation of various secret organisations and a general mistrust and dissent in the population.\n\nA few weeks back, [TUR.GetLeader] and his government have decided that this polluted and corrupted city should no longer be considered the home of the Turkish people. Instead, they think the capital of the Turkish state should lie in the hills of Anatolia, in the city of Ankara. Its central position makes the city both of strategical and of geopolitical importance, and ensures that our citizens living on our eastern border no longer feel like they're being ruled from a capital that lies far away on the other side of the world. While some have pointed out that Ankara is a relatively poor city and should thus not represent the entire nation of Turkey, [TUR.GetLeader] insists on his decision, arguing that relocating our capital into the area will foster the economic growth of the city. Furthermore, he has also planned the expansion of the Ankara's infrastructure in order to make it more appealing to the outside world."
 tur.100.a: "Good riddance, Kostantiniyye!"
 tur.101.t: "A New Turkish Anthem"
 tur.101.d: "To further bolster Turkish nationalism and to break with the Ottoman traditions even more, it has been decided that our nation needs a new national anthem. This anthem is supposed to represent everything the Turkish people stand for, and should be something we can sing with pride in front of the entire world. The search for a fitting song has been nailed down to two main candidates: Ceddin Deden and Kafkasya Marşı.\n\nCeddin Deden or Your Ancestor Is Your Grandfather is a song with relatively short text and a memorable melody, making it easy to learn even for children still in elementary school. It emphasises the heroic nature of the Turkish people and stresses the greatness of our ancestors that have conquered the lands we now call our home. The overall very nationalistic lyrics of Ceddin Deden show our people that they can be proud of being born Turkish, making it the perfect song to represent our nation.\n\nMeanwhile, Kafkasya Marşı or March of Caucasia focuses more on our brave soldiers. It tells the tale of our victories high up in the mountains of the Caucasus, where our men showed their courage and forced the enemy to retreat. While Kafkasya Marşı is overall more militaristic than Ceddin Deden, it more or less has the same message: the Turkish people are of heroic nature and should be proud of who they are."
 tur.101.a: "조상 대대로!"
 tur.101.b: "캅카스 행진곡!"
 tur.102.t: "The Hard-Working Men of Turkey"
 tur.102.d: "With [TUR.GetLeader] now leading our nation, he has decided that it is about time to visit the diligent and hard-working men of Turkey, many of whom live under relatively poor conditions. Right after taking office, he embarked on a journey through Anatolia, visiting many villages and speaking with the locals in order to get an idea of the situation at hands in the rural areas, and to ensure that the working population knows they're not alone in their struggles. What he saw shocked him deeply. Many of the pure souls living scattered throughout Anatolia have to work all day long, only to receive nothing but breadline wages. They're forced to live in relative poverty while people living in the cities enjoy a prosperous lifestyle. After his tour was over, [TUR.GetLeader] was more convinced than ever that something needed to be done.\n\nToday, he gave a speech in front of the new government palace in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. In it, he applauded the Turkish workers, thanking them for their services and assuring that he will do everything in his power to improve their living situation. Furthermore, he emphasised the necessity of a classless society, one in which people can live in equality and prosperity, without being hindered in their development by their social status. Throughout the country, the people believe that their cries have finally been heard. They hope that [TUR.GetLeader]'s intentions are as pure as his fine words made them out to be, and are slowly but surely regaining their trust in the government. Finally, they are beginning to see a light in the darkness that has become their lives."

 tur.103.t: "A Busy Day in Paris"
 tur.103.d: "Yesterday morning, Recep Peker and Sevket Süreyya Aydemir took a flight to Paris in order to see how good life in the Commune really is. After arriving at the airport and performing some formalities, they took a tour through the city, visiting its greatest sights. They dropped by the famous Eiffel Tower and even climbed up to the second level to get an overview of the entire city. Peker and Aydemir described it as a phenomenal experience, and the city itself as thoroughly beautiful. After spending some time in Notre-Dame and catching a glimpse of the Place de la Concorde and the Arc de Triomphe, [FRA.GetLeader] invited them to an official state dinner, in which traditional French dishes, like Cassoulet, Chicken confit and Lyonnaise Salad, were served, much to the delight of the two guests of honour.\n\nAfter the dinner, Aydemir and Peker used their remaining hours to visit the Communard parliament, the Bourse Générale du Travail. There, French politicians congratulated them for the achievements they have reached thus far and gave them some good advice on how to improve the nation of Turkey even more. After some interesting conversations, Peker held a short speech in front of the parliament, praising the present politicians for the utopia they have created and wishing them and their nation peace and prosperity. Once the speech, which was answered by thunderous applause, concluded, the day was nearing its end and it was time for Peker and Aydemir to take their flight back to [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. They wished the French a final farewell and soon found themselves back in Turkey, where they realised just how much will need to be done until Turkey will become a jewel as shining as the Commune of France."

 tur.104.t: "Inauguration of the \"Reşat Çiğiltepe Memorial\""
 tur.104.d: "Reşat Çiğiltepe was a famous and renowned officer of the Ottoman army and even earned the respect of Mustafa Kemal himself for his victories during the Weltkrieg. He had always been a loyal defender of Turkey and her people, and stayed true to Kemal and his cause even after the Gazi's untimely death. Sadly, his loyalty was rewarded with a bullet to the chest, delivered by the men of General Fahrettin Pasha, who tried to stage a coup right after Kemal had died. Çiğiltepe, who was present in the capital at the time, was one of the first officers to organise the resistance, and tried to free the Sublime Porte from Fahrettin and his followers. Even though he was outnumbered and outgunned, he fought bravely until the end, side by side with his fellow soldiers. This gave Ismet enough time to muster an army that could defeat the defectors, and thus essentially saved [ROOT.GetNameDef].\n\nTo ensure that this sacrifice will never be forgotten, [ROOT.GetLeader] has ordered the construction of a memorial dedicated to Reşat Çiğiltepe and his brave soldiers. Today, it was finally time for the memorial to be inaugurated. After a patriotic and emotional speech about the heroism that Çiğiltepe proved that day, [ROOT.GetLeader] and the crowd present at the ceremony held a minute of silence to commemorate the sacrifice of these brave souls. They will forever be an example for the Turkish people, and showed our soldiers what true bravery looks like."

 tur.105.t: "Syria Hands Over Iskenderun"
 tur.105.d: "Heeding Iskenderun's call for reunification with their Turkish brethren, the Syrian government has chosen not to stand against the will of its citizens. In an official meeting between representatives from both of our governments, it was decided that the province should once again be returned to our hands. By doing so, the Syrians hope to better their relations with our new state whilst also reducing the tensions along the border. Naturally, news of this development was well received by our population, and especially in Iskenderun, parades celebrating the reunification of the Turkish people are still being held. This enthusiasm also extends to our politicians, who are more than content with the fact that diplomacy has proven to be a more effective tool than warfare. Once again, it has been shown that the pen is indeed mightier than the sword."
 tur.105.a: "Reunited at last!"
 tur.106.t: "An Official Opponent"
 tur.106.d: "The republic has been proclaimed and democracy has been established! This development has largely restored the people's trust in the government, and even after weeks, the general feeling of enthusiasm can still be sensed in Turkish cities.\n\nHowever, in the eyes of [TUR.GetLeader], our new republic has been a democracy just in name ever since its proclamation. The reason for this is rather simple: the lack of an official opponent in the form of an opposition party, since there will always be only one leading party without it - [TUR.GetLeader]'s party. To remedy this issue and to end the de facto one-party rule, the creation of new political parties has been incentivised by our government. On the direct request of [TUR.GetLeader], the new Free Republican Party, consisting mainly of liberals under the leadership of Ahmet Muhtar Paşa, has been established and will from now on participate in Turkish elections. Furthermore, it will serve as the voice of those sceptical of the current government and will thus ensure that all of our citizens will be heard by our current leaders."
 tur.106.a: "The beginning of a true democracy."
 tur.107.t: "Kurdish Independence"
 tur.107.d: "What many deemed to be impossible has now become reality. The Kurds, once believed to be a backwards people with no real hope of ever gaining independence, have managed to hold their own against our forces. By now, they have fortified their positions, and we can no longer hope to achieve a major breakthrough. We have lost our momentum, and have no choice but to concede our defeat.\n\nThis day marks the end of approximately 450 years of Turkish rule over the majority of Kurdistan, and has shown the entirety of the world how far we've truly fallen. With Kurdistan now officially having seceded, we have lost not just our last non-Turkish territories, but also the last remaining bits of prestige we were still holding on to. This has been a hard blow for our politicians and our military, both having failed to suppress the Kurdish revolt in time, but also for our people, whose pride and self-consciousness have taken a major hit. It will take some time for the Turkish identity to recover from this disaster..."

 tur.108.d: "Russia, once again, has declared war on our glorious nation. After the many defeats suffered in the wars of the 19th century, Russia seized its last opportunity to seize the Bosphorus. Turkish and Russian people are by nature enemies. It is time to seal the fate of one of our two empires."
 tur.108.a: "There will be only one victor."
 tur.110.t: "A Friendship Between the Lands"
 tur.110.d: "Today, the Republic of Turkey formally acknowledged the start of cordial and friendly relations with the Chinese Kuomintang government by establishing a Chinese embassy in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The Chinese ambassador Ho Feng-Shan and the son of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Sun Fo, enjoyed a friendly tea with [TUR.GetLeader] and the three men discussed their awareness and understanding of the deep histories of the Chinese people and the Turks.\nAkin to the Kemalist movement, the Kuomintang (KMT) is a revolutionary movement seeking to end imperialism in China while also bringing forth democracy under the guidance of the Chinese Nationalist Party. It is a movement imbued with Sino-nationalism and aims to modernise the Chinese state. The founder of the KMT, Sun Yat-sen’s Three Principles of the People is nearly identical to Kemal’s Six Arrows programme. In essence, the THF and KMT view their parties as young republican movements determined to achieve modernity in nations plagued by imperialism. Furthermore, Mustafa Kemal Pasha himself is admired by Chinese progressive nationalists within the KMT. Nearly 745 articles have been written in China detailing Kemal’s achievements as Prime Minister during the Ottoman era and how Kemal’s political manoeuvrability in the chaos of the collapse of the Ottoman state ushered in stability and modernity after years of decentralised Federalist control. The KMT sees Kemal’s resistance to the West as similar to their ongoing struggle against western and Japanese imperialism. If anything, they see Kemal as Turkey’s Dr. Sun or Dr. Sun as China’s Kemal."
 tur.110.a: "A toast to progress!"
 tur.111.t: "Kadroist Branch Leadership"
 tur.111.d: "The Kadroist branch of the THF is probably best described as a group of intellectuals whose ideology may seem rather contradictionary on first glance, considering that it borrows heavily from both right and left-wing thought from all around Europe. Centred around and inspired by the newspaper Kadro, they've been advocating reforms since the beginning of the thirties, yet during the times of the Ottoman Empire, their demands went unheeded. Believing in a classless society, taking up Marxist ideas and endorsing the thought of a state-controlled economy, many regarded them as too extreme, and they remained relatively uninfluential outside the ranks of the Kemalists. However, now that the Empire has fallen and the Turkish Republic has been proclaimed, the age of reform seems nigh, and the Kadroist movement is slowly gaining some traction.\n\nWith the wind of change blowing in the new Turkish state, some Kadroist politicians seem to believe that it is about time for some change in their leadership as well. Until now, they have been led by Recep Peker, an influential and charismatic figure within the party open to the ideas of the Kadroist magazine. Although Peker's support has thus far resulted in at least some of these ideas being incorporated into the wider Kemalist thought, some feel as though he merely serves as a middle-man, and have now voiced their wish to be led by the true makers of the Kadroist view, the original authors of the magazine. Of these, Yakup Kadri, a famous journalist, has been nominated as the potential new face of the Kadroist political movement, and a vote has been held within the party branch, aimed at determining whether this proposed change would be beneficial to the movement as a whole. Now that the votes have been counted, it seems that the Kadroist politicians have chosen..."
 tur.111.a: "Recep Peker, the Iron Fist!"
 tur.111.b: "Yakup Kadri, the Revolutionary!"
 TUR_ismet_resit_postwar_leader_desc: "Mustafa İsmet Pasha was born in the city of Smyrna on September 24th, 1883, his father being a descendant of the famous Kurdish house Kürümoğulları. In 1897, he moved to Kostantiniyye, where he enrolled in the Imperial School of Military Engineering and, later on, also the Ottoman Military Academy. During his time in the capital, Ismet met Mustafa Kemal, with whom he would later develop a great friendship. He also joined the CUP, however didn't want to partake in the Young Turk Revolution, which wasn't received very well by the other members, forcing him to leave the organisation.\n\nBefore the Weltkrieg, he was stationed in Rumelia and Yemen, where he was able to achieve major successes while negotiating with the natives, resulting in his promotion to the rank of major. He also served in the Balkan Wars, both as an officer on the front and as a military advisor during the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople, which formally ended the Second Balkan War. Throughout the Weltkrieg, the Pasha fought on many different fronts, including Gallipoli, the Caucasus, and Syria, earning himself the rank of colonel.\n\nAfter the war, Ismet embraced his role as the right-hand man of the famous \"Lion of Antep\", which also helped boost his own popularity. During the reign of the OHF, he supported Kemal in pushing through some of his most radical reforms, highlighting his secularistic and centralist notions. Now that Mustafa Kemal Pasha, Ismet's dearest friend, has passed away, he has taken it upon himself to fulfil the wishes of the Gazi and to turn his dreams into reality. Although following in the footsteps of a man such as Kemal will certainly not be an easy task, the party, and thereby the people, trust and respect Ismet and have chosen him to become the first president of the Turkish Republic, putting their future into his hands. It is now up to him to live up to these expectations and to create the modern Turkish state Kemal had envisioned."
 TUR_fevzi_cakmak_postwar_leader_desc: "Mustafa Fevzi Pasha was born on January 12th, 1876, in Kostantiniyye to Artillery Colonel Ali Sırrı and Hesna Hanım. During his youth, he studied in military schools and military high schools and was taught the Persian and Arabic languages by his grandfather. In 1893, he enrolled in the Harbiye Mektibi, the Turkish Military Academy, from which he graduated with the rank of Staff Captain. Afterwards, he served in Serbia and Albania, where he first made contact with members of the CUP. The Balkan War saw Fevzi serving as the Director of the 1st Division in the Western Army, where he was able to achieve some successes, but ultimately had to accept the defeat of the Empire.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, the Pasha achieved his first major victories, the most notable of which being the battle of Gallipoli, during which he commanded the V Corps. Later on, he also served on the Caucasian front and in Palestine. To honour his military achievements, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General in 1918. However, just a month after his promotion, he had to return to Kostantiniyye because of a sudden illness. There, on Christmas Eve, he was appointed Chief of the General Staff of the Ottoman Empire. After the war, Fevzi embraced his role as a war hero and began to climb the ranks of the military ladder once more, with him being appointed Field Marshal at the recommendation of his dear friend Mustafa Kemal only a few years after the war's conclusion. During the post-war period, he stayed mostly in the background and refrained from interfering in the political matters of the state, instead focusing on the repression of partisans.\n\nThe recent political developments, however, have made him change his mind. Seeing the chaotic state the party was in, Fevzi deemed them unfit to rule, and now that he has secured his grasp over the nation, he plans on following his own visions, hoping to bring order and stability, not just to the party, but to the entire nation of Turkey."
 TUR_mehmet_recep_peker_leader_desc: "Mehmet Recep Peker was born on February 5th, 1889, in the grand city of Kostantiniyye, his father having migrated to the Empire's heartland from Dagestan. After completing his primary and secondary education, he enrolled in the Kuleli Military High School and later studied at the Military College, from which he graduated with the rank of a lieutenant in 1907. Having completed his education, Recep did not have to wait long to test his abilities as a soldier and commander. From 1911 to 1913, he fought in Yemen, Tripolitania, and the Balkan Wars. Once the Weltkrieg broke out, he was assigned to the Caucasus front, where he had to face off against the Russians.\n\nAfter the war's conclusion, Recep decided to no longer focus on his military career, choosing to pursue one in politics instead. He joined the OHF and became part of the radical wing of the party, which at the time was considered the political underdog. Like many other members of the radical wing, he grew increasingly attached to the ideas of the Kadro newspaper and began to incorporate them into his own political agenda. Over time, his influence within the radical wing began to grow, leading to him becoming its de facto leader. After Kemal's death and the Moderate takeover of the party, the radical wing, which had by then become the Kadroist wing, slowly started gaining popularity, and as dissent with the new party leadership grew louder, they eventually managed to take over. Now that Peker is in charge, he plans to pursue his radical ideas of a classless society and to bring about a true Turkish revolution."
 TUR_omer_faruk_osmanoglu_leader_desc: "Sultan Ömer I, the only son of former Sultan-Caliph Abdulmecid II and son-in-law of former Sultan Mehmed VI, was born on January 27th, 1898, in Ortaköy Palace. His father used his contacts and power to guarantee young Ömer would get the best education available in the Empire, at the Galatasaray Lycée, Turkey's oldest high school. When he was 11 years old, it was decided that he should attend a European school instead, and, as such, the young prince was sent to the Theresianum Military Academy in Vienna, where he not only learned valuable lessons about military strategies, but also about carpentry, masonry, and other manual skills. After spending a few years in Vienna, he was transferred to the Prussian Military Academy in Potsdam, where he received a more disciplined training.\n\nNot long after he graduated from the academy in 1914, the Weltkrieg broke out. During the first stages of the war, Ömer fought for the Germans, first in Galicia and later on also in Verdun. For his bravery in battle, he was awarded a golden cigarette case, the Red Eagle medal, and the Iron Cross of the First Degree, together with a signed photograph of the Kaiser himself. However, as the Weltkrieg was nearing its end, Ömer was recalled to the Ottoman Empire, for which he fought for the remainder of the conflict.\n\nAfterwards, he remained a relatively important figure in the Ottoman military, chaired the football club Fenerbahçe S.K., and befriended ex-CUP members such as Refet Bele. His relatively peaceful life was disrupted by the outbreak of the Desert War, during which he once again fought in the name of the Empire. Even so, the war did not end well for the Ottoman state - and for Ömer, the incapable government was to blame. With the blessing of his allies in the OSP, he was able to enforce his claim to the throne, and now that he rules over the Empire, he seeks to succeed where the Sultans before him had failed and to bring glory to the downhearted nation."

 tur_osp.28.d: "Usually, news from the palace is met with excitement from the public, as most commoners are always eager to find out more about the lives of the members of the royal family. This time, however, it was met with sorrow and even outrage, as our beloved Sultan and Caliph Ömer I has announced his divorce, officialising the end of his marriage with Sabiha Sultan.\n\nYoung Ömer and Sabiha, the youngest daughter of Mehmed VI, fell in love shortly after the end of the Weltkrieg, and, despite numerous other men requesting her hand in marriage, the young love was allowed to bloom, and their union made official in marriage. Since then, the couple has been blessed with the birth of three daughters, and things were seemingly going well for the lovers. Not all that glitters is gold, however, and behind the facade, the relationship was slowly but surely falling apart, a development which was only aggravated by Ömer's increased intertwinement with the Empire's military - and by now, of course, also political and religious - affairs following the outbreak and loss of the Desert War. Though news of the marriage's deterioration has been trickling down to the public and spreading through the nation's newspaper outlets, few expected it to go as far as it has, and the exact reasons for the divorce have yet to be revealed to the common citizen, with Ömer only giving a very vague explanation in his address.\n\nDespite the right to divorce being enshrined in Islam, it is generally not seen as very laudable, and, as such, Conservatives have been quick to call out Ömer, accusing him of \"staining the pure mantle of the holy Caliphate\" and \"bringing dishonour to Islam itself\". Some have, however, also interpreted Ömer's decision as a sign of modernity and a step forward for the age-old institution that is the Caliphate. For the most part, though, the nation lies in shock, eagerly awaiting what comes next for both their Sultan and Sabiha."

A few weeks back, however, the Sultan came forward to his nation and announced his upcoming wedding with his cousin Mihrişah Sultan, daughter of Yusuf Izzettin Efendi. Though this is rather unusual behaviour for a Sultan, most of our citizen welcomed this news, embraced it as another sign of the Sultan's modernity, and were quickly caught up in the general wave of excitement about the upcoming wedding.\n\nAfter weeks of extensive preparations and planning, today the time had finally come. The ceremony itself was held in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], but kept relatively brief, with Ömer and Mihrişah each saying their vows before the Shaykh al-Islam, whom the Sultan personally asked to lead the ceremony, in the early morning hours after a short sermon. Once the formalities were behind them, the couple led a procession through the city, much to the joy of the common folk, who met the royal family with thunderous applause and countless cheers. The procession ended at the royal palace, where a lavish feast was organised for the Sultan's relatives and some high-ranking party officials, with festivities being expected to last for another few days.\n\nThe leadership of the OSP has furthermore made sure to use this opportunity to the fullest to drum up popular support for the monarchy and the party, and has spent the last few weeks organising festivities in most major cities, which have now put the country in a general state of celebration and joy. Thus, the fortune of our Sultan has extended to the entire nation and has blessed it with a well-deserved distraction from the ongoing crises around the globe."

 tur.112.t: "Merhaba, Mr. Testicle!"
 tur.112.d: "Though objectively a step towards a modern state and society, not all have embraced the recently passed Surname Law as a sign of progress. Indeed, a vocal minority opposed to the reform has grown louder these past few days. Composed mainly of the Traditionalists, who are naturally against any notion put forward by our government, and ethnic minorities such as Armenians and Greeks, who claim that this law is nothing 'but a veiled Turkification attempt' aimed at eradicating their traditions and culture, this group has organised protests against the Surname Law but has thus far failed to gather public support for their cause.\n\nMore peculiar, however, is the choice of some individuals to use the new law as an opportunity for nothing more than a tasteless joke. In what some party officials have described as 'an unacceptable boycott of our legislature', dozens of citizens have elected not to bring honour to their families but to turn themselves into a laughingstock by abusing the rather loose legal boundaries set by the law to change their surname into a grotesque obscenity. The most inapproriate choices, which raised some eyebrows but had to be waved through, included Çıplak (naked), Kaltak (whore), and Tasak (testicle).\n\nThough most of these jokesters probably didn't think too much about it, they've made a decision that will affect not only their own lives but also that of their families for generations to come, and since several figures in the party are unwilling to accept these insults to our culture, it has now been proposed to tighten the law and to retroactively outlaw any surname choices that may be seen as offensive or otherwise obscene."

In the following years, Refet joined the Committee of Union and Progress, served in the Ottoman Gendarmerie, and fought in the Italo-Turkish War and the Balkan Wars. With his competence and skill proven on the field of battle, he quickly began to climb the military ladder, making it to the rank of major by 1913.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, the Paşa commanded part of the Ottoman forces on the Palestinian front, where he managed to hold his line until the Ottoman defences were shattered by Allenby's advance in late 1918. Allegedly, the collapse of the Ottoman frontline also saw Refet get cut off from the retreating forces, forcing him to sneak his way across dozens of kilometres of enemy territory on his own.\n\nWith the end of the Weltkrieg, Refet Paşa had become a famed and greatly decorated military officer. When Kemal claimed chairmanship of the former CUP in 1925, he was among the first to leave the party, since the Gazi's radically secularist notions directly contradicted with Refet's deep-rooted respect for the Sultan and the Caliphate. Staying mostly out of politics thereafter, the Paşa continued his service in the military, and, as such, took part in the defence of the Empire during the Desert War. His efforts proved futile, however, and with the Empire in shambles, Refet felt the need to act. With the support of a number of anti-OHF figures, he launched a coup against the OHF government, and has now established himself as the leader of an interim government, aiming to mend the scars of the weakened Empire."

His parents soon moved back to Manisa, the family's city of origin and seat of power in Western Anatolia, where Yakup would complete his primary education before enrolling at Izmir High School. During his youth, he became known for his inherent love for literature, and would later become especially interested in the works of western writers. Following his father's death, however, he dropped out of high school and returned to Egypt, where he was greatly influenced by the Young Turk Movement, sparking his interest in politics. Just a few months after graduating from a French school in Alexandria, Yakup Kadri once again moved, this time to Kostantiniyye, where he studied law at the Darülfünun-ı Osmani for two years before dropping out to focus solely on his literary career.\n\nThough exploring several types of literature, including dramatic plays and poems, he found his real passion to be novels, which he often times loaded with political messages and social critique. In 1932, he co-founded the Kadro magazine, in which he became more forthright about his political opinions.\n\nAt the time, most politicians rather disliked the radical, almost Marxist ideas propagated by the newspaper, some even calling it an 'insult to Kemalism', but over time, the Kadroist movement gained traction, and, with the Empire's defeat in the Desert War, many came to see Kadri's ideas as a necessity for the survival of a Turkish state. With the majority of the THF having turned away from Kemalism in the traditional sense and having embraced the Kadroist movement, it is now up to Kadri to fulfil his promises and to bring about a true Turkish revolution."

Born in 1868 in Rusçuk, Bulgaria, his family was forced to flee to the Empire's capital in the wake of the Russo-Turkish War. His career in the military started at the Mekteb-i Harbiye-i Şahane, an Ottoman military school, from which he graduated top of his class. During his time there, he also developed a passion for photography and started learning French, before eventually graduating from the Erkân-ı Harbiye Mektebi, the Ottoman Military College, with the rank of staff captain in 1891. He was first deployed in Armenia, where he fought against the fidayi irregulars, and also served in the Italo-Turkish War and the Balkan Wars, though he did not see much action during these conflicts.\n\nThe Paşa would later achieve his first major success during the Weltkrieg, where he was stationed in Medina from 1916 onwards, commanding the defence of the city and the nearby Hejaz Railway against the Arab forces. Despite being cut off and surrounded for months, he refused to surrender the sacred city to the approaching savages and continued to hold the line until reinforcements arrived, earning him the respect and gratitude of the Ottoman people.\n\nThough he mostly refrained from interfering in the Empire's political scene, Fahrettin Paşa never thought much of the Kemalist movement, and his belief in the traditional virtues of Islam naturally led him to disdain Kemal's views. Fearing that the OHF usurpers would exploit the chaos following the Empire's defeat in the Desert War and lead the Ottoman people into their certain doom, he took his chances upon hearing of Kemal's death, rallied his allies, and staged a coup, placing himself at the top of a provisional government.

 tur_osp.30.t: "Election for the National Assembly"
 tur_osp.30.d: "The Sublime Porta, led by the newly crowned Sultan Ömer, together with the government and the former regents, today released a statement calling on each and everyone to vote for the candidates for the National Assembly that will meet in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to adopt the second Ottoman constitution.\nConsidering the current constitution, already over 60 years old, too outdated after the last war, as well as having some sad flaws that paved the way for an age of coups in times of imperial instability, the most enlightened people of the country call upon the people to determine the future of the country itself. Promising to take into account the views of every group and party, from the staunch followers of Islam living by Sharia rules to the representatives of secularists and other religions of the empire. Every voice will be heard, every voice will matter at the Grand National Assembly, which will finally bring peace and harmony to the country!"
 tur_osp.30.a: "We will end the old era, and start a new one!"
 tur_osp.31.t: "Discussions on the Sultan's right"
 tur_osp.31.d: "The Grand Assembly gathered in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today to reform the country's main document and learn lessons from the constitutional era. Sultan Ömer opened the meeting with a brilliant speech, urging all present to be firm and hoping the assembly would make the best efforts for the country's welfare. He himself promised not to oppose any proposal to reduce his sultanic prerogatives, if that was the wish of the people, represented by all the deputies. The speech drew thunderous applause from the vast majority except for a few ardent Kemalist supporters who refused to boycott the assembly elections.\nThe most important issue on the agenda was the relationship between the Sultan and his Grand Vizier. Since the rise of the century, the Sultan had often been the victim of coups, in which rebels used force and the Constitutional right of the sovereign to appoint anyone to be head of the government and made their leader the Grand Vizier, thus giving him absolute power. Such actions made the Sultan a powerless observer and unable to do anything against the government, disliked either by him or by the people of the Empire. Recently there have even been voices in favour of abolishing the Sultanate, mostly among the army, where another rebel could easily appear.\nIn order to prevent such incidents from happening in the future, several suggestions were made. Progressive members of the Assembly propose to remove the Sultan's power of appointing the Vizier and hand it over to parliament, thus moving away from the Germanic model, which had proved flawed in Ottoman reality. Conservative representatives propose instead to make it impossible to abolish the Sultanate in the constitution, which, with proper wording, could be made irreversible, arguing that any plotters wouldn't respect the constitution anyway.\nSultan Ömer has promised to remain impartial, but members of the government are free to speak their minds. Which option would be preferable? "
 tur_osp.31.a: "Choose Progressive plan"
 tur_osp.31.b: "We can't take away the Sultan's rights!"
 tur_osp.32.t: "Adopt of the Second Constitution"
 tur_osp.32.d: "The National Assembly completed its work today by submitting a new constitution to the Sultan for his signature. The resulting draft is much more modern and lacks the disadvantages of its predecessor. It also contains articles on the equality of all before the law, free exercise of religion and the right to inviolability, as well as the abolition of many authoritarian things that are incompatible with today's reality, such as the right of the Sultan to expel anyone from the country without trial. Ömer signed the document without further question and took the oath of allegiance to the new, second constitution. We hope that all this will help bring back to the empire the stability and prosperity it has long desired."
 tur_osp.32.a: "Long live the Ottoman Empire!"
 tur_osp.33.t: "페브지 파샤의 봉기 실패"
 tur_osp.33.d: "Despite the fall of Kemal's government, Fevzi Pasha decided to continue the struggle and go into hiding, although it was clear to all he could only expect to be arrested. In the clique of the OHF's main supporters - the military - he was in third place, after Kemal himself and Ismet - with some daring to challenge the latter's place in favour of Fevzi. So Pasha had few options left - either surrender now and be arrested, or revolt hoping to change the situation in the country.\nThis morning, hours before the decree banning the OHF and arresting its main members was to be signed, Fevzi and a handful of supporters appeared in the barracks of the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] garrison, where Pasha gave a fervent speech calling for an end to the outrages of the new government, even using the deposition of the sultan as an excuse. The garrison, most of whose ranks were connected with the OHF, quickly enough sided with the rebels and marched towards the government residence. This is where Fevzi's first blow awaited, as they found no one but minor officials similarly bewildered by the absence of an interim government. Capturing several of the petitioners as 'prisoners', Pasha hastily started sending messages to other regions of the country, hoping to get support from wherever. But it turned out that communications had been blocked and troops loyal to the OSP were already gathering outside the city, led by the legitimate government.\nBy evening, having realised the hopelessness of the situation and unable to gain support from the people in the capital, Fevzi had surrendered to the provisional government. Most of the OHF supporters had also surrendered, except for the most stubborn, who preferred to go on the run again. The government is no longer under any significant threat, and the country has embarked on its inexorable road to democracy."
 tur_osp.33.a: "Finally we are free from the last threat."
 tur.113.t: "Abolition of the Caliphate"
 tur.113.d: "For over four hundred years, the Ottoman Sultan was also the Caliph of Islam, the supreme religious leader for many Muslims around the world. The sacred artefacts of the Prophet were kept under his protection in our country. All this was until today.\nAfter the final defeat of the Empire in the war against the Arabs, the Sultan and the Caliph was no longer respected by the faithful. After the proclamation of the Republic, Ismet decided to maintain the Caliphate despite Kemal's plans. Today we rectify this injustice to the plans of the great reformer.\nToday we have passed the last laws abolishing the Caliphate in our country forever and depriving the descendants of Osman of this title. The sacred artefacts have been transferred to the main museum in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where they will remain under the protection of the state to prevent any other usurper from appearing."
 tur.113.a: "Long live the Republic, secular and independent!"
 tur.114.t: "Acts of Resistance"
 tur.114.d: "With the Kurdish population growing increasingly unruly, it should not come as much of a surprise that attacks on the local infrastructure in our Kurdish territories have tremendously grown in number over the past few weeks. Roads and railways have been damaged by explosives and rockfall or have been otherwise blockaded, telegraph lines have been cut, and, following a number of ambushes on our patrols, the local gendarmerie now mostly refrains from travelling too far into the Kurdish hinterland. Since much of the local population furthermore refuses to cooperate with our soldiers, many even aiding the rebels through supplies, information, and shelter, and since reinforcements from the capital have a hard time reaching our brave men in Erzurum and beyond, control over the region has been limited severely, as has our ability to counteract the resistance.\n\nOf course, the damage done by the insurgents can be rectified. This, however, will take both time and effort, and the Kurds will do everything in their power to halt these endeavours, especially since the gendarmerie is currently too understaffed to safeguard more than the most important towns and railway hubs in the region."
 tur.114.a: "We have to act!"
 tur.115.t: "A Fateful Night in Halilçavuş"
 tur.115.d: "Halilçavuş, a relatively quiet small village which lies a few dozen kilometres to the southeast of Erzurum, has become the scene of a major tragedy a couple of days ago, when in the midst of the night, its population was shaken awake by the thunderous stampede of nigh fifty horses advancing towards the village. Whilst most citizens were still perplexed and unsure what was happening, the raiders set a number of outlying buildings ablaze and ransacked and plundered others - with no regards for their residents. However, the brave people of Halilçavuş, unwilling to let the onslaught advance further, organised a makeshift defence force and managed to repel the attack, sending the intruders, who were most likely caught off guard by the villagers' courage, back into the mountains from whence they came. Before the gendarmerie got word of the incident and could send a force to aid Halilçavuş in its defence, the fighting was long over, and when the sun rose in the east, two dozen laid dead, even more were wounded, and the village itself was greatly damaged.\n\nThe attack was, without a doubt, the making of Kurdish tribal leaders wanting to show our government their strength, though the gendarmerie has thus far been unable to track down the perpetrators, who are now hiding in the Kurdish hinterland. This is not the first time the Kurds have raided a town or village in the east. However, in the past these attacks were mainly directed against Christians - not Turks. As such, news of this event has been met with public outrage and cries for our government to act, and although [TUR.GetLeader] has already given a speech honouring the heroic villagers of Halilçavuş and has promised that the government shall allocate the funds necessary to rebuild what has been destroyed, much more will have to be done if we wish to prevent this from becoming a reoccurring event."
 tur.115.a: "This will not go without consequences!"
 tur.116.t: "Three Shots in the Morning"
 tur.116.d: "This morning, after one of our leading gendarmerie officers in the Kurdish region had just left the operational headquarters in Erzurum to inspect a new load of arms that had arrived from the capital the day before, he was ambushed by a small group of rebels, who had pretended to be just another bunch of civilians roaming the streets of the city. Before anyone had time to react, they pulled out their weapons, and delivered three fatal bullets to the officer's chest - he laid dead in the blink of an eye. The vile insurgents, who refused to surrender even in the face of overwhelming odds, were killed in the ensuing shoot-out, whilst a number of our soldiers were wounded.\n\nA relatively high-ranking officer murdered in broad daylight - it is only natural that news of this incident reached the capital in no time. The government, angered and frustrated, has already decreed the deployment of additional soldiers in the Kurdish provinces, and has allocated additional funds to the suppression of the rebel forces, citing that 'this cold-blooded atrocity has once again shown the nation that the only language these agitators understand is the use of force'."
 tur.116.a: "Now they've officially carried it too far..."
 tur.117.t: "The Lion of the Desert against the Army"
 tur.117.d: "As time passes, it becomes increasingly clear the public's acceptance of the countercoup is far from welcome. Many officers and ordinary soldiers blame the Liberals for losing the Desert War, believing the current government is no better, especially as it includes the same people. Similarly, many have not accepted the Sultan's abdication, and rumours are circulating among the people that this is how Fahrettin is going to establish an \"eternal regency\" under his own dictatorship.\nWe are also worried about the opposition, now led by Fevzi Pasha. After the countercoup, Ismet Pasha could no longer claim to be the leader of the OHF after Kemal's death, as he discredited himself by allowing Fahrettin to seize power, and the ambitious Fevzi became the leader of the clique. Unfortunately, we failed to catch him immediately; he is now on the run, which makes our position even more difficult, as we have no hope Pasha will sit idly by. So a sooner coup, or at least a failed attempt, seems inevitable, both for the inhabitants of the capital and for the leaders of the provisional government.\nAs long as there is no way for us to change the situation, we can only be prepared for the unavoidable denouement. Considering the fact the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] garrison is not a very loyal to us and there are many open and secret supporters of the OHF and Fevzi, it would be reasonable to call for units from the eastern border to the capital - most of the soldiers there come from the peoples of the empire who were grateful to us for the introduction of religious freedom and decentralisation. Of course, such actions could precipitate Fevzi rebellion, but there is nothing we can do about it - let he who is blessed by Allah win."
 tur.117.a: "Call the troops from the east. Immediately."
 tur.117.b: "Too risky."
 tur.118.t: "페브지 파샤의 봉기 실패"
 tur.118.d: "This morning Fevzi and a group of his supporters appeared at the barracks of the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] garrison, where Pasha gave a fervent speech calling for an end to the outrage by the new government, accusing Fahrettin of installing his own dictatorship through the \"puppet\" OSP. The garrison, most of whose ranks were associated with the OHF, quickly enough sided with the rioters and marched towards the government residence. On the way they were joined by a large crowd. The soldiers guarding the residence were too few to resist, so all the key OSP leaders were captured by Fevzi, except Fahrettin himself, who had managed to flee the town to the newly cantoned units called in from the east near the city.\nBy midday the situation was still difficult - although loyal OSP units had surrounded the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the rebels had no intention of surrendering. Fahrettin was unwilling to storm the city as he feared it would endanger the lives of other members of the government. Suddenly Prince Ömer Faruk Efendi, who had managed to get out of the palace unnoticed, arrived at his headquarters. Many foretold this brave man's future as the new sultan when the provisional government will be ready to summon the rightful ruler to the throne. As he approached Fahrettin, he declared his support for the OSP's policies and even his willingness to personally participate in the storming of the capital. He also showed the Sancak-ı Şerif - or Sacred Banner, a priceless relic from Allah's time, kept in the palace and only brought out during battles. The last time this happened was over 100 years ago during the last rebellion of the Janissary Corps. Although the ancient ceremonial was flagrantly flouted, Ömer proposed the use of the banner - the first time the future Sultan had marched to siege his capital in this way.\nOn hearing of Ömer's joining the Fahrettin, Fevzi's ardour diminished. The assault began under the cover of night, when most of the common supporters of the OHF had dispersed - and ended successfully. The government members were released and the leader of the uprising himself was taken into prison."
 tur.118.a: "Many thanks to Prince Ömer."
 tur.119.t: "Fevzi Pasha Seizes Power"
 tur.119.d: "This morning Fevzi and a group of his supporters appeared at the barracks of the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] garrison, where Pasha gave a fervent speech calling for an end to the outrage by the new government, accusing Fahrettin of installing his own dictatorship through the \"puppet\" OSP. The garrison, most of whose ranks were associated with the OHF, quickly enough sided with the rioters and marched towards the government residence. On the way they were joined by a large crowd. The soldiers guarding the residence were too few to resist, so all the key OSP leaders were captured by Fevzi, except Fahrettin himself, who managed to escape from the city. However, since there were no troops ready to support him, the Defender of Medina realized his situation and surrendered to the authorities.\nUnexpectedly, Fevzi did not declare himself the leader of the country, but reinstated the previous sultan, Ahmed, who had been deposed not more than a month before, to the throne, and became Grand Vizier under him. Naturally, the sultan had no choice but to submit. Not long after the coup had concluded, he gave a speech, which was broadcasted to the whole nation over the radio. In it, he informed the people of the change in politics and assured them that from now on, their voices would be heard, and that under his lead, our nation would return to its former glory."
