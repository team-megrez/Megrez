This important tie to mainland United States has allowed for us to import bureaucrats and labour organisers to Hawaii in order to better achieve socialism. However, these last few months have shown some disunity between the longtime resident organisers and the newer arrivals. The new ministers are less than knowledgeable about agriculture and shipbuilding, and use their wages to import increasingly expensive goods from the mainland.

As one of the many American possessions whose control had been lost during the American Civil War, the reunion of Hawaii with America will undoubtedly bring much needed legitimacy to the owner of the White House, rendering Hawaii as only a political tool and not seen with true equality within the legislature or the administration.\n\nWhile we may respect their decision and refuse a reunion, a notable portion of the Hawaiian population would undoubtedly prefer being under the same umbrella as the whole of America. We could secretly inform the delegates from America and organise a reunion all under [FROM.GetLeader]'s nose before they can react."
 hawaii.118.a: "Defy them!"
 hawaii.118.b: "We must respect their decision."
 hawaii.119.t: "Hawaii Defies Us!"
 hawaii.119.d: "Despite us presenting the possibility of Hawaii being used as a political tool for the victor of the American civil war, our informants have passed on reports that [HAW.GetLeader] has opted to organise their reunion in secret. The reports that have made their way back seem to be solid with little room for interpretation. We can either use all means possible to ensure they remain within our influence, including starting a war with their masters, or simply let the Pacific islands return to continental America."
 hawaii.119.a: "How dare they!"
 hawaii.119.b: "Hawaii isn't worth a war."
 hawaii.120.t: "[FROM.FROM.GetNameDefCap] Threatens Us"
 hawaii.120.d: "A furious telegraph has arrived in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] demanding that Hawaii’s return to continental America be stopped, under threat of war with [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef]. Clearly, they underestimated the sentiment of the Hawaiians, yet wanted to retain whatever little influence they have upon the islands. We can hold our ground and refuse, potentially starting another brutal war after the recent conclusion of the American Civil War, or stand down and let them keep Hawaii."
 hawaii.120.a: "Then war it is."
 hawaii.120.b: "This isn't worth shedding blood over."
 hawaii.121.t: "하와이의 개입 요청"
 hawaii.121.d: "An encrypted message has been sent by [HAW.GetLeader] to us, informing us of the [america.GetName]'s formal demands to see Hawaii returned and reintegrated. Implied in the demands are possibilities that military action will be taken to ensure their return. Thus, [HAW.GetLeader] has requested us to provide military support and back their desire for independence."
 hawaii.121.a: "We protect our allies!"
 hawaii.121.b: "They are on their own."
 hawaii.122.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Intervenes"
 hawaii.122.d: "Honolulu has given us a reply. They declined the reunion offer, but before our delegates could ask them to reconsider lest we use arms to ensure the reunion goes through. At this threat, [HAW.GetLeader] replies that the alliance Hawaii has joined, [HAW.GetFactionName] would support them were they attacked. The delegates were then quickly sent on a flight back to continental America. We are left with two options, going to war for Hawaii, or backing down."
 hawaii.122.a: "Then war it is."
 hawaii.122.b: "Hawaii isn't worth a war."
 hawaii.123.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap]의 개입 거부"
 hawaii.123.d: "We have received a reply from [FROM.GetLeader], who has informed us that they will not back us in the case of an American invasion. We maintain a small military, definitely unable to stand up to the might of American industry. However, we still do have a fighting chance, and we could not surrender or go down without a fight. What shall our next step be?"
 hawaii.123.a: "We have no choice now..."
 hawaii.123.b: "We will not give up our independence!"
 hawaii.124.t: "Hawaii Rejects Reunion"
 hawaii.124.d: "Just now, our delegates in Honolulu have been told that Hawaii will not rejoin America. However, [FROM.GetLeader] has not elaborated on the reasons for declining the reunion and promptly sent our delegates away, showing little room for further negotiations. Needless to say, the only options we are left with are declaring a state of war with [FROM.GetNameDef] or backing down."
 hawaii.124.a: "War it is, then."
 hawaii.124.b: "Hawaii isn't worth a war."

 hawaii.125.d.puppet_same_faction: "Hawaii has established an independent government during the American civil war and entered a defensive alliance to prevent the clouds of war from reaching the shores of the Pacific paradise. Earlier today, we received a message from [FROM.GetNameDef], informing us that they would like to see the peaceful return of Hawaii. Hawaii never belonged to us, and allowing them to return to the control of continental US would protect us from war between us and America, but at the same time, we should honour our alliance. What shall we do?"

 hawaii.126.d: "We have received great news. [FROM.GetNameDef] has informed us that they would not want to jeopardise the precious peace we share currently, and has agreed to allow Hawaii to peacefully rejoin America."
 hawaii.126.a: "Excellent."
 hawaii.127.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap]'s Betrayal"
 hawaii.127.d: "We have received news of an extraordinary betrayal! [FROM.GetNameDef] have refused to promise us of military intervention in case of an invasion. Without the backing of a military force, we are likely to be quickly overwhelmed by the American industry, however, we can also attempt to defend ourselves for as long as possible."
 hawaii.127.a: "This is an outrage!"
 hawaii.127.b: "Hawaii isn't worth fighting over"
 hawaii.128.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap]의 [Root.GetFactionName] 탈퇴"
 hawaii.128.d: "Honolulu, after receiving the news that we would not back them in case of an American invasion, has announced they will leave [Root.GetFactionName] and proudly stand alone against their invaders. This was followed by them denouncing us for cowardly self-preservation and having our diplomats dismissed rudely, despite best efforts to convince them to remain within the [Root.GetFactionName], however, their rage is understandable and we could only honour their decision."
 hawaii.128.a: "That could have gone better..."
 hawaii.129.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses To Return Hawaii"
 hawaii.129.d: "As negotiations reached an impasse, our delegates messaged back to [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] with much disappointment and hesitation, that [FROM.GetNameDef] will not allow Hawaii to rejoin us. Our delegates wanted to convince them otherwise, however they have been dismissed and sent back to continental United States. As such, we have two options remaining, we can declare war to force the return of Hawaii, or we can back down and wait for another time."
 hawaii.129.a: "War it is, then."

 HAW_delos_carleton_emmons_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gJanuary 17th, 1889, in Huntington, West Virginia, United States of America§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gDelos Carleton Emmons graduated from the United States Military Academy in June 1909 as a second lieutenant. He was assigned as the CO of the Company B of the 30th Infantry Regiment, and would follow the 30th until July 1916, where he was promoted to first lieutenant and joined the Signal Corps to become an aviator. He became a Captain by July 1917, a Major in June 1918 and a Colonel in August 1918. He'd transfer to the US Army Air Service in 1920, and in 1921 he completed the Air Service Course at Harvard University. He'd hold several influential posts in the US Army Air Service during the twenties, and would graduate from the Air Corps Tactical School and the Command and General Staff School before 1930. He was assigned to Hawaii in March 1934 as the CO of the 18th Composite Wing and he has held that post until the outbreak of the American Civil War. With the local tensions high, and seeing the writing on the wall, Delos decided to join the revolt against the Federal Government which helped proclaim an independent Hawaii. This has granted him the promotion to Brigadier General, but it is uncertain if he's actually prepared for the job.§!\n\n§YNotes: He is known to have made racist displays against Japanese-Americans in the island, citing the possibility of a Japanese attack on the island."

During one skirmish against the tribesmen, he was wounded in combat, for which he was awarded the Purple heart and the Silver Star. He'd continue to fight with his regiment until October 1905, where he returned to San Francisco. He led the 14th Cavalry during the 1906 earthquake as a part of the government response to the disaster. In October 1906, he rejoined West Point as an Assistant Instructor in Foreign Languages until 1911, where he rejoined the 14th Cavalry for a second tour in the Philippines. He'd return again to the US in 1914, and served as Assistant Professor of English in West Point until 1917, where he was sent to France as an observer for the dying Entente. His observations in France were quite valuable for the US Military Academy, and once the defeat of France became imminent, he was recalled back to the US. He was ascended to Captain in 1920, and after signing up for a third tour in the Philippines, he became a Major. He was later sent to the Republic of Italy as a military attaché during the conflicts that shaped the region and would return as a lieutenant colonel in 1928, where he'd rejoin his beloved 13th Cavalry once more at Fort Riley in Kansas. He'd be rotated as commanding officer throughout many regions of the United States, until he promoted and assigned to Hawaii in early 1936. While he's one of the most experienced members of the staff, his loyalty to Hawaii itself isn't really solid as there seems to have been a struck of luck for Richardson to be spared the chaos that now ravages the mainland when he actually has no connections to the island."

McNarney served with the 21st Infantry Regiment at Vancouver Barracks, Washington, and with the 37th Infantry Regiment at Yuma, Arizona. He became one of the first lieutenants to begin flight training when he signed up to the Signal Corps Aviation School in 1916, from where he'd graduate a year later as a Junior Military Aviator. He was promoted to Captain in May 1917 and posted in New Mexico. He'd later take charge of the flying school at Gerstner Field, in Luisiana. He'd move in late 1920 to Langley Field, where he became a student of the Air Service Field Officers School and remained in Langley as an instructor. He'd graduate with honours from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth in 1926, and he completed the Army War College course in 1930. He succeeded Major Spaatz in the 7th Bomb group after Spaatz promotion. McNarney then became an instructor at the Army War College in Washington, serving from August 1933 to March 1935, where he was redeployed as an attaché to Canada. With the outbreak of the Civil War, McNarney decided that it was best to leave to a place where his particular skills were in short supply, and the Hawaiian staff was more than happy to welcome him from Canada."

His first duty assignments were in the Asiatic Squadron, where he took part in the Philippine campaign and, after 1905, in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1907 to 1909, Lieutenant Richardson commanded the torpedo boats Tingey and Stockton and the Third Division, Atlantic Torpedo Flotilla. He was a member of the first class of the Navy's Post Graduate Engineering School from 1909 to 1911 and served as an engineer on the battleship USS Delaware and on the staff of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. In 1914, Richardson was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Commander and was attached to the Department of the Navy's Bureau of Steam Engineering, where he worked to assure the Navy's fuel supply. In 1917 to 1919, Commander Richardson was navigator and executive officer of the battleship USS Texas. Following a tour at the Naval Academy, he was given command of the gunboat USS Asheville in 1922 and took her out to Asiatic waters, where he also had command of the South China Patrol. Captain Richardson was Assistant to the Chief, Bureau of Ordnance, in 1924 to 1927. In the late 1920s, he commanded a destroyer division and returned to the US for service with the Bureau of Navigation. In January 1931, Captain Richardson placed the new scouting cruiser USS Augusta in commission and commanded her for more than two years. After a tour as a Naval War College student in 1933-1934, he was Budget Officer at the Navy Department, receiving promotion to rear admiral while he was in that position in December 1934. His duties as a flag officer included command of a Scouting Fleet cruiser division, service as aide and Chief of Staff, and a tour as Commander Destroyers, Scouting Fleet. In the end of 1935 he became chief of the Bureau of Navigation.§!\n\n§YNotes: Protested against redeployment of a portion of the Scouting Fleet forward to Pearl Harbor and has bad relations with the U.S. government because of that."
