 SWF_election_success: "Election Success"
 SWF_election_success_desc: "During the Elections of 1937, Spain has seen an unprecedented surge of left-wing voters. The C.N.T. has been put in power, but Spain is still on the hinge of disaster."
 SWF_aftermath_of_civil_war: "Victory in the Civil War"
 SWF_aftermath_of_civil_war_desc: "The Spanish Civil War was a bloody period of Spanish history. Though we have emerged victorious, it will take a long time before the country recovers."
 SWF_consolidating_spain: "Consolidating Spain"
 SWF_consolidating_spain_desc: "Our country has been torn apart by inner conflict, and only time will tell if her new regime will be able to keep it afloat."

 SWF_domestic_focus: "Mending the Rift"
 SWF_domestic_focus_desc: "Now that our troubles have ended, it is time to mend the political rift which remains between the monarchists, the extremists, and our new socialist regime."
 SWF_oppress_opposition: "Crush the Revolution's Enemies"
 SWF_oppress_opposition_desc: "The only way we will ever see permanent peace in Spain is to crush the opposition entirely. They have no place in the new order, and no strength with which to resist us."
 SWF_reconcile_opposition: "Educate the Masses"
 SWF_reconcile_opposition_desc: "A diplomatic approach is what is required: we must find a place for the socialists and monarchists within our new regime, and work with those members most amenable to reach a compromise which will satisfy all."
 SWF_home_rule: "Autonomous Communities of Iberia"
 SWF_home_rule_desc: "Our most important task will be to see each region of Spain given enough autonomy to govern themselves in an efficient fashion, yet to remain subject to the central authority."

 SWF_militia_focus: "Worker's Militias"
 SWF_militia_focus_desc: "Our first order of business is to look to our army - to ensure that it consists of hard workers, those devoted to the new socialist order. Anyone who still holds to the old ways, or who clings too much to faith as more important than their ideology, must be summarily purged from the ranks."
 SWF_radio_focus: "Receptador del Pueblo"
 SWF_radio_focus_desc: "The "Receptador del Pueblo", or "People's Receiver", is a radio receiver produced en masse and distributed among the people freely. This has been the start of a Spanish radio culture."

 SWF_military_focus: "Defending the Revolution"
 SWF_military_focus_desc: "Our new regime sees threats from every corner of Europe and beyond. We must work quickly towards rebuilding and strengthening our revolutionary militias into a full and modern army."
 SWF_standing_army_focus: "A Standing Army"
 SWF_standing_army_focus_desc: "We must focus on our army's strength and quality, instead of focusing on expanding into areas we cannot truly afford."
 SWF_infantry_weapon_focus: "New Weapons for our Army"
 SWF_infantry_weapon_focus_desc: "We must focus on modernising our army's equipment, much of which dates back to the Weltkrieg. This will not do."
 SWF_artillery_focus: "Modernise our Artillery"

 SWF_portugal: "Bringing the Revolution to Portugal"
 SWF_portugal_desc: "Our Iberian Federation will never be complete until we spread the revolution to our brethren in the west."
