 HAI_precarious_governance_desc: "아이티 정부는 사면초가에 놓여 있으며, [Root.GetLeader]의 입지도 위태롭습니다. 반대 세력에 둘러싸인 아이티의 정치 상황이 점점 더 불안정해지고 있으니 가능한 한 빨리 국가를 장악해야 합니다."
 HAI_crippling_illiteracy: "심각한 문맹"
 HAI_crippling_illiteracy_desc: "아이티의 많은 지역이 여전히 문맹으로 남아 있고, 학교에 대한 지원이 턱없이 부족하며, 대부분의 아이들이 어린 나이에 일터로 내몰리고 있다는 사실을 부정할 수는 없습니다. 고등 교육은 일반적으로 프랑스어를 사용하는 아이티인들에게만 제공되며, 크리올어를 사용하는 일반 아이티인들을 위한 자원은 거의 없습니다. 아이티는 이미 다른 나라에 비해 뒤처져 있으며, 문맹 문제가 해결되지 않는다면 아이티는 다른 이웃 국가에 비해 계속 뒤처질 것입니다."

 HAI_black_monday_desc: "검은 월요일로 독일의 경제가 무너지자 우리의 어엿히 자라나던 경제는 심각한 타격을 받았습니다. 점점 더 많은 사람들이 실직하며 빈곤율은 끊임없이 높아지고 있습니다. 검은 월요일의 여파가 대서양을 가로지르고 가뜩이나 어려웠던 우리의 경제를 마비시키는 가운데, 오직 시간만이 아이티의 경제가 이전의 상태로 되돌아갈 수 있을지 말해줄 것입니다."

 HAI_young_democracy_desc: "수 년 만에 처음으로, 마침내 아이티에 민주주의가 돌아오게 되었습니다. 민주주의로의 여정은 쉽지 않을 테고, 우리 정부가 자유, 우애, 평등의 이상을 드러내는데 많은 장애물이 있을 것입니다. 이 길은 우리 나라에 있어 대담하고도 새로운 길이지만, 우리 나라는 분명 카리브해의 자유의 등대로 거듭날 것입니다!"

 HAI_state_economic_reforms_desc: "아이티 정부는 국제 사회의 다른 나라들의 사례에서 영감을 얻어 아이티 경제의 붕괴를 막기 위해 경제에 직접 개입하기로 결정했습니다. 그 어느 때보다 확대된 역할로 정부는 아이티 국민들이 무너진 경제를 지금까지 경험해보지 못할 정도로 더 큰 경제로 재건할 수 있도록 지원할 것입니다. 정부 주도 하의 프로젝트와 건설을 통해 아이티는 카리브해의 다른 국가에 영감을 줄 수 있는 더 강력한 국가로 재건될 것입니다."

 HAI_institutionalized_guarde: "아이티 수비대 확장"
 HAI_institutionalized_guarde_desc: "Haiti will need law and order as subversive elements from abroad and inside plan to destroy our nation in the coming days.

Haitian citizens can sleep well with the Garde's security, knowing that dangerous individuals will have no place in our society."
 HAI_civil_war: "내전!"
 HAI_civil_war_desc: "The events following the election have led to widespread chaos across the island. Many are joining the ranks of Lescot and Calixte as the struggle for the soul of Haiti begins.

 HAI_the_old_constitution: "옛 헌법의 지속"
 HAI_the_old_constitution_desc: "정권의 지속적인 안정을 보장하기 위해, 헌법은 복원되어야 할 것입니다. 우리는 헌법에 근거하여 권력이 무질서한 폭민들의 손이 아니라 올바른 손에 들도록 할 것입니다. 이는 물라토 계급의 부강을 보장하여 가장 적절히 활용할 이들에게 통제권이 돌아가도록 할 것입니다. 그러나 헌법의 부활에도, 우리 나라에 대한 미국과 외세의 계속되는 통제력은 우리 나라의 완전한 독립의 부재를 끊임없이 상기시켜줍니다."
 HAI_expanded_University_haiti: "아이티 주립 대학교 확장"
 HAI_expanded_University_haiti_desc: "The Université d'État d'Haïti is one of Haiti's most premier academic institutions. Dating back to the 1820s, the university's merger of various facilities has led to an expansion of the university. The school of medicine and law will be modernised to incorporate western studies - to ensure a future of bright Haitians.

Thanks to a quirk of the Haitian constitution, however, the end of Calixte's executive authority may not be.

 HAI_german_loan: "독일 채권 확보"
 HAI_german_loan_desc: "미국은 약속된 경제 지원을 하려는 기미 조차 보이지 않고 있으며, 우리가 미국의 금융업자들에게 진 빚을 계속해서 우리 나라를 정치적으로 좌우하는데 이용하고 있습니다. 그것이 가져다 줄 문제에도 불구하고, 우리는 대신 정부의 재정적 안정에 있어 독일에 의지해야합니다."

 HAI_german_investments: "독일 투자 유치"

 HAI_conservative_desc: "엘리 레스코의 보수적인 성향은 언제나 명확했지만, 한때 칼릭스테 대통령에 대한 정치적 반대파 내부에서 보수파들이 지속적으로 우세를 점할지는 확실하지 않았습니다. 그럼에도, 아쩌면 다른 특색을 띄고 있을지도 모르지만, 구질서가 우세를 점했습니다."
 HAI_old_constitution: "엣 헌법 지속"
 HAI_old_constitution_desc: "1932년 헌법은 강력한 정치적 전통에 기초하고 있습니다. 헌법 특유의 표현법이, 특히 국가평의회와 상원의 상당히 모호한 지위가 비판을 받고 있지만, 헌법은 수정되어야지 대체되어서는 안됩니다."
 HAI_reconvene_senate: "상원 재소집"
 HAI_reconvene_senate_desc: "다르티게나브 대통령 시절, 상원은 1년을 기한으로 수십년동안 아이티 법에 명시된 임시 기구로 대체되었습니다. 그러나 다르티게나브의 법령은 그 뒤 계속 연장되었습니다. 그 기나긴 세월의 끝에, 마침내 상원을 복원할 때가 도래하였습니다."

 HAI_define_executive_desc: "일부 행정부의 권한에 대한 헌법의 모호한 정의는 칼릭스테가 나라를 벼랑 끝까지 몰아넣을 수 있도록 하였습니다. 우리는 의회 양원과 협력하여 각 기관의 자리를 명확하게 정의하고 선출직 공무원의 임명직 겸임을 제한하는 일련의 수정안을 작성해야 합니다."

 HAI_question_of_guarde: "아이티 수비대에 대한 의문"
 HAI_question_of_guarde_desc: "The army has long been a source of national pride, Haiti was born from righteous struggle after all. It has also, however, long been a thorn in the side of civilian administrations. Indeed, we are only able to reverse the damage done by the Garde under Calixte's leadership. Going forward, we must ensure that the Garde is entirely under civilian supervision and reduce its societal standing."
 HAI_liberal: "자유주의적 아이티"
 HAI_liberal_desc: "여타 보르노 시절의 잔재들과 보다 보수적인 민족주의자들과의 불협화음으로 인해, 레스코 대통령은 그의 정치적 우위를 공고히 하며 자유주의적 민족주의자들을 정치적 흥기로 이끌었습니다."
 HAI_attract_business: "대기업 유치"
 HAI_attract_business_desc: "대기업들은 그들의 우위를 굳건히 하고 전세계에 더욱 더 자회사의 손길을 뻗었습니다. 그들이 본래 '아이티의' 기업이 아닐지라도, 우리는 세계 최대의 기업들이 아이티로 진출하도록 적극적으로 구애해야 합니다. 우리 스스로를 그들의 확고한 동맹의 위치로 자리매김함으로써, 우린 분명 이익을 얻을 수 있을 것입니다."

 HAI_cash_mining: "귀금속 광산 확대"
 HAI_cash_mining_desc: "The mineral wealth of our nation remains almost entirely unsurveyed. To stimulate the development of the mining sector, landowners should be granted complete legal control over subterranean resources and provided with financial incentives to survey the resources beneath their plots."
 HAI_building_infrastructure: "기반 시설 건설"
 HAI_building_infrastructure_desc: "Beyond the cities, for the transportation of goods and personnel, businesses must rely on a series of locally maintained dirt paths alone, often making use of pack animals. Let us take up the torch of infrastructural development again, expanding Borno's rail network into the most isolated parts of the country."
 HAI_housing_projects: "새로운 주택 공급 계획"
 HAI_housing_projects_desc: "Informal settlements dominate the cities. New architectural developments, luckily, may at last allow us to address this issue. The state should construct standardised high-density apartment buildings over such settlements and lease units back to former squatters."
 HAI_agrarian_economy: "농업경제"
 HAI_agrarian_economy_desc: "농업 중심 경제 구조를 해치지 않으며 국가 발전을 촉진하는 방법을 가늠하려면 신중하게 접근할 필요가 있습니다. 이것의 달성법에 대하여 우리 정부에 조언해줄 새 사업가 위원회가 창설되어야 합니다."
 HAI_modernize_farming: "농업 방식 현대화"

 HAI_begin_electrification: "전력화 개시"
 HAI_begin_electrification_desc: "Haiti has lagged decades behind much of the rest of the world in bringing electricity to the masses. Outside of the wealthier parts of Port-Au-Prince, electricity is the exclusive domain of the state. We must at last address this issue."
 HAI_begin_tourism: "관광업 개시"

 HAI_subsidize_farmers: "농민 보조금"
 HAI_subsidize_farmers_desc: "부국들은 농업 보조금을 늘림으로써 주변 시장에 농산물이 넘쳐흐르게 만들고 있습니다. 우리가 그정도로 우리 농부들에게 보조금을 넉넉히 줄 형편은 아니지만, 농업 비용을 특정 수준까지 부담해주는건 가능합니다."
 HAI_expand_lumber: "제재업 확대"
 HAI_expand_lumber_desc: "Under the American occupation, lumber exports grew substantially. New forestry methods enabling the creation of vast tree plantations, however, were never put into practice. A bit of state capital is just what the lumber industry needs to transform itself into a lucrative beacon of modernity."
 HAI_rural_housing: "시골 주택 공급 계획"
 HAI_rural_housing_desc: "Many in the countryside live in squalor, jeopardising their work productivity. With state support for new housing developments in the countryside, agricultural production will surely grow greatly."
 HAI_revitalized_economy: "경제 활성화"
 HAI_revitalized_economy_desc: "The economic depression which began in 1925 and reached new lows in 1936 is at an end. Our coffers overflow with the fruits of economic prosperity. We can put this money to use, expanding, rather than cutting back on, our most successful economic initiatives."
 HAI_new_constitution: "신헌법"
 HAI_new_constitution_desc: "The constitution of 1932, though steeped in tradition, represents all that is wrong with Haitian democracy and shows just how far Haiti has strayed from the ideals of its founders. An entirely new document must be drawn up mandating a more thoroughly democratic political system and reducing the power of the executive."
 HAI_parliamentary: "의원내각제"
 HAI_parliamentary_desc: "In order to preclude abuse of power, the office of the presidency should be made mostly ceremonial while most executive power is transferred to the Speaker of the National Assembly. The transition, of course, shall be gradual, with President Lescot given time to campaign for the Assembly and the role of Speaker."
 HAI_presidential: "대통령제 공화국"
 HAI_presidential_desc: "The executive has proven effective in addressing national emergencies. In order to preclude abuse of the office, the President and his cabinet should be made accountable before the legislature short of impeachment and the speaker of the National Assembly invested with limited executive authority."
 HAI_dissolve_guarde: "아이티 수비대 해체"
 HAI_dissolve_guarde_desc: "The army has threatened administration after administration. While a strong border force must be maintained, the army itself, the Garde, simply must be dissolved. Let us strike the iron while it's hot and eliminate the army while it is weak."
 HAI_democratic_legislature: "민주적 입법부"
 HAI_democratic_legislature_desc: "While Haiti was perhaps the first nation to formally establish universal suffrage, the realities of Haitian democracy has seen access to the ballot box severely restricted. With structural concerns sorted, we should invest in new electoral oversight mechanisms to ensure that every Haitian is aware of and able to exercise their right to vote."
 HAI_liberal_republic: "권력 이양"
 HAI_liberal_republic_desc: "To ensure that the nation is never again dominated by a core of urban elites, we must lessen the distance between the halls of power and the common people. To accomplish this, municipalities and departments should be given greater administrative responsibilities and empowered to form their own directly elected governing councils."

 HAI_mobilize_guard: "수비대 동원"

 HAI_seize_american_weapons: "미국 무기 습득"
 HAI_seize_american_weapons_desc: "Though it beat a hasty retreat from Haiti in the face of its own internal issues, the United States remains hostile to our government. We should take control of any remaining American materiel despite its inevitable objections."
 HAI_aftermath_of_collapse: "붕괴의 여파"
 HAI_aftermath_of_collapse_desc: "The return of American forces to the continental United States has left not only equipment but also physical infrastructure behind in Haiti. We should catalogue and make use of disused American facilities."

 HAI_democracy_desc: "아이티와 같은 계층 국가에서, 기본적인 토대 법안은 역사적으로 비대표된 사람들이 정치적 절차에 접근할 수 있게끔 하기 위해 힘써야 합니다. 새 헌법을 밑바닥부터 써내려가도록 합시다."
 HAI_peoples_assembly: "인민의 의회"
 HAI_peoples_assembly_desc: "The structure of the national assembly has historically favoured the political centre of Haiti - Port-Au-Prince, particularly its most famously wealthy burrows.

With preparations made, let us immediately hold elections for the new body."

 HAI_infrastructure_expansion_desc: "As part of our state work programmes, we will take steps to build infrastructure in Haiti - most of our network consists of poorly paved roads, and in some areas roads are simply non-existent. The political turmoil of the last years has also degraded what little we had, making it difficult for our people to use them as our nation's economy rises again. We will undertake an modernisation programme to build up Haiti's infrastructure while also providing jobs for Haitians."

Ever since their unlawful occupation of the islands, Haiti has been exploited repeatedly by our giant of a neighbour. As a result, the operations of American companies in Haiti and any assets must be taken over by the state to better serve the Haitian people.

 hai.2.d: "재앙입니다! 독일 경제의 붕괴 이후 독일 기업과 미국 금융 기관이 아이티에 충격파를 가했습니다. 이미 온 나라에 실업이 만연한 상황에서, 이번 위기는 이 문제를 더욱 악화시킬 수밖에 없습니다. 지난 수 년 동안 칼릭스테 대통령이 추진해온 모든 개혁이 물거품으로 변해버렸습니다."
 hai.2.a: "맙소사!"
 hai.3.t: "Lescot Denounces Presidential Overreach"
 hai.3.d: "As President Calixte leaned hard on members of the Council of State and the National Assembly, the leader of the main opposition Elie Lescot denounced President Calixte in a speech to the National Assembly. While it may strengthen the resolve of opposition Deputies, Lescot has never liked Calixte and his speech will change few minds."
 hai.3.a: "He doesn't matter."
 hai.4.t: "Centrist Councillor Speaks out"
 hai.4.d: "In a harsh critique of President Calixte's electoral campaign, a centrist councillor has denounced Calixte as being undemocratic and borderline dictatorial. He claims that the practices made by the Calixte regime will bring an end to Haiti's democracy."
 hai.4.a: "Silence him."
 hai.4.b: "Let him go."
 hai.5.t: "카세우스의 제안"
 hai.5.d: "선거가 치열해지며, 압승에 대한 그 어떠한 기대도 내려놓을 수밖에 없게 되었습니다. 선거는 치열한 경합에 박빙의 승부가 될 확률이 높습니다. 우린 어쩌면 선거에서 승리를 거둘 가능성을 높이기 위하여 고인의 명의로 투표하는 등 \"다른 방법\"을 사용할지 고려해 볼 수  있을 것입니다. 칼릭스테가 우리의 사랑하는 조국을 위하여 좋은 의도만을 품고 있기에, 이는 오로지 아이티의 안정을 위함일 뿐입니다."
 hai.5.a: "이 조치는 아이티의 민주주의와 질서의 수호를 위하여 꼭 필요하다."
 hai.5.b: "그래, 이렇게 민주주의는... 우레와 같은 박수 소리 속에서 죽는구나."
 hai.6.t: "Scandal on Campaign"
 hai.6.d: "Somehow while on the campaign trail, it was revealed that several members of the Garde d' Haiti had taken bribes from the Dominican Republic. Some claim that the bribes go as high as President Calixte himself. While the Garde's loyalty to Haiti is beyond doubt, this may be difficult to overcome politically."
 hai.6.a: "Acknowledge that it is an issue that must be investigated."
 hai.6.b: "Deny these crimes!"
 hai.7.t: "Assemblyman Announces Support for Calixte"
 hai.7.d: "It would appear that our efforts have bore fruit. Thanks to Calixte's charisma on the election trail and some \"motivations,\" a number of assemblymen from the various departments have declared their support for Calixte."
 hai.7.a: "One step closer to victory!"
 hai.8.t: "Price-Mars Remains Sceptical"
 hai.8.d: "The prominent doctor and politician Jean Price-Mars has spoken about his doubts toward President Calixte's regime. While Price-Mars has agreed with the President's left-leaning views, he has repeatedly denounced the President's authoritarian tendencies."
 hai.8.a: "Sit down with him privately."
 hai.8.b: "Call him out in the press!"
 hai.9.t: "Jean Price-Mars Endorses Calixte"
 hai.9.d: "It appears that Calixte's arguments and discourse have swung Price-Mars' favour. With the progressive cause behind us, we shall be victorious!"
 hai.9.a: "Excellent!"
 hai.10.t: "Jean Price-Mars Rebukes Calixte"
 hai.10.d: "Price-Mars has denounced Calixte as a despot, claiming that Calixte's tactics and policies will only spell for democracy in Haiti. Given the doctor's popularity among the educated and his own support base, this is a serious setback for the Calixte movement."
 hai.10.a: "What a fool."
 hai.11.t: "Calixte Sworn In as Minister of Justice"
 hai.11.d: "With it clear that President Calixte will not win reelection in the National Assembly, his advisors have devised a scheme through which he will stall ratification and continue to govern as de facto president through the cabinet. As the Haitian constitution is not clear what happens if no president is selected by June 10, it is widely accepted that the former president's cabinet would continue to rule the nation. With President Calixte now also a member of his own cabinet, he can continue to govern even after his term has expired."
 hai.11.a: "Whoever thought of that is a genius!"
 hai.12.t: "National Assembly Protests"
 hai.12.d: "Declaring our campaign as one that is fraudulent and full of corruption, members of the National Assembly have protested against us. They have pledged to do everything in their power to block Calixte from gaining the presidency. Our hold throughout the nation is quite secure, and these fools will soon learn that they will be on the wrong side of Haitian history."
 hai.12.a: "Who cares?"
 hai.13.t: "Councillors Caught Colluding with Lescot"
 hai.13.d: "We have received news that some of the councillors are outright colluding with Elie Lescot. While we do have a fair amount of support on our side, this gives Lescot's side an advantage. While we can just let them be, to solidify our chances of victory we can ask the Garde to persuade them otherwise."
 hai.13.a: "Arrest them, and issue pardons for their votes."
 hai.13.b: "Let them go."
 hai.14.t: "A New Commander of the Garde d'Haiti"
 hai.14.d: "The time has come to appoint a new commander for the illustrious and elite Garde d'Haiti. The institutionalists in the National Assembly support Alfred Auguste Nemours, while many in President Calixte's inner circle support Paul Magloire, a young officer loyal to Calixte personally and politically."
 hai.14.a: "Choose Nemours."
 hai.14.b: "Magloire has always been loyal."
 hai.15.t: "The American Collapse"
 hai.15.d: "The unthinkable has happened. For years, while the United States was plagued with economic disorder and instability, its constant presence in the Caribbean made Haiti a virtual puppet. For years, the Haitian people suffered - the United States Marines brought nothing but misery to our nation. The US-backed projects did nothing but bring the corvee system to Haiti, making Haiti into a slave state yet again. No more. The colossus of the New World has broken out into an all-out civil war and has fallen on her knees. There is no doubt they will be unable to rule over us like the imperialists they are. Once again, Haiti's chains are broken."
 hai.15.a: "My God."
 hai.16.t: "The Aftermath of the Monte Cristi Affair"
 hai.16.d: "After the Dominican Army slaughtered thousands of Haitian citizens in the border town of Monte Cristi tensions have risen massively between the Dominicans and our government."
 hai.16.a: "We must be ready."
 hai.17.t: "Reports of Bribery"
 hai.17.d: "While [HAI.GetLeader] has tried hard to crack down on Dominican excursions over the border, his efforts continue to be remanded by his field commanders. A junior officer has reported that the Dominicans have bribed these commanders to stay quiet and refuse to crack down on the Dominican soldiers."
 hai.17.a: "We must crack down on the Dominicans!"
 hai.17.b: "We cannot afford to catch these traitors."
 hai.18.t: "Haiti Arrests Officials"
 hai.18.d: "Reports from our border agents indicated that the officers we bribed have been arrested. While this has not helped them solve the underlying problem of corruption in their ranks."
 hai.18.a: "We must continue to undermine them."
 hai.19.t: "Haitian Officers Successfully Bribed"
 hai.19.d: "Our spies across the border and informants in our own army units reported that in the last few weeks Dominican officials have issued another round of bribes to our officers in the field. Coinciding with reports from the same units that there has been no activity from the Dominican side of the border, we can assume that these officers are not to be trusted."
 hai.19.a: "Tensions build..."

 hai.22.d: "With the breakout of war in America, The small Caribbean nation of Haiti has suddenly found itself free and independent, but alone in the world. As tensions across the globe heat up, the Haitian government has not been blind to the dangers of their new position, and after building a series of new economic ties with our economic sphere, have now petitioned us for membership in the [Root.GetFactionName].\n\nOur foreign office has discussed this proposal at length - while Haiti isn't exactly known as a powerhouse on the world stage, their strategic position in the centre of the Caribbean Sea would help us conduct operations across the whole region, which includes some sizeable mineral reserves and the ever-important Panama Canal. Furthermore, some more optimistic minds believe that Haiti may be able to sustain some rubber plantations, if given some capital to develop them. Perhaps we should take Port-au-Prince up on their offer?"
 hai.22.d.GER: "The American Civil War has proven to be a significant blow to the Monroe Doctrine, and the smaller nations of the Americas have now found themselves without protection in the power vacuum. The island nation of Haiti has approached us, as one of the few regional powers in the Americas with naval reach, to petition to join our alliance. Although they cannot provide much in the way of arms or men, given the circumstances it may be worth expanding our reach in the Caribbean to bolster our exist hold in the area. A closer look at the current situation might be worth investigating as the Foreign ministry weighs its options."

 hai.30.d: "Unfortunately, [?FROM.faction_leader.GetNameDef] has come to disagree with our conclusion that our young rubber plantations need new investments. According to them, capital is in high demand and in short supply at the moment, and the investments already given should be more than enough to develop perfectly reasonable rubber cultivation. We'll just need to manage with what we have."

 hai.52.d: "Following the government's collapse to Dominican demands, both the army and National Assembly are up in arms over the failure of [HAI.GetLeader] to hold them accountable. In order to prevent complete collapse, General Franck Lavaud and a clique of army officers have seized control of the government and arrested [HAI.GetLeader].

 hai.52.a: "We cannot afford to look weak."
 hai.53.t: "Radicalisation Increases"

 hai_les.1.d: "In the constitution written in the late 1910s by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave, the document outlined a Senate which would serve as an upper house to the National Assembly. However, the Americans preferred to use the Council of State, a much smaller body and one they could more easily control. They insisted that upon withdrawal, they would reinstate the Senate. However, when former President Borno was elected in 1932, he refused to reinstate the Senate, and instead also preferred to deal with the Council of State.\n\nWe now have the option of continuing to use the Council of State, or resurrect the Senate."

Many also claim that it is an outlet for black social mobility and without it, they would turn to revolution. At least while as a member of the Garde they can be watched and controlled. As a result, many claim that we should keep the Garde as is so as not to upset its leadership structure."

However, he remains secure through his brutal network of police chiefs, known as section chiefs which alert the Minister of the Interior Georges Léger to any rumblings of rebellion within army garrisons, through maroons in the wilderness, or any general discontent on large farms. Léger has reported to us that there is some chatter in the army over whether Lescot is truly the man for the coming war against the Dominicans, or whether former President Calixte's lieutenant Paul Magloire would be more suited for the job. While this may sound dangerous, these are low-level officials, and Léger has made it clear that there is no wider discussion of a coup plot."

 HAI_demosthenes_calixte_leader_desc: "Colonel Démosthènes Pétrus Calixte is a black, United States-trained, Haitian commander, and the President of Haiti since 1933. Calixte and his clique took power in a context of Dominican provocations on the border, that then-President Louis Borno was not able to deal with by allowing military buildup. The departure of the last brigade of American marines allowed Demosthènes Calixte, in his role of Commander of the Garde d'Haiti, to depose the President and take power. However, despite his reformist views, Calixte was forced to oblige American demands, represented in Haiti by High-Commissioner Russell. Calixte has promised to respect the imposed financial constraints and some of the limits in trade and foreign policy. While some of his planned reforms, such as the desired army buildup plan, or the cessation of the much-hated civil conscription were able to go through, most of his other promises were stopped in Parliament. The sweeping constitutional reforms that aimed to elect the President by popular suffrage or to abolish the Council of State were constantly blocked, mostly because of the decisive influence of American money and political pressure.\n\nCalixte thus rules in an authoritarian manner, using decrees and leveraging his powerful position as both President and the Commander of the Garde to stay in place. But now, President Calixte is between a rock and a hard place. He hasn't abandoned his dreams of reforming Haiti into a democratic state free of foreign influence, but he first has to deal with the continued influence of the Americans, the corruption of many officials, and the doubtful fidelity of the political factions that aligned with him. As Calixte loses more and more control, rumours of a palace coup grow noisier. But the authority of the Commander is still strong and no person can say what his future might look like."
 HAI_jean_price_mars_leader_desc: "A Haitian doctor, teacher, politician, diplomat, writer, and ethnographer, Jean Price-Mars served as secretary of the Haitian legation in Washington D.C. and as chargé d'affaires in Paris during the Weltkrieg. Taking his surname from his mulatto father and the mulatto writer Hannibal Price, Price heard stories of Haitian folklore from the earliest days of youth - giving him the respect of Haitian traditions. Price-Mars is a champion of Négritude, the belief in a shared \"black\" consciousness among the African diaspora, and a prominent advocate of voodoo as a complete religion.\n\nHis political ideology stems heavily from the resistance of Haitian peasants towards the American occupation, and he heavily despises the Haitian elite for their seeming ineptitude to provide for the masses. Inspired by the novel \"Madame Bovary,\" Price-Mars coined the term \"collective bovarysme\" to criticise Haitian elites of mixed white ancestry whom Price-Mars blames for holding unfair economic and economic positions in the country. A critic of Haiti's crippling illiteracy, Price-Mars believes that universal education will lead to an advancement of society. Fully embracing Haiti's history of slavery, Price-Mars believes the Haitian slaves were the true source of Haiti's traditions and history. He admired the slaves' culture and religion as a base of resistance towards the European colonisers - the foundation of a Haitian nation that he seeks to emulate. "
 HAI_elie_lescot_leader_desc: "President Elie Lescot was originally a pharmacist in Port-de-Paix, in the north of the country. A representative of the interests of the mulatto elite, he entered politics before the Weltkrieg and then took on several posts in the governments of Louis Borno and Demosthènes Calixte. He however never relinquished his independence, and made alliances only out of pure interest. Comforted by his favourable standing among the Americans and the Germans, Lescot was able to take power following the fall of President Calixte. Lescot now plans to bring liberal and democratic reforms to Haiti, and to dismantle the socialist-inspired policies of Calixte. The issue of constitutional reform is one that is still to be answered for the new government. As Lescot's attachment to democracy is debatable, it is unsure how much say the President plans to give to democratic institutions."
 HAI_stenio_vincent_leader_desc: "Sténio Vincent is an old character of Haitian politics. Already active before the Weltkrieg, he was briefly the mayor of Port-au-Prince from 1907 to 1909, and was a member of Dartiguenave's government from 1916 to 1917. A member of the Conservative Party, he first supported the American occupation before radically turning against it in the 1920s. From then on, Vincent was constantly a leading figure of the opposition as the head of the Nationalistes, opposing both Louis Borno and Démosthènes Calixte for their collaboration with the American occupiers. The victory of President Vincent in the 1940 elections came as a surprise to many of the elite, but well-informed observers have known for long his popularity among the popular strata of the capital. His platform, revolving mostly around the end of American occupation and national independence, appeals to the Haitian masses who hope to one day see their country free of foreign influence."
 HAI_john_russell_leader_desc: "General John Russell's long tenure as American Marine Commissioner for Haiti suffered only a minor hiccup with the withdrawal of American Marines from the country, with him still keeping a close eye on the affairs of Haiti's civilian government. While sympathetic to the Haitian people and holding surprisingly tolerant racial views, Russell is loyal only to the United States."
 HAI_franck_lavaud_leader_desc: "Born in the west of Haiti, Franck Lavaud graduated among the top of the Military Academy and rose rapidly through the ranks of the Haitian army. Reaching the post of Chief of Staff of the Garde under Elie Lescot's presidency, he was then appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Haitian army. The commander always stayed far from politics, and is dedicated above everything else to the good of his country. This is what motivated him to move against President Lescot after his failure dealing with the Dominican Republic. The weakness of the president would have led to the weakness of Haiti, which Lavaud can't accept. \n\nLavaud announced already that he doesn't mean to rule for long, as he is not a politician. His main goal is to organise elections and ensure the peaceful continuity of the Haitian state. \n\nIn much the same way and despite his apolitical position, Lavaud grew to despise the factionalism riddling Haitian politics and regularly leading the country to international humiliation. The general, supported by the armed forces and a large part of the population, thus intends to suspend political life until the stability and strength of Haiti can be restored."

 HAI_country_intro_header: "Haitian Independence Day"
 HAI_country_intro_content: "President Calixte and the elite of the Garde d'Haiti paraded through Port-au-Prince to celebrate Haitian Independence Day, a day which seems ironic to many considering Haiti's political situation. Haiti was occupied by the United States starting in 1919, and while the occupation officially ended in 1933, American restrictions are still severe.\n\nFollowing President Calixte's coup of former President Louis Borno in 1933, the Haitian-American relationship has become even more strained. With the establishment puppet Borno no longer around to do the bidding of American banks, they have struggled to get President Calixte to follow the agreements made by previous Haitian governments regarding Haiti's finances. As with anything in Haiti, race plays a major role. Calixte is loved by the poorer black population, including its most proud institution, the army. The mixed-race political elite detests Calixte and wishes to regain control of the political apparatus.\n\nWith the Haitian general elections on the horizon in April, Calixte will struggle to secure the support of the National Assembly to earn re-election, and struggle harder to secure support in the Council of State for ratification. Calixte has been presented with 3 options by his cabinet and clique of advisors. First, attempt to use proscribed methods to gain the support of Deputies and Councillors. Second, run a popular campaign and give up the title of Commander of the Garde d'Haiti as a gesture of good faith. Third, the most radical option, is to do anything within his power to prevent the ratification of a Lescot victory and appoint himself to his own cabinet, thereby continuing to rule by de facto authority even after his term has elapsed.\n\nOpposition leader Elie Lescot, who is supported by a broad coalition including the nationalist Sténio Vincent and liberal Jean Price-Mars, has made it clear that if Calixte loses legitimately and refuses to hand over power, he will resort to violence to protect democracy in Haiti."
