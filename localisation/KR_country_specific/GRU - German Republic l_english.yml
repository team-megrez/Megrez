### Renaming Events ###

 gru.1.t: "Democratising our administration"
 gru.1.desc: "In order to break with the old reactionary regime we must get rid of their influence in every corner of our new nation. The administration needs to be democratised, the teachers re-educated and the army restructured. A part of this process is to remove the honours they have awarded to jingoist slaughterers like Otto von Bismarck and Paul von Hindenburg, with the greatest examples being the countless Bismarck memorial towers all over our nation as well as the city of Hindenburg. Our president has come forward with the suggestion to name it in honour of Karl Marx, while the locals preferred to keep the preposterous name."
 gru.1.a: "Rename it in honour of Karl Marx"
 gru.1.b: "A name to represent its industrial background"

 gru.2.t: "Restoring the old order"
 gru.2.desc: "After defeating our socialist foes it is time to restore order on the local level as well. Their regime changed the names of the places, streets and boulevards named after heroes of our nation, because they were deemed unrepresentative or counter-revolutionary. Their original names shall be restored."
 gru.2.a: "It shall be Hindenburg forever"
