 CSA_revolutionary_education: "혁명교육"
 CSA_revolutionary_education_desc: "구 미국의 교육은 수많은 혁명가들을 양성했지만, 본질적으로 그 교육 체제는 계속 반동적이었습니다. 미국 역사 내내, 교육은 순종적인 노동자와 악한 자본가, 그리고 더욱 양심 없는 정치인을 양성하도록 만들어졌고 개량되어 왔습니다. 그것을 끝낼 시간입니다!"
 CSA_reconstruction: "재건 시작"
 CSA_reconstruction_desc: "제2차 미국 내전은 우리 국가의 많은 부분을 파괴했습니다. 미국의 수많은 도처에 진흙과 뼈만이 뒹굴고 있으며, 수많은 도시들은 지금 연기나는 잿더미에 불과합니다. 따라서 우리는 새로운 주택과 기반 시설들을 가능한 한 많이 건설하도록 노력해야 할 것입니다."

 CSA_reconstruction_is_over_desc: "선동과 선전은 해외의 전쟁에 참여하기 반대하는 수백만의 미국인들의 마음을 움직이지 못했습니다. 내전에서 싸우기를 거부했던 몰몬교도, 메노파 신도, 여호와의 증인, 후터파 신도들은 이제 재건을 돕기 위해 임업 분야에서 일할 수 있게 되었습니다."
 CSA_a_new_america: "미국의 영웅들을 돌아보고 기억하라"
 CSA_a_new_america_desc: "조 힐과 헤이마켓 사건의 순교자들, 그리고 유진 뎁스의 이름은 오늘날에도 널리 알려져 있습니다. 하지만 그들은 오래도록 투쟁해온 미국 생디칼리스트 영웅들 중 극히 일부일 뿐입니다. We must undo years of misinformation about these figures through a concentrated propaganda effort, and also begin to teach a new generation about the legacy of the countless brave American heroes who fought for workers' rights."
 CSA_second_convention: "제2차 제헌회의"
 CSA_second_convention_desc: "우리의 혁명 투쟁의 다음 단계를 거머쥘 때가 왔습니다. 단 하나의 대의와 이념 아래 노동자들을 통합할 방법을 찾기 위해서 말입니다. 우리의 대표들이 다수의 노동조합과 공동체에서 왔지만, 우리는 사회주의 정부의 미래에서는 통합되기를 소망합니다. 한 세기 전에 그랬듯이, 우리는 필라델피아에서 제헌회의를 열 것입니다!"
 CSA_american_commonwealth: "아메리카 연방"
 CSA_american_commonwealth_desc: "독재체제로 후퇴할 수는 없습니다! 제2차 제헌회의에서의 우리의 헌신적인 지원으로 마침내 노조기반 사회주의를 보여 줄 것입니다. 벨라미의 국민주의를 계승했지만, 우리 국가의 노동자와 노역자에게 사회인 그리고 경제적인 자유를 제공할 것입니다!"
 CSA_protect_the_working_class: "노동자 계급을 보호하라!"
 CSA_protect_the_working_class_desc: "많은 더 나은 경제적 체제에 대한 새로운 생각과 이론이 미국에서 존재했지만, 내전의 혼란은 이러한 아이디어를 실현하는 것을 어렵게 했습니다. 그리고 지금 우리는 충분한 시간과 기회를 가졌음으로 헌법에 써진 노동자 권리 보호를 실현하여, 진정으로 일하는 사람들의 민주주의를 만들 수 있을 것입니다."
 CSA_empower_councils: "마을민주주의"
 CSA_empower_councils_desc: "새로운 연방은 권위주의적 방법을 통해 건설되어서는 안 됩니다. 우리는 더 나은 계급적 특성으로 우리의 민주적인 방식으로 건설되어야 합니다. 법을 통해서 풀뿌리 민주주의와 시의회 참여에 힘을 줄 것입니다. Political decisions will no longer be a distant murmur on Capitol Hill; instead, they'll be made right amongst the workers!"
 CSA_mutal_economic_comitee: "직종노조위원회"
 CSA_mutal_economic_comitee_desc: "자본주의 체제를 개혁하는 것은 매우 힘든 과제이며 국가 할당량과 경제 계획만을 통해서 이를 달성 할 수 없습니다. 평의회는 직종별 노동조합의 지역 대표를 소집하여 전문적인 노동자를 보호하며 경제 성장에 적합한 방법을 찾을 것입니다."
 CSA_councilism: "평의회주의"
 CSA_councilism_desc: "미국의 오래된 관료제를 유지하는 것은 무의미합니다. 분권화된 노동자 협의회의 이행에 있어 직능별 조합과 산업노조 사이의 타협이 성사되었습니다. 이들 협의회는 각 주들이 노조가 조직되는 방식에 자율권을 행사할 수 있도록 허용할 것입니다."
 CSA_federalism: "연방주의"
 CSA_federalism_desc: "비록 구 미국이 정치적 부패와 게리멘더링 그리고 비효율적 행정 조직의 원산지였지만, 그 행정 체제는 우리 국가의 정체성의 초석이었죠. 우리는 우리 시민들이 가진 주에 대한 애정을 파괴할 수 없습니다. 대신 우리는 주의 오래된 결함을 조정 할 수 있을 것입니다."
 CSA_power_to_the_people: "비노조가맹원 사회보장법"
 CSA_power_to_the_people_desc: "노령 연금 운동가들의 촉구에 따라, 의회는 노조에 가입하지 않은 노동자들을 위한 사회 보장법의 재정 확충을 추진하도록 했습니다. 이러한 가치는 우리의 사회주의적 이상에 부합하며, 노조의 보호를 받지 못하는 산업 분야에 종사하는 노동자가 퇴직 연금 등 노조 가맹 노동자에 준하는 보호를 받을 수 있게 합니다."
 CSA_federalist_economics: "사업조합주의"
 CSA_federalist_economics_desc: "노조연맹 내의 많은 사람들이 '사업조합주의'라는 아이디어를 혁명에 대한 배신이라고 조롱합니다. 이 순수주의자들이 깨닫지 못한 점은 미국에서 자본주의가 200년간 지속되었기 때문에 사회주의로의 전환을 완화하기 위한 중간 경제가 필요할 것이라는 것입니다. 따라서, 의회는 리드가 통과시킨 국가 통제 가격 책정을 폐지했습니다."
 CSA_mutualism: "보호주의 정책"
 CSA_mutualism_desc: "전문노동자평의회는 미국 상품을 보호하기 위한 보호 무역 정책을 펼치기로 결론 내렸습니다. 하지만 이것은 과거 스무트-홀리 관세법 같은 극단적인 관세 정책을 의미하지 않습니다. 단지 국내에서만 영업하는 조합들에 대한 세금 감면을 확대하고 미국 국내 제품의 구매를 권유하는 프로파간다와 같은 첫 번째 벨트크리크 때와 비슷한 수준의 부드러운 보호 무역 정책을 실행 할 것입니다."
 CSA_workers_cooperatives: "노동자 협동조합"
 CSA_workers_cooperatives_desc: "산업 노동조합의 지배는 기업들의 종말을 의미하는 것이 아닙니다. 우리는 단순히 불공정한 이익을 추구하는 사업자를 교체할 것을 원할 뿐입니다. 대신에 노동자들이 그들의 작업장내에서 결정을 할 수 있게 하고 거기서 나오는 부를 그들 스스로 공정하게 분배할 것입니다."
 CSA_social_dividends: "사회적 분배"
 CSA_social_dividends_desc: "평의회는 기본 소득제 도입하는 법안을 통과시켰습니다. 국영기업에서 나오는 모든 이윤의 일부를 시민들에게 분배 될 것입니다. 우리 노동자들이 단순한 수동적 존재가 아니라 우리 국가의 운영을 주시하는 존재입니다. 그렇기 때문에 그들은 미국의 공공 자산의 일부를 받을 자격이 있습니다."
 CSA_public_owned_enterprise: "공공소유 기업"
 CSA_public_owned_enterprise_desc: "공기업은 오랫동안 미국에서 회피되었던 문제였고, 수많은 미국의 전 대통령들이 그들의 유권자보다 대기업에게 더 큰 관심을 가졌습니다. 허나, 우리가 기업의 멍에를 박살낸 현재, 회의는 마침내 공기업을 미국 경제에서 사용할 여지를 찾아냈습니다. 루즈벨트주의와 환경보호활동가들만이 우리의 발목을 잡을 뿐입니다!"
 CSA_american_syndicalism: "신미국 생디칼리슴"
 CSA_american_syndicalism_desc: "미국은 마침내 착취적인 자본주의를 뒤로 하고 빛나는 미래를 향해 열심히 행진하고 있습니다. 비록 평의회에서 순수주의자 의원들은 ‘미국적 특색의 생디칼리슴’에 대해 거부하고 있지만, 그들은 산업의 성장과 힘 앞에서는 어떤 무게감도 없으며, 우리 인민들은 이러한 거대한 번영을 기뻐하는 중입니다!"
 CSA_unionist_economics: "산업조합주의"
 CSA_unionist_economics_desc: "비록 일부는 미국의 자본주의와 생디칼리슴이 결합된 정책을 옹호하지만, 우리가 구 체제와 타협할 수 없음은 명백합니다. 이제 노동조합들이 우리 경제를 지배하기 위해 일어나야 하며, just as unions now form the basis of every part of the Commonwealth government."
 CSA_industrial_unionism: "생디칼리스트 지배"

Although this step has its advantages, it is definitely not supported by people who consider this a return to U.S. centralisation policies."
 CSA_state_air_force: "주 공군"
 CSA_state_air_force_desc: "While some members of the government suggest the Air Force be subordinate to the central command - the first intention was to decentralise the Air Force and create their branches at the states' level. Although this will limit our ability to train pilots for long-distance flights, they will be more effective in supporting the troops with which they will share training even in peacetime."
 CSA_wings_of_revolution: "혁명의 날개"
 CSA_wings_of_revolution_desc: "In time of the Second Revolution pilots, who put their lives on the line for those who have come after them, made a great sacrifice so that the people of America will be the first in the air. Now when we have returned our aviation industry to the pre-war level and trained our pilots to mastery that can never be reached by capitalist countries, we are ready to protect workers in all parts of the world."

 CSA_professionalize_continental_army_desc: "Despite the opposition of some political circles to this step, our high command has a plan to professionalise our militias and turn them into a proper army. Although our lower-level commanders and some militias are concerned about this step and look at it as a return to pre-revolutionary times, this will definitely improve the effectiveness of our soldiers and command."
 CSA_states_red_guards: "주 방위적위대"
 CSA_states_red_guards_desc: "Most of our political apparatus insists on the creation of state militias who will submit to the central command only in wartime. Although the proposed plan is close to the pre-war organisation of the US Army, there is a big difference - since any militias will be subordinate only to the local state's army command - and which, in turn, will be subordinate to the central command."
 CSA_distribution_of_duties: "의무의 분배"
 CSA_distribution_of_duties_desc: "While our the State Army Commands will plan the battles, our central command should concentrate its efforts on planning entire campaigns, supply lines and interaction between the armies of different states. This will allow us to quickly and efficiently solve any problems that the army may encounter in the war and defend the Second Revolution from reactionaries."
 CSA_armies_of_states: "각 주의 군대"
 CSA_armies_of_states_desc: "After the new army reform, we decided to organise separate State Armies that will be responsible for training our soldiers, for their equipment and commanding them on the battlefields. Although this has led to great zeal and the arrival of a huge number of recruits in our new armies, we need to set minimum standards for them."
 CSA_american_red_guard_corps: "미 적위대"
 CSA_american_red_guard_corps_desc: "The reforms were successful, but a decentralised army cannot quickly respond to some problems on the battlefields without the force that will be directly subordinated to our high command. The Department of the Commander-in-Chief has already proposed the creation of the American Red Guard Corps, which will be under the direct supervision of the headquarters of the Continental Army."
 CSA_revolutionary_naval_industry: "혁명 해군 산업"
 CSA_revolutionary_naval_industry_desc: "The superiority of the old U.S fleet was not only in our commanders, but also in Fleet size. Although we still do not have as many shipyards and factories as the United States had before the war, we can focus on specific ships and simplify production."
 CSA_new_american_dockyards: "미국의 새로운 조선소"
 CSA_new_american_dockyards_desc: "Most shipyards were damaged or lost their workers during the Second Revolution. The restoration of the old and the reform of the present naval facilities will be the second step towards the restoration of the American Navy.

 CSA_new_naval_plan: "신해군계획"
 CSA_new_naval_plan_desc: "With the victory in the Civil War, the American fleet was harshly damaged - many officers and sailors joined the reactionary forces and fought against the will of the people. In the end, when they were defeated, they damaged and destroyed their ships. Our oldest naval commanders propose starting the restoration of the American fleet to its former status."
 CSA_american_peoples_navy_desc: "With the Civil War over, some politicians say that our current need is to protect the American people. The idea was proposed to reintroduce the old American naval doctrine - but an additional proposal was made by former members of the Naval Militia who joined our side - creation of a new American Navy based on states' command, which would unite under leadership of the central command only in wartime."
 CSA_refit_old_ships: "구식 함선 개장"
 CSA_refit_old_ships_desc: "Our fleet mainly consists of old ships that date from the beginning of the 20th century or even the end of the 19th century.

Some of them have developed plans and equipment to improve the conversion of our ships to modern standards."

 CSA_revolution_on_high_seas_desc: "The old federal fleet was limited to 'naval traditions' that did not allow them to see that aircraft carriers would rule the oceans in the future. Although our oldest admirals are still inclined to the idea of 'big guns and armour', they agreed that the aircraft was very effective against enemy ships. We need to ensure that the new American Navy receives air support when it is needed in any part of the world."
 CSA_recreate_continental_marines: "대륙해병대 재창설"
 CSA_recreate_continental_marines_desc: "In the past, the Continental Marine Corps proudly fought against the British oppressors. Many of the soldiers of its successor, the U. S. Marine Corps, under the command of Smedley Butler, joined us when we met with the capitalists in the Second Revolutionary War. With recreation of the navy, we need to be sure that we organise and train forces that can meet with other enemies of the Revolution abroad."
 CSA_navy_of_new_age: "새로운 세기의 해군"
 CSA_navy_of_new_age_desc: "The second revolution almost destroyed the navy, and none of us expected that we could recreate the old American fleet. But it was restored - perhaps not in the same quantity and form, but now the old ships have been replaced by new ones. Without the old biased admirals, naval tactics have been modernised. And now the New American Navy is ready to defend freedom in America - or around the world."
 CSA_armour_development: "기갑 개발"
 CSA_armour_development_desc: "The role of armour was neglected by the old America, and now we must make great strides in very little time to update our forces. With the experience that we gained in the Civil War and handed over to our engineers, we already have several proposals for creating a modern tank."
 CSA_armoured_vehicles_industry: "장갑차량 산업"
 CSA_armoured_vehicles_industry_desc: "The Civil War forced us to rely on motorised units and proved their effectiveness. But it also showed that motorised infantry needed more armoured vehicles which could protect them on the battlefield from enemy bullets and shells."
 CSA_anti_tank_production: "대전차포 생산"
 CSA_anti_tank_production_desc: "Enemy armour is worthless when faced with high ordnance and dedicated anti-tank units that can smash them to pieces. Unlike tanks, we can attach anti-tank guns to our units and produce them in greater numbers."
 CSA_continental_red_army: "대륙 적군"
 CSA_continental_red_army_desc: "Our army needs only the best soldiers. For this purpose, the local Red Guards will be transformed into our reserve forces, which will be drafted into the army in case of war. Already trained by army standards, with the same equipment - they can replenish our army if necessary. But this also means that we must raise our standards for the Red Guard."
 CSA_increase_military_spending: "군비 증액"
 CSA_increase_military_spending_desc: "The Civil War devastated the American Civilian industry, but has made the Military Industry quite a profitable enterprise.

TUUL을 대표하는 월리엄 포스터는 IWW에 우호적인 입장을 표명하며 “연공서열과 회비는 뇌물과 다를게 없으며, 생디칼리슴의 전위대들은 이를 지지할 수 없다”고 감명깊은 연설을 했습니다. 또한 만약 IWW의 주장을 관철시키기 위해 TUUL은 IWW을 적극적으로 지원 할 의사가 있다고 밝혔습니다."

More-over, Reed emphasised his role was to see the country through to the revolution, but a new leader needs to lead it now. Of the attendees at the Congress, two have gained the most prominence. One is Earl Browder, currently Secretary of Communications, who has taken his allies for State Planned Economy and has begun advertising his own campaign on state media. The other is William Foster, a major force in the Constitutional Convention for getting the AFL to advocate centralism, who has called in his connections for his campaign. There is an understanding that even though this position of leadership is interim until the election, it still will allow either president to exert a great deal of influence over the country's groundwork."

In a stark turn for the party, Blomen did not participate in the civil war, preferring to hold to his ideal of a 'bloodless revolution' that would abolish capitalism - it's hoped that Blomen's brand of idealistic socialism will prove palatable to $CSA_radical_socialist_party_abbrev$ voters who have come to view the party has complacent.\n\nBlomen and the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$ have campaigned on the message of the 'American malaise', charging the Johnson administration as a do-nothing government that has lost touch with the issues that Americans face. According to Johnson, this malaise is an invention of the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$, and that the relative quiet of his government is indicative of some of the best times in American history. He maintains that he has been active in federal education programs as he always has been. This has led to the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$ jesting about Johnson's 'elementary school socialism', arguing that Johnson's overfocus on education has come at the expense of other social issues, and is proof that the $CSA_radical_socialist_party$ has finally lost its grip reality.\n\nAt the end of this, the parties reconvened in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and voted.

With the ascension of William Foster comes a dedication to the dream of creating a more perfect union, as opposed to a greater union. Foster has drafted a plan with James W. Ford to ensure the perpetual safety and self determination of African American minorities in the South. This plan is to create a Black Belt in the south of autonomous communities with their own representatives separate from Congress. While the ruling party as a whole supports this, several critics from other parties note that this policy would create an unequal standard for civil rights."

 csa.70.t: "Reactions to the Black Belt"
 csa.70.d: "The African-American community is split over the Black Belt. On one hand it dramatically increased the number of black Vanguard politicians and in the country overall, as the independent communes required elected officials. On the other hand several non vanguard black politicians in the North have faced issues with promoting a colourblind society. They debate whether to continue seeking civil rights that would remove all racial differences in laws, or to expand the Black Belt northwards."
 csa.70.a: "We stand firm."
 csa.71.t: "The Great Sedition Trial of [GetYear]"
 csa.71.d: "Demand for food to feed the armies and citizens of a starving, war-torn Europe led many commercially-minded Southern landowners to grow corn and wheat during the years of the Weltkrieg. For nearly a decade, sales to Europe during and after the war made landowners, bankers, and commercial insurers rich, but this prosperity would not last. In 1925, the British Revolution wracked the United Kingdom, precipitating a debt crisis as scores of Britons lost their lives' savings and as even the British government went into a de-facto default, plunging the United States into the Great Depression. To make matters worse for the South, the recovery of the German agricultural sector following demobilisation caused demand for food crops to plummet even further.\n\nThe tenant farmers who had worked the land for the landowners that had profited during the high times responded by unionising during the lows. With some encouragement from Norman Thomas, sharecropper and gas-station worker Harry Leland Mitchell and his friend Clay East formed the Southern Tenants Farmers' Union in 1934, eventually coming to affiliate with the AFL-CIO. However, during the turbulent years leading up to the Revolution, many members of the STFU were taken in by Huey Long's populist rhetoric, and openly supported the America Firsters. Since the end of the Second American Civil War, the STFU has only continued to attract Longists and other seditious elements seeking to use it as a cover to legitimise their presence in the new America.\n\nToday, however, the STFU met its fate before the unions as a bailiff presented Mitchell and East to a union court on charges of sedition, high treason, and harbouring reactionaries and crypto-Longists such as Francis Townsend, one of the chief architects of Long's \"Share Our Wealth\" program and who was found by the CIA in Tyronza, Arkansas after East confessed to CIA agents that he had harboured Townsend and his wife at his home.\n\nPresident Browder, for his part, is said to be privately ecstatic at finally having the chance to destroy such a dangerous pocket of resistance as he turns the increasingly mighty state apparatus of the Union of Socialist American States to the task of dismantling the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union and turning their lands directly to the purposes of the state."
 csa.71.a: "Good riddance to bad unions!"
 csa.72.t: "The International Peace Movement disbanded"
 csa.72.d: "The revolution against capitalism drew a line in the sand. You were either with the union or a scab, that mantra worked for John Reed, but not for Earl Browder. It has come to his attention a despicable group of infiltrators into the new America in the form of the International Peace Movement. This dangerous group, led by a little man who thinks he's god, has resisted conscription and collectivisation. Their communes in New York and Philadelphia may be racially integrated, but their adherence to gender segregation in the name of a religious code is utterly reactionary. We have seized IPM members for de-programming, and their communes are now safely in the hands of Trade Union Unity League members."
 csa.72.a: "You're not God, little man."
 csa.73.t: "Foster dissolves the AFL"
 csa.73.d: "The Vanguard party has finally succeeded in reforming the American Federation of Labor, by dissolving it. Foster and the Central Committee were sure that labour leaders within the AFL such as John L. Lewis were dismantling the dignity of labour by adopting industrial unionist tactics. These tactics include trying to force wall-to-wall voting on trades where expertise is clearly correlated to competence and allowing new employees to outshout veterans. The tipping point was when a mail bomb was discovered near President Foster's home, which was traced back to the AFL. All other legal means to stop the AFL leaders from despoiling their craft did not work, so the Vanguard is forced to intervene directly. Lewis, among many other AFL traitors was arrested and will stand trial for their crimes against Labour."

 csa.75.d: "The workshops of the River Rouge Plant have been a known hotbed for violent activity. It was there that Edsel Ford was shot by an anarchist for his betrayal of the working class, a rash action by agitated workers. It comes as no surprise that it was here where workers struck out against the United Auto Workers in a Wildcat Strike. The UAW rightly asked the Vanguard party for assistance, and boy did they deliver. After the workers were rendered inert, [CSA.GetLeader] broadcast a new policy to America banning Wildcat Strikes. No longer will mobs rule over the appointed American government."

The story follows the Joads, a family from Oklahoma and their troubles during the Depression prior to the revolution. The story illustrates the weight that federally enforced capitalism puts onto their average lives and drags their traditional values through the mud of reality. The movie does deviate from the book with the ending on a much more optimistic tone, showing the family working for the revolution overthrow their California work camp. The main protagonist Tom Joad chooses to stay with his family instead of fleeing into the night, declaring his intention to set up a Red Guard in California to reclaim his farm in Oklahoma. The film has been well regarded by both critics and the public, particularly because of the necessary edit."

A top priority of the PCC is to replant trees in the Midwest, the source of the dust storms that threaten our food supply.

 csa.88.d: "On the face of Stone Mountain, deep in the state of Georgia, lies a long stalled government supported project to carve bas-reliefs to honour the Confederate side of the last civil war. The site has been a hotbed of neo-Confederate activity, a history that has included hosting the site of the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan. Many wish to remove such a blight from the land of the new America, especially as other monuments to the Confederacy are torn down. However, people are divided with regards to the specifics of the incomplete project, which had run out of funding and seen highly public infighting by its patrons in the 1920s. Some believe the limited work done should be destroyed and the mountain allowed to heal the best it can, especially since the face of Robert E. Lee was already blasted off in 1928. James Ford, in a cynical turn, wishes to continue the project but feature Jemmy, John Brown and George Padmore, feeling that these heroes of African-American emancipation are best-suited to inspire the new America. Diego Rivera, the artist behind the renovation of Rockefeller Plaza, suggests a cheap and honourable compromise. The relief will be chiselled down to replace the Confederates with leaders of Socialist thinking and revolution. Those being Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and John Reed. A redesign wouldn't be completely out of order given the numerous development issues the monument has faced and indeed the project had already been scaled back and replanned even before the revolution.

Before the revolution and during the war, life was hard for our fellow Americans. Many had to suffer the loss of a loved one, life-threatening financial insecurity during the crisis years or persecution. This lead to behaviour the old society may have deemed wrong or sinful, but our brave President Foster must look beyond traditions. For those whose souls suffered too deep an injury to carry on, we must allow them to phase out. Despite our censorship of the Daily Worker, massive protests by Christian Workers Unions, intelligentsia, and community support networks claim that Foster's 'suicide law' is merely a pretence to excuse mysterious deaths and disappearances. The more conspiratorial rightists even claim this is a plot by Foster to legalise murder so long as it looks like suicide.

 csa.90.d: "필름 몽타주와 근대주의 작가, 그리고 사회주의자인 존 더스 패서스의 신작 <미국>이 출간되었습니다. 이 책은 혁명과 대공황 속에서 살아야 했던 12명의 미국인들의 이야기이며, 패서스의 글은 신문과 선전 그리고 몇달동안 해방 이전의 거리에서 들은 무시무시한 대화들을 결합시킨 것입니다. 보통 이런 독창적이고도 창의적인 글이라면 미국 작가 회의에서 회자되며 많은 찬사를 얻었겠지만, 지금 학계는 침묵만을 지킬 뿐입니다. 이 책이 내전기 CSA 군인에 의한 불법적인 살인 행위들을 묘사했기 때문이었습니다. 작가회의의 명목상 대표인 어니스트 허밍웨이는 이를 사회주의 정부에 대한 반역과 선동 행위임을 주장했지만, 책을 검열하고 그를 구속하기로 한 결정은 의회에서 기각되었습니다."

The workers of America rarely got to enjoy the luxuries that they created, stolen as they were by capitalists even though they rightly belonged to the people. How many of the struggling masses got to enjoy picnics or visits to the national parks when they had to work so many hours just to survive and feed their children? No longer will this be the case. The various local unions across the country, regardless of which federation they belong to, have begun to take over and manage various cultural centres as well as help sponsor vacations. This is supported by the government at both a local level and national level as a way to boost productivity and encourage comradeship."

As part of the program to ensure that the American worker is relieved of responsibilities which President Foster has termed \"A millstone about the neck of the workers\" Today the first train from Chicago to the rural plains in the centre of our country has left with children from mothers and fathers who work in important positions in the industrial heartland. The kids will be safe on the countless fields and ranches in the pastures, making themselves useful in farm labour and running errands, living a healthy life. This frees their parents to wage revolution with all their hearts and energy. With the success of this first train, Foster has proposed to his cabinet to make this a mandatory arrangement throughout the USAS, even going so far as to propose that children be taken by force from more stubborn worker families for their own good."

With the recent election of the Farmer-Labor Party, a furious debate has broken out regarding the possibility of a peaceful reunification. While our government is favourable to many of [CSA.GetNameDef]'s policies, they are also far more radical, and will be negotiating from a position of strength - meaning we will be forced to accept many hard compromises.

This will take resources and experienced workers from other places, but allow us to prepare for a naval war against the Federal Government. Our captains are divided into two groups - supporters of destroyers or submarines. The first group are insisting destroyers can fight against most enemy ships, and can also support our main ships in battle. The second group says that submarines are more efficient and can work alone at large distances without the support of the main forces of the fleet.

After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from Alpena Airfield and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Custer. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was William N. \"Red\" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their exercise goals, making the experiment a success."

 csa.209.d: "With the success of our scheduled mass jumps and with the blessing of high officers and politicians, Fort Custer had begun taking volunteers for paratrooper units. While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorised a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a recruitment drive, the number of volunteers was enough to form 3 paratrooper divisions for us to utilise. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the Continental Army Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

The war hero had checked into the Philadelphia Naval Hospital the month prior, reportedly having been sick for several weeks. Upon admission, doctors discovered he had an incurable gastrointestinal condition and in spite of their best care, Butler passed away the following fortnight surrounded by his loved ones.\n\nHaving only recently announced his retirement after seeing the end of the Second American Civil War, Butler oversaw important reforms and overhauls to the Second Continental Army, transforming it into a well organised fighting force that ultimately saw the emancipation of the working class all across the continental United States. His death has rocked the nation to its core, with many in the army still believing his work in guiding it to be unfinished.\n\nAt Capitol Hill, a full state funeral was given in commemoration of him including military honours. The procession led by fellow Marines who had fought alongside him for many years.

 CSA_earl_browder_leader_desc: "Born in Kansas, in the year of 1891, Browder became a committed socialist at age 16. His allegiance to the Socialist Party of America was unshakable, and through an early friendship with William Foster, he became a syndicalist. As the years passed, the two men began to drift apart. While Foster favoured an authoritarian form of syndicalism, Browder began to see more and more limits with the movement. The American revolution has according to him, proven that the same beliefs and strategies used in Europe cannot be applied to America. His new economic policy has been built with inspiration from Bolshevism, reinterpretations of Maximism, and plenty of original thought. Browder also intends to end the persistent trend of industrial unionism in Congress, and to pursue lecherous religious elements within the socialist state. Browder has never abandoned the Socialist Party of America, but with his new authoritarian position he intends to ensure that the party will never abandon him."
 CSA_jack_reed_leader_desc: "As the United States crashed into flame and a Syndicalist revolution grew in the Steel Belt, at its forefront stood John 'Jack' Reed - a writer, a trade unionist, a journalist and a Senator, if not more. Born to a business family on the West Coast, he lived an unassuming upper-class life until studies in Harvard, where he, coming into contact with socialist clubs and literature, came to realise that there is a world beyond the dull halls of college, and that world suffered constant hardship. Despite being in poor health from birth, Reed chose a traveller's life, working as a common labourer to make a living and travel from nation to nation, and gaining fame as a war correspondent.\n\nWhat earned him more fame, however, was his involvement in the great revolutions of the period. The first he witnessed was the Mexican one as early as 1913, then the Russian one, in 1917, which he worked for devoutly and which consolidated his revolutionary socialist beliefs. It was during this time period that he wrote the 10 Days That Shook the World, his most famous work. In 1918, he returned to America, but was no longer welcome by America and its anti-sedition acts, so a year later, he fled again - this time to France, to a new, brewing revolution, and unlike the Russian one, actually successful. Fighting alongside the French Syndicalists dictated Reed a goal in life - to import this success to America, to have it be the next to come, and with America's unfathomable industrial might, bring forth a world revolution.\n\nA long time has passed since then, and Reed has achieved far - he has helped orchestrate the union of American socialists into one united front, served as a Senator, as a Presidential candidate, and has finally called the Steel Belt to revolution. However, his goal remains the same - to be the next great revolutionary, to be the same figure greater than life which the lowly war correspondent from twenty years ago would write about."
 CSA_elizabeth_gurley_flynn_leader_desc: "At a dusty underground socialist club in Harlem, Elizabeth Flynn's life as an advocate began. An early organiser for the IWW in New Jersey, Flynn felt the blunt of the political wrath against forming trade unions, and was arrested ten times. Flynn helped found the ACLU, which organised legal defence for strikers in the days before the International Labor Defense. In the leadup to the civil war, Flynn helped organise the longshoremen strike of the West Coast. Flynn's wartime speeches to the Central Committee to encourage conscription made her stand out to the numerous conscientious objectors in the Committee. Ultimately Flynn was elected to lead America as a shocking dark horse candidate. Some thought it absurd that a woman would stand at the forefront of the revolution, but the rebel girl herself had been at the spearhead all along, fighting since the founding of the IWW and now ready to build up a socialist America of her dreams."
 CSA_daniel_hoan_leader_desc: "Daniel Webster Hoan is one of the enduring figures of the American left - born in Waukesha, Wisconsin on March 12, 1881, Hoan enrolled in the University of Wisconsin and swiftly laid out the foundation for the university's Socialist Club, back when it had a mere four members. Hoan was admitted to the state bar in 1908 and moved to Milwaukee, where the longtime Socialist Party member began working with Victor Berger, editor of The Milwaukee Leader, in advocating for radical reforms to the city: public ownership of utilities, urban development programs, free legal, medical, and educational services, and other policies widely unheard of in most of the country. Hoan decided to enter politics by running for city attorney in 1910, where he edged out a plurality against both Democratic and Republican opponents - in the same year, Emil Seidel was elected mayor of Milwaukee, the first socialist to leader to a major American city. In 1916, Hoan succeeded him as mayor, a position that he continued to hold all the way until the Second Civil War. As mayor, Hoan codified what is sometimes called 'constructive socialism', emphasising practical reforms over haughty revolutionary ideals - some more itinerant socialists derisively called the Milwaukee branch members 'sewer socialists' for their constant touting of their city's sewer system.\n\nHoan silenced most doubts to his commitment during the war, proving invaluable to organising the Milwaukee war effort. With the revolution won and the Socialist Party's factions diverging, Hoan was expected to remain loyal to the moderate party core - however, shocking some observers, the breakaway Workers' Party declared that they would nominate him as their candidate for President in the 1940 elections. More astute observers noted that Hoan had not always gotten along with other Socialists during his time with the party, and that he didn’t seem to share the remaining membership’s pacifist tendencies. Whatever the reason, Hoan provides considerable legitimacy to the young Workers' Party, and to many represents a new sense of practicality for a revolution looking to settle down."
 CSA_frank_johns_leader_desc: "Initially a carpenter from Oregon, Frank Johns became the leading figure of the regional Socialist Labor Party. Running twice for congress and twice for the presidency, Johns seemed doomed to a lifetime of obscurity as a fringe party candidate. That was until he went through a near death experience in 1928, nearly drowning in an attempt to save a young boy whom had fallen in a frigid river. Forced to retire from the Socialist Labor Party in order to recover from the incident, Johns was given enough time to think and plot out a new career. He began to correspond with several members of the Socialist Party of America, and after being released from the hospital he went on to join them as a fiery orator. Emboldened by his heroism and having narrowly avoided death, Johns later threw himself into the Second American Civil War as a capable and courageous militia leader. Thanks to his military accomplishments and personal reputation, he has now finally been elected President of a brand new America!"
 CSA_eleanor_roosevelt_leader_desc: "At first glance, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt as the leader of a Syndicalist revolution seems to be a paradox. Born and raised as a socialite in the wealthy and influential Roosevelt family, she was not with the Combined Syndicates when the revolution began, remaining in New England and hoping until the last moment that a peace could be found. While supportive of the workers' struggle, her revolutionary credentials are lacking, and she hardly fits the image of the jumped-up union boss that many associate with our young nation's leadership. Her opponents insist that these appearances are not deceiving - diehard supporters of the revolution call her a Trojan horse for the bourgeoisie, while opponents of the new government decry her as a laughable attempt by the socialists to convince the American people that they aren't bloodthirsty tyrants.\n\nAnd yet, when one considers it, the logic becomes a bit more clear. The triumph of the Combined Syndicates created a problem for both the old American elite and the new revolutionary government: the former had been defeated and left ostracised in the new America, while the latter was faced with a population that was and is reluctant to trust them. In Roosevelt, the Workers' Party saw a solution to both - a reconciliatory figure that might unite the supporters of the revolution with feminists, African-Americans, and reformists and ease the reintegration of old elites into society. Whether this controversial plan will work remains to be seen, but what is certain is that with her ascent to the presidency, America will yet again never be the same."
 CSA_frank_zeidler_leader_desc: "Frank Paul Zeidler, born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on September 12, 1912, has spent much of his life in poor health - an unfortunate reality that prevented him from completing his studies. Perhaps because of this, Zeidler was drawn to socialism from a young age - growing up in the throes of the Great Depression, Zeidler read extensively from left-wing writers like Norman Thomas and Eugene V. Debs. When asked about his reasons for supporting socialism in 1933, Zeidler cited the tenets of international brotherhood, the struggle for peace, equal distribution of goods, cooperation, and democratic planning. He would become active in the Socialist Party of America's youth wing, the Young People's Socialist League, and shortly before the civil war became the head of the Milwaukee branch of the Red Falcons, another SPA organisation aimed at educating children. Frank was aided in his activist work by his brother, Carl Zeidler, who would go on to volunteer for the navy of the Combined Syndicates, only to die in the effort.\n\nDespite his perpetual sickly health and the untimely death of his brother, Zeidler did what he could to support the Syndicate war effort on the home front, and attended the constitutional convention on the behalf of Milwaukee mayor Daniel Hoan. In the post-war political scene, Zeidler was seen as relatively neutral figure (outside of his disdain for the Unity League), and was tapped by the Workers' Party to be the successor to President Flynn largely for this reason - after all, the WPA holds dearly to the idea of a symbolic executive, and the martyrdom of his brother generates much sympathy among veterans of the revolution. Only 36 years old on his election, President Zeidler comes in as a symbol of the unity between the senior professional revolutionaries and a generation of young socialists that have swiftly been maturing with the new America."
 CSA_elmer_allison_leader_desc: "A self-taught radical from Missouri, Elmer Allison was a founding member of both the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. He was a leading figure in the SPA's radical Washington affiliate, spending much of his life either working in the local cedar mills or atop a soapbox in the streets of Seattle. A series of raids and near arrests by the Department of Justice saw him go underground, but he remerged as a political figure when he helped lead the brief rebellion known as the Seattle Commune in 1923. During the Commune's existence he met Jack Reed, striking up a friendship with the famed journalist and following him to New York City. There he was a major figure in running Reed's numerous political campaigns and leading the SPA's entry into mainstream politics. Following the revolution, his close comradeship to Reed and his zealous socialist beliefs has made him an obvious candidate for the presidency. A candidacy he gladly pursued!"
 CSA_james_cannon_leader_desc: "Personally mentored by Big Bill Haywood and well-versed in the struggles of the American left, James Cannon became an unshakable presence within the Socialist Party of America. Although initially a fanatic adherent to Bolshevism, the failure of the Russian Revolution contrasted with the triumph of the French syndicalists caused Cannon to adopt a more libertarian view on socialism. As a formal representative of the SPA, he spent much time abroad in France and Britain, before returning to America after the outbreak of the civil war. Helping to organise foreign volunteers and the Internationale's advisors, he cemented his reliability as a brilliant administrator. With the war won, Cannon immediately began to build the momentum needed to run for President, and has now finally fulfilled his ambition!"
 CSA_henning_blomen_leader_desc: "A son of Massachusetts born in 1910, Henning was too young to experience the horrors of the Weltkrieg, but old enough to face the American Revolution in his prime. Initially an industrial worker in Cambridge, he was one of the few who did not leave his station the moment the first gunshots of the Second American Civil War could be heard. A committed pacifist, Henning Blomen instead helped organise the chemical plant he worked at into a cooperative syndicate. His efforts were greatly appreciated by his more radical co-workers, who nominated him as a Massachusetts representative to the Combined Syndicates and helped him cross the front lines to New York City. Soon climbing his way up the political ladder, Henning Blomen has continuously made a name for himself with his unshakable optimism and iron will, running over a dozen major political races in his lifetime, the most recent of which has carried him all the way to the presidency."
 CSA_norman_thomas_leader_desc: "Norman Thomas has seen the lows and the highs of social stature, and remained dedicated to socialism the entire way through from newspaper boy to Princeton magna cum laude to conscientious objector. Prior to the civil war he had served as New York City's mayor and Jack Reed's vice-presidential candidate. Thomas pivoted his pacifism during the war into advocacy for socialists living in the Federal lands to resist conscription. After the war, he used his learned experience and close friendship to Jack Reed, preaching on behalf of the Federalists to lead the democratic socialists to victory in the Second Constitutional Convention. With a heart of gold and unshakable morals, Norman Thomas has ascended to the presidency."
 CSA_upton_sinclair_leader_desc: "Born in 1878, in Baltimore, Upton Sinclair was an aspiring author from an early age. In his teens he wrote pulp magazines and poetry to make a living, eventually moving into investigative journalism. His moment in the spotlight came after he spent seven weeks disguised as a worker in Chicago's meatpacking plants, drafting a political expose on the poor labour conditions of the plants. Although Sinclair had hoped to rally the country behind the worker's cause, he instead merely exposed the lack of hygiene in the meatpacking industry; in response to this reaction, he declared \"I aimed for the country's heart, but hit them in the stomach\". With the profits from his literary career, Sinclair pursued politics in California, launching the \"End Poverty In California\" campaign. E.P.I.C, as it came to be known, was not the roaring triumph he had expected, but gave Sinclair enough fame and recognition that he could later pursue a second political career in the new America. Now championing an E.P.I.C movement applied nationwide, Upton Sinclair has won the recent presidential election with a startling margin."
 CSA_john_llewellyn_lewis_leader_desc: "The son of Welsh immigrants whom had settled in Iowa, John Lewis grew up in a company town dominated by the coal industry. At the age of 17 he went to work as a minister, becoming more and more embroiled in his hometown’s local politics and the nationwide labour movement. In 1907 he made a failed attempt to run for mayor, and later became a full-time union advocate who travelled across the Steel Belt. Although he initially bickered with William Foster over the merits of syndicalist trade unions compared to his preferred moderate and apolitical unions, the devastation of the Great Depression saw him slowly embrace more radical beliefs. Despite having once been a liberal and a republican, Lewis could not find it in his heart to endorse President Hoover's second term. Increasingly disillusioned with competitive capitalism, Lewis struck up negotiations with the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. When the American Revolution came, he had made up his mind for which side to stand on. Although his reactionary past continued to haunt him, Lewis eventually succeeded in finding a synthesis between radical unionism and his own moderate ideology, being elected as President in the latest election."
 CSA_israel_amter_leader_desc: "Israel Amter was born on March 26, 1881 to Jewish parents, namely a father that was immigrated from the city of Riga, then held by the Russian Empire. Amter briefly joined the Socialist Party of America in 1901 before moving to Germany in 1903, becoming a member of the Social Democratic Party and studying music at the Leipzig Conservatory. Eventually, Amter found it necessary to return to the United States to escape the war, and after the move renewed his SPA membership and became active within the party's left wing. It is here that Amter had his first brush with the law - in April 1921, he and three others were arrested in a joint raid by New York bomb squad police and Department of Justice agents. Since then, Amter became particularly active in the SPA's more militant underground circles that aimed at preparing the working classes for the final conflict against capitalism - work that only grew in importance as the country veered closer and closer to civil war. Amter was eventually arrested yet again in 1930 alongside William Foster in connection to a riot that took place during the party's International Unemployment Day protest campaign, for which he was convicted and spent some time in prison.\n\nAlthough seemingly a strange choice for the Socialist Party's 1948 nominee for President, it could also be said that [CSA.GetNameDef]'s political scene has become equally strange - the moderating tendency that the Workers' Party has developed has led to the Socialists determining that the best avenue of attack is by rebranding their message as a renewal of the revolution, and that Amter's militant past makes him a perfect candidate for their realignment attempt. Time will tell whether President Amter will live up to these expectations."
 CSA_darlington_hoopes_leader_desc: "Darlington Hoopes came from a notable family of Pennsylvania Quakers. During his time at boarding school, he augmented his religious upbringing with an interest in radical socialism, going on to identify as a Christian socialist. His ideological beliefs soon drew him close to fellow Christian socialist Norman Thomas and the rest of the Socialist Party of America. In 1930, Hoopes was elected to the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania, where his most celebrated accomplishment was completely outlawing child labour in his home state. Much like it did to Thomas, the outbreak of the civil war disgusted Hoopes. Although he could not deny its accomplishments in hindsight, his political cause after the war was to champion reconstruction and reconciliation between Americans. This benevolent, reformative platform earned him more and more influence in the new America, allowing him to make a bid for the presidency."
 CSA_oakley_johnson_leader_desc: "A voracious reader since an early age, Oakley Johnson took up a career within academia, serving as a teacher and later principal at numerous schools in his home state of Minnesota. This lasted until his commitment to radical politics became more publicly known, and he was arrested in the middle of a seminar over having contributed money to the defence fund of arrested IWW members. Undeterred, Johnson moved to New York and became a full time activist in the Socialist Party of America, helping to promote interracial relations and the education of the proletariat. In 1936 he accepted a docent position at a university in Paris, spending most of the coming civil war abroad. In Paris he helped maintain diplomatic relations between the Commune of France and his comrades back home in America. Eventually making the trip to the new America, Oakley Johnson has used his diplomatic accomplishments and academic merits to woo the electorate!"
 CSA_asa_philip_randolph_leader_desc: "Asa Philip Randolph was born April 12, 1889 in Crescent City, Florida to a minister father and a seamstress mother. As a child growing up in Jacksonville, Randolph learned the importance of character over skin colour from the former, and the importance of education and defending oneself from the latter - he would later vividly recall a night from his youth where his mother sat in the front room of his house with a loaded shotgun, while his father took a pistol and left to prevent a man from being lynched at the county jail. A gifted student, Randolph enrolled in the Cookman Institute - then the only high school in Florida for African Americans - before being forced by employment segregation to move to New York City to study at City College. After a short attempt at theatre, Randolph became increasingly familiar with socialism, determining that people could only be free if not subjected to economic deprivation - with this in mind, Randolph began his civil rights career by establishing an employment office in Harlem aimed at providing work training to southern migrants. Randolph, along with his partner Chandler Owens and the aid of the Socialist Party of America, founded 'The Messenger', a radical magazine calling for African Americans to organise and fight for an integrated society. Randolph also developed strong union credentials, most famously organising the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters to address the deplorable working conditions of the primarily African American industry.\n\nAlthough Randolph was somewhat hesitant to embrace the cause of revolution by force, he, like many others, was left with little choice as civil war broke out regardless. During and after the war, Randolph continued to concern himself with the needs of African Americans as he always had, shifting his focus to union discrimination - arguing that the destruction of the colour barrier is a necessary component of a socialist America. For his efforts, he was picked as the Socialist Party's nominee for president - and with his election, President Randolph has become the first African American to lead America, providing hope to many that the days of racial inequality might, at long last, be drawing to a close."

He then rejoined the Army right during the start of the Punitive Expedition where he took up a garrison job in Mexico. He then signed up for an officers' course, from where he graduated as a second Lieutenant in 1917, and even did a short term in the Artillery corps, becoming an Artillery Captain in 1918. However, he was unsatisfied with his army positions, so he signed up in the Marine Corps in 1922 as a private, regardless of his previous postings. He was quickly promoted to Second Lieutenant, and served in a Marine outpost in Quantico, Virginia. He then sailed towards Culebra, Puerto Rico, in 1924 and remained there five months before being ordered to the West Coast for duty with the Pacific Fleet. Applying for aviation training in 1925, he went to Pensacola, Florida, for instruction, but subsequently returned to duty with ground units. He served another tour of foreign shore duty from 1927 to 1929 at Shanghai, China. He later returned to America and was quickly sent to Nicaragua to fight against Sandino's insurgency, earning a navy cross after facing around 100 rebels with just 12 marines. He also received a commendation after the 1931 earthquake and for his work as Chief of Police of Occupied Nicaragua. He returned to the US in 1933, and was sent to Shanghai, to the Marine Detachment in the American Legation in the Legation Cities, serving as Adjutant and studying Chinese. He returned to Quantico in 1936, attending the Marine Corps Schools while also taking a course on International Law and Politics at George Washington University in Washington, D.C... As the Nation spiralled into chaos, Smedley Butler began probing the Marine Corps for signs of dissenting opinions, and quickly found an ally in Evans. When the time finally came to join the Chicago Syndicalists in their fight, even despite being severely torn, Carlson decided to follow Butler and is now one of our Highest Ranking officers, and Butler's most trusted General."

In the Marine Corps, Shoup was recognised for his athletics, marksmanship, and leadership skills - impressing his commanders and subordinates for his ability to keep morale with his sense of humour. From 1927 to 1934, Shoup served in China, protecting American interests in the war-torn country, a mission he was personally opposed to seeing his actions as simply an imperialist exploitation of the Chinese people.

He did not see combat until the end of the war, when he was sent to deal with insurgents in the Philippines and was once again put in charge of soldiers of a different race. Parsons began to get gradually involved in military office politics, relying on his old superior Robert Lee Bullard from the Alabama 3rd to provide him with support for his unorthodox proposals. Parsons was an adamant champion of racial integration. His radical proposal for an immediate and total racial integration of the army was dismissed as ludicrous and he was advised to focus on less controversial affairs.\n\nHe took up work commanding various National Guards before being sent to Fort Meade, Maryland, where he established a tank school and began to promote new theories about armoured warfare that he had learned from studying the Weltkrieg and the military of the Union of Britain. His subsequent recommendation to the U.S Army was to establish dedicated tank divisions who could punch through enemy defences at lightning speed, going far and beyond any scale of armoured warfare that had been seen before. Tank units were normally only the size of a regiment, but Parsons called for the establishment of six entire divisions as the optimal fighting force. This was quietly ignored, much like his integration proposals. By the time of the American Civil War, Parsons knew well and truly which side he was on. Having been appointed in 1936 to lead the 6th Infantry Division in Illinois, which was then in reserve, Parsons presented his credentials to Provisional Government in Chicago, which immediately made great use of his vigorous political commitment and his revolutionary military doctrines."
