As the Duke had no children the question of who will succeed him as the Carlist claimant has arisen. Following the Duke's death, King Alfonso XIII has become the most senior male descendant of Charles IV and so in theory should also now be the head of the Carlist branch of the Borbón dynasty.\n\nVery few things in life are ever that simple however, and only a fraction of Carlist supporters have accepted Alfonso's position as the legitimate king, with the rest disqualifying him for a wide range of reasons including the alleged treason of his ancestors and even simply on the grounds of viewing him as being unfit to rule based off his weak leadership and previous deposition.\n\nThe majority of supporters of the Carlist cause have decided to instead support the claim of Javier de Borbón-Parma, declaring him King Javier I of Spain. While it is hoped that in time the Carlists may be able to slowly be convinced to begin to instead support the legitimate claim of Alfonso, it seems unlikely Carlist opposition to the king will end any time soon."

This hope was shattered today when Javier, having recently arrived in Spain from Naples, gave a speech to a crowd of Carlist supporters openly calling for his 'restoration' to the Spanish throne and the deposition of the 'false king Alfonso'.\n\nThis clear act of treason has left many within the government fearful of the lengths his supporters will go to enforce this demand, some going as far as predicting that the only remaining outcome will be civil war breaking out in the nation. It is clear that this monarchical upstart must be quickly nipped in the bud if Spain is to survive as a nation, and a decision must now be made as to how to handle the Duke."

Yesterday, Joaquin Maurín Juliá, a leader in the movement made a speech entitled 'My Heroes' in which he stated that the CNT will attempt to organise all laid off workers in an effort to save the country's economy and return jobs back to the people of Spain. With thousands of unemployed workers across the nation, it is no surprise that speeches like this have resulted in droves of new trade union members committed to the CNT's cause.\n\nFurther government inaction will clearly lead to the group becoming more and more emboldened, the threat the syndicalists pose must be dealt with as urgently as possible. The obvious solution would be to outlaw the organisation to prevent the further expansion of syndicalist support, but a much harsher crackdown may be more effective in ridding us of them at the expense of inflaming further tensions. Alternatively, we could tacitly support this latest initiative, as after all we all benefit from Spanish workers returning to their jobs, and by doing so we may be able to ultimately coopt much of the support they stand to gain through it."

 sprd.16.d: "When the police arrived at the regional headquarters of the CNT in Madrid, all that was found was an abandoned building with signs that the occupants had left in a hurry. Units sent to other headquarters across the country have returned similar reports, with one unit seemingly being sent to an office building completely unrelated to any trade union organisation. It seems obvious that not only were the syndicalists tipped off about the impending arrests, but the police force itself has either been infiltrated by syndicalist agents or it has been sabotaged by members sympathetic to the cause of the socialist agitators. With no further leads to go on as to the location of the leadership of CNT-FAI, it appears that any attempt to arrest them must be put on hold for now."

 sprd.17.t: "전국노동총연맹 해체"
 sprd.17.d: "When members of the armed forces arrived at the regional headquarters of the CNT in Madrid, all that was found was an abandoned building with signs that the occupants had left in a hurry. Units sent to other parts of Spain's cities have had some success, albeit still limited, with some lower ranking members of trade unions having been found and forcefully detained. While the leadership of these unions and most of the membership have managed to escape the wrath of the army, the sheer scope of this operation will likely deter the less dedicated members from organising further, hopefully buying us valuable time to prepare for further confrontations when they do re-emerge from hiding."
 sprd.17.a: "As expected, a bit of force was all that was needed."
 sprd.18.t: "CNT-FAI Begin Their Workers Initiative"
 sprd.18.d: "With the tacit support of the central government, or more accurately its lack of opposition, the CNT-FAI have begun to implement their proposed initiative of getting Spain's unemployed workers back on their feet with the beginnings of a fresh series of infrastructure projects done alongside members of local governments across Spain. While this genuinely seems to the benefit of everyone, it is incredibly unlikely that there is no catch, although only time will truly tell what will come from this endeavour."
 sprd.18.a: "이 상황을 계속해서 주시하도록."
 sprd.19.t: "남부까지 확장한 전국노동총연맹!"
 sprd.19.d: "Following on from their successful infrastructure projects, the CNT-FAI have announced that they have begun work on a further series of public projects and mining operations along the southern coast. Organised in a communal system, these operations are loosely controlled from their headquarters in a small town called Agua Amarga. While once again it seems unlikely there is no catch, some in the government have begun to genuinely question if these trade unions actually are just an overall benefit to the Spanish people instead of just rambunctious revolutionaries."
 sprd.19.a: "Maybe we can work together for a better future."
 sprd.20.t: "사회주의 노동의 과실"
 sprd.20.d: "The CNT-FAI's operations around Agua Amarga have begun to reach their conclusion, with the opening of many new mines and dozens of both new and old roads made fit for public use. While the impacts of these economic initiatives have yet to have a significant effect on the greater Spanish economy, the local communities of the region are arguably now in a better state than before the economic crash. It seems that cooperation with the trade unions has been mutually beneficial for all, and barring any further disasters this uneasy partnership may be enough to help Spain get back on its feet in the long term."
 sprd.20.a: "Hopefully the nation has now moved past the worst of its troubles."

 sprd.21.d: "This morning a member of King Alfonso's staff found His Majesty unconscious in bed after noticing that the King had seemingly not awoken at his usual time. Doctors on site in the palace were immediately called in to assess the situation, and have concluded that Alfonso must have suffered a stroke in the early hours of the morning. At this current stage, it is hard to gauge the severity of his condition and only time will tell if he will be able to recover."

It is unknown whether or not he will ever recover from this travesty, and his son Infante Juan has been designated temporary regent while his father continues to be incapacitated. The news of the king's stroke has quickly spread like wildfire, and the malcontents of the nation have quickly jumped upon it to call for a general election to allow the people to decide the future of both the monarchy, and Spain itself."

 sprd.25.d: "When elections were called with an explicit ban on candidates aligned with socialist or Carlist groups, some opposition from these groups was of course expected. What was however not expected was the mass outbreak of violence in cities across the nation, with both the Carlists and the CNT-FAI seemingly behind anti-government riots in protest of the state's attempt to disenfranchise these political extremists. It is hard to see how an election can be carried out in these conditions, but cancelling it now may entice even the moderates in the nation to oppose the government."

The terms of this treaty has laid out plans for military cooperation between the two nations, a motion to discuss proposals to solve the dispute over Olivenza, and a mutually beneficial trade agreement for both parties.

Carlist political organisations are taking over state authorities, the rural clergy are mobilising the masses, and the pretender has flown to Burgos to proclaim the beginning of a Second Reconquista to reclaim Spain for a truly Catholic Dynasty.\n\nSpain is headed for a brutal civil war..."

Much of the countryside lies in ruins, and order has not completely been restored, but the [SPA.GetAdjective] government announced that the anarchist and syndicalist threats had finally been dealt with and would be unlikely to rise again anytime soon. This is a triumph for King Alfonso XIII, though the king is unlikely to know of it, having fallen into a coma shortly before the civil war broke out. Despite all attempts to bring about stability in 1936, it seems the Kingdom had not planned well ahead. The question of the republic is still widespread among the people and what is to be done about the monarchy has become a key point of discussion. Regardless, our enemies should be unable to rise up again anytime soon."

 sprc.122.t: "Victory, No Matter the Cost"
 sprc.122.d: "The ongoing war has been hell for the entire population of Spain, and nowhere is this felt more than with our civilian population. As this war has dragged on, the repression conducted by our soldiers against Spain's people has slowly become more and more brutal. With enemy troops often disguising themselves as civilians in an effort to conduct ambushes, our men have begun to pre-emptively fire upon suspected traitors, despite the risk to actual civilians this has brought. \n\nWhile promises can be made to prosecute these soldiers after the war, it seems unlikely that any punishment will ever be handed out. The only hope for the civilian population of Spain is a swift end to this war, and with it a swift end to this needless terror."

Now that Spain is truly united, we must take our first steps into this new era with our fellow socialists. The country has suffered much under Alfonso's reign and it is time to right the wrongs he caused. Our first step will be to start the Congress of Iberian Socialists to decide the direction of the revolution in Spain. While the CNT-FAI led the revolutionary war effort, this victory has been won through the combined effort of the entire Popular Front, especially that of PSOE and moderate republicans who have now ingrained themselves with the people of the nation, and they will be vital to reconstruction effort."

 sprc.306.d: "Following King Alfonso's stroke and subsequent coma, his son Infante Juan has taken over his functions as the state's regent. While most of the power in their regime is held by Prime Minister Gil-Robles, many duties are still carried out by Juan and his presence has been a beacon of stability for their government. In order to strike terror into the heart of the regime, two Carlist agents have managed to infiltrate the prince's guards and will soon make an attempt on his life.\n\nThere are of course those in the Carlist movement who disapprove of this assassination, both among those who like Juan despite his family's betrayals of Spain and those who do not think it is right to kill a royal no matter the situation. Unfortunately this war must be won no matter the cost, and now we simply must wait for news of the outcome."
 sprc.306.a: "요원에게 행운을 빌지."
 sprc.307.t: "암살 실패!"
 sprc.307.d: "News of our failure has quickly spread across the nation, Infante Juan has survived the attempt made on his life. It appears that the Alfonsist regime had discovered the infiltration of Juan's personal security, and when plans began to be set in motion both of the Carlist agents were immediately arrested and promptly executed without trial by the regime. With how quickly this plot was discovered, the chance of any further assassination attempts succeeding at this stage is virtually nil. It seems that this avenue of approach must be abandoned for now."
 sprc.307.a: "Who signed off on this flawed plan anyway?"
 sprc.308.t: "후안 왕태자를 향한 카를로스파의 음모"
 sprc.308.d: "Through the righteous efforts of the security forces, a Carlist plot to assassinate Infante Juan has been quickly discovered and foiled as soon as these traitors attempted to launch their scheme. It appears that the prince's guard had been infiltrated by those sympathetic to the Carlist cause, with communications between two of the most recent recruits and their traitorous leadership having been intercepted.\n\nAfter a quick arrest of these imposters, both were put to death for treason against the state and security services have immediately launched investigations to weed out any potential further spies. Security around the prince has been greatly stepped up, but it seems unlikely that any further attempts will be made on his life once news of how quickly this plot has failed. "
 sprc.308.a: "이 뱀 같은 새끼들은 언제쯤이 되어서야 조용해질까?"
 sprc.309.t: "암살당한 왕태자!"
 sprc.309.d: "The people of Spain have woken this morning to the news of the death of Infante Juan, with knowledge of it having begun to spread before the Carlist leadership was even directly informed. Having infiltrated the prince's guard, the two agents were presented with an opportunity to plant a bomb along a path that the prince was known to regularly walk through as part of his daily routine. It appears that the bomb detonated earlier than expected, but ultimately it was enough to end the prince's life.\n\nIt has unfortunately not been entirely good news, with one of the agents having been caught by security services of the regime and quickly put to death as retribution for the killing. Ultimately though, this assassination has thrown the Alfonsist regime into chaos with soldiers already beginning to see their cause as hopeless and attempts being made by the military to seize control to maintain order."
 sprc.309.a: "We will see Javier crowned yet!"
 sprc.310.t: "왕태자의 사망!"
 sprc.310.d: "Infante Juan, crown prince and regent, has been brutally murdered by Carlist agents seeking to destabilise the nation. These snakes posed as members of the prince's guard, allowing them to get close enough to plant a bomb to assassinate Juan with. In the chaos, at least one of these murderers was captured by security forces who quickly put them to death, but it appears that any others involved in the plot have managed to flee back to their masters.\n\nWith the death of Juan, the nation is left without a regent and due to his brother Jaime's deafness many question the future of the monarchy. This has also caused complete disarray in the government, with many calling for the ousting of Gil-Robles Quiñones for this sinister plot being able to flourish without his knowledge, and it seems that a military coup led by Emilio Mola may be brewing. The future of the nation has now been left balancing on a cliff's edge."

This news is of course welcomed by all righteous revolutionaries, not only has a reactionary royal been killed, but the regime itself has been thrown into complete disarray as a result. Rumours are swirling of a military coup against the remaining government, and their soldiers are allegedly already beginning to desert their army in mass.

The status of the Spanish monarchy has often been a source of great instability within the nation, and this has never been more true than under Spain's \"twice-crowned\" king. Born with the full name Alfonso León Fernando María Jaime Isidro Pascual Antonio de Borbón y Habsburgo-Lorena, he became King of Spain for the first time from the day of his birth, given his father Alfonso VII had died a year earlier from dysentery. His mother, Maria Christina of Austria served as regent until Alfonso's ascension to the throne in 1902 on his 16th birthday.\n\nIn 1906, he married Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg which while initially successful, was strained following the birth of their sons Alfonso and Gonzalo of which both inherited haemophilia, carried by the Queen. From 1914 onwards, King Alfonso had several mistresses and fathered many illegitimate children distancing himself from his wife. His involvement in explicit productions and his extramarital affairs led to him gaining the title of \"the playboy king\", deeply undermining his reputation.\n\nFor his active role in the Rif War of the 1920s, he gained the title of \"El Africano\" (\"the African\") wishing for Spain to reclaim its place in the world by colonising Africa, having lost most of its colonies in 1898 to the United States. However, the devastating defeat at the Battle of the Annual in 1921 largely discredited Alfonso given Alfonso's known involvement in the war and his disregard for the soldiers fighting there. When asked about the battle's outcome, he replied that \"chicken meat is cheap\" as he continued his game of golf.\n\nIn 1923, with the government's credibility diminishing rapidly, especially due to the Rif War, Captain General Miguel Primo de Rivera launched a coup installing a military government. Fortunately for Alfonso, this kept his position secure while also resulting in a miraculous period of economic growth. Within just a decade however, the turn towards stagnation would see de Rivera's regime fall and a new republic declared. While the short lived republic would soon be overthrown by General José Sanjurjo and the monarchy restored, even the King's supporters have begun to worry this \"borrowed time\" will soon finally run dry."

 sprc.500.d: "With the full collapse of the Alfonsist Kingdom of Spain in the Spanish Mainland, some parts of their government and army had hoped that they could escape to the Spanish colonies in North Africa, and establish a government-in-exile like the one in Algiers. Regardless of how unlikely such a project would have been to succeed, considering the vast differences between the Spanish and French colonial empires, they never got a chance to even try. The colonial administration of Spanish Africa decided to preempt any attempts of turning their small territories into a machine with the sole purpose to reconquer Spain, by appealing to the Carlist government still holding out against the Red Menace. We were just informed that the colonies have chosen to recognise our government as the sole legitimate government of Spain, and fully submit to us."

As the city will certainly fall under the control of Syndicalist rebels, investing in an expansion of the steelworks there will greatly aid their potential industrial capacity."
 SPA_factory_sabotage: "Sabotage the Factories of Madrid"
 SPA_factory_sabotage_desc: "Despite Madrid being the heart of the Kingdom of Spain, many within the city also wish to see the end of the regime. With the aid of factory workers loyal to the socialist cause, we can organise a coordinated campaign of industrial sabotage as a prelude to the revolutionary uprising, preventing the use of any of Madrid's factories by forces loyal to the King."
 SPA_focus_carlist: "카를로스파의 정의로운 대의"
 SPA_focus_carlist_desc: "The failure of the Second Republic showed the peoples of Spain that the country will fall apart without the guidance of a strong monarch. These past four years of turmoil have also shown us that Alfonso's incompetence would result in him failing to get people drunk in a brewery, let alone guide them through crisis. We should instead offer our backing to the Carlist claimant to the throne, and hope that a more legitimate Spanish King will lead our nation forward."
 SPA_northern_industry: "스페인 북부의 산업 역량 확장"
 SPA_northern_industry_desc: "For centuries the stronghold of the Carlist movement has been in the north of Spain. In the event of a civil war, there is no doubt that these territories will remain loyal to the Carlist cause, and any industrial investments in these regions are bound to end up in the hands of their troops."
 SPA_defend_burgos: "부르고스 요새"
 SPA_defend_burgos_desc: "Burgos has been firmly established as the metaphorical stronghold of the Carlist movement, with the government having already lost de facto control of the city. If the Carlist movement is to succeed, Burgos must be transformed into a much less metaphorical stronghold. Defensive positions should be established throughout the city, and even the old castle can be home to anti-air batteries to ensure Javier's ultimate triumph."
 SPA_kings_proclamation: "진정한 국왕 선포"
 SPA_kings_proclamation_desc: "No matter who or what they support, it is always painful for the blood of Spaniards to be spilled. While it seems unlikely at this stage that Javier can be peacefully restored to the throne, a proclamation from the true king declaring the end of Alfonso's reign and urging a peaceful transfer of power may convince some Alfonsists to lay down their arms and help save some Spanish lives from being needlessly lost."
 SPA_portuguese_aid: "이베리아 형제들의 지원"
 SPA_portuguese_aid_desc: "No matter how much we fight or bicker, the peoples of Spain and Portugal are truly brothers and sisters. While the Portuguese government does not yet wish to officially recognise Javier as the king of Spain, those in charge of the Portuguese regime and many subjects of its realm wish to aid the rightful Carlist cause. If we petition our Portuguese friends for support, there is no doubt that they will provide to us as much as they possibly can."
 SPA_rights_spanish: "스페인인의 권리 회복"
 SPA_rights_spanish_desc: "Since Primo de Rivera's coup in 1923, the Spanish Constitution has remained suspended, which evidently has not mended the rifts in Spanish society as shown by the outbreak of civil war. Therefore the Spanish Constitution will be restored and the fundamental rights of the Spanish will be recognised, so long as the exercise of these rights does not go against the spiritual, national and social unity of Spain."
 SPA_jan: "Rally the JAN"
 SPA_jan_desc: "The Juventudes de Acción Nacional are the youth wing of our party and have captured the boundless energy hidden within the Spanish youth, which is far different to the desolate and enervating scepticism of our defeatists and intellectuals. The JAN faithfully came to the aid of Spain during the civil war by recruiting many volunteers for our holy cause. Now that the war is over, the JAN should be expanded and provide a home for all of our society's young."
 SPA_spanish_man: "새로운 스페인 국민"
 SPA_spanish_man_desc: "98년 무정부주의 세대와 그들의 사상은 슬프고 거칠고 비정한 스페인 젊은이들을 만들어냈습니다. 우리는 패배주의로 가득 차 있고 희망이 없는 현재와는 달리 진정성 있고 행복하며 낙관적인 스페인의 젊은이들을 새로운 인간으로 만들어야 합니다."
 SPA_organic_democracy: "유기적 민주주의"
 SPA_organic_democracy_desc: "스페인 민주주의는 자유주의, 의회주의, 정당제, 보통 선거권과 같은 사소한 것보단 가족이나 지방 자치 단체와 같은 전통적이고 자연스러운 사회 제도에 기반을 두어 정당 정치로 만들어지는 부패로부터 스페인 국민을 지킬 수 있게 되었습니다. 이제 양원제가 자리 잡을 것이고 입법권은 보통 선거권에 의해 선출된 의회와 조직화한 사회적 이익을 대표하는 상원에 의해 행사될 것입니다."
 SPA_national_catholicism: "가톨릭 국교화"
 SPA_national_catholicism_desc: "가톨릭 교회의 규칙과 가르침은 스페인 법의 필수적인 부분이 될 것입니다. 교회는 법을 만드는 데 강대한 영향력을 가질 것이며, [SPK.getleader]는 교회가 보호받을 수 있도록 할 것입니다."

 SPA_ally_jon_desc: "국민생디칼리슴 공세평의회는 폭력에 대한 경외심이나 강한 가톨릭적 성격과 같이 존경할 만한 특성을 많이 가지고 있습니다. 그들의 광신주의는 몰라에게 깊은 인상을 주었고 이미 국민생디칼리슴 공세평의회를 애국연합에 통합하기 위한 논의가 시작되었습니다. 우리의 지도하에 그들의 국민생디칼리슴적 안건들은 스페인 국가의 초석이 될 수 있으며 사회 모든 부분에 우리가 살아가는 목적을 심어주는 역할을 할 수 있습니다,"
 SPA_abolish_parties: "코르테스 조합화"
 SPA_abolish_parties_desc: "조합주의 모델에 따라 코르테스는 폐쇄되고 국가평의회가 그 자리를 대신하게 될 것입니다. 국민들의 생활 그 자체의 변화를 만들고 조합적이고 권위주의적인 국가를 만들 수있는 유익한 변화 과정이 시작될 것입니다. 현재 형태의 의회 시스템은 실패한 것이기에 우린 새로운 스페인을 건설하기 위해 국가 최고 평의회를 만들 것입니다."
 SPA_national_revolution: "국민혁명"
 SPA_national_revolution_desc: "애국연합은 이전의 실패한 정권의 흔적을 모두 쓸어버리고 새로운 질서를 가져올 것입니다. 이를 위해선 대중과 국가의 직접적이고 적극적이며 전투적인 행동을 통한 국민혁명이 필요합니다. 우리의 삶은 전쟁터와 같고 우리는 그 삶 속에서 무기를 쥔 민병대와 같습니다. 무너지고 병들어 문들어진 우리 조국 스페인를 재건하기 위해선 우린 조국에 대한 순수한 봉사와 희생의 정신으로 살아야만합니다."

 SPA_resource_extraction: "천연자원 추출"

 SPA_military_investments: "군사적 부문 투자"

 SPA_comercial_investment: "상업 보조금"
 SPA_comercial_investment_desc: "The many private companies that are at the heart of the Spanish economy have been torn apart and left in ruins following both Black Monday and the Civil War.

 SPA_ley_general_educacion: "일반교육법"
 SPA_ley_general_educacion_desc: "In order to improve the quality of education for Spaniards across the country, a new law has been passed.

 SPA_expand_real_academia: "왕립학회 확장"
 SPA_expand_real_academia_desc: "The Royal Academies are the highest education schools within Spain. Many often specialise in one particular field or connected fields, such as science, medicine, history, language and so on. We should make sure that they get the funding needed to provide education for Spain."
 SPA_industrial_nationalisation: "산업 국유화"
 SPA_industrial_nationalisation_desc: "While our government has often supported free market industrial endeavours, the nationalisation of key industry during this turbulent time of reconstruction may significantly aid the rebuilding process and should be considered. The question of if and how we should return the industry to the original owners after this period of nationalisation is simply one for a future time, preferably far enough that it no longer matters."
 SPA_create_ini: "국립산업연구소"
 SPA_create_ini_desc: "The Instituto Nacional de Industria or National Institute of Industry, is a state run corporation created to help develop the Spanish economy and improve the state's self-sufficiency."
 SPA_modern_agriculture: "현대적 농업"
 SPA_modern_agriculture_desc: "The many small farm estates of the countryside have struggled during the recent troubles we have faced, as they have been unable to adopt new agricultural technologies and methods of cultivation. We should subsidise the import of modern agricultural equipment to jump start this process."
 SPA_military_factories: "군수산업 확장"
 SPA_military_factories_desc: "War will likely come to Spain in the future. The godless Commune of France sits just across the Pyrenees after all. Thus in order to prepare for that future war, we should build new military factories."
 SPA_labour_charter: "노동 헌장"
 SPA_labour_charter_desc: "The state has announced the creation of a Labour Charter. This charter helps protect the realm's subjects from godless Syndicalism by providing a conservative welfare programme and recognising some worker's rights, nipping the growth of further Syndicalism in the bud."
 SPA_catholic_trade_unions: "가톨릭 노동조합"
 SPA_catholic_trade_unions_desc: "불행하게도 노동조합은 현대 경제에서 상당히 중요합니다. 하지만 그들을 소외시키는 대신에 우리는 가톨릭 노동조합을 장려해야 합니다. 이것은 우리가 그들에 대한 더 큰 통제권을 줄 뿐만 아니라 신을 믿지 않는 생디칼리스트주의자들의 편을 든 노동조합을 우리편으로 급진화하는 데 도움을 줄 것입니다."

 SPA_preservation_of_order: "질서유지"
 SPA_preservation_of_order_desc: "A loyal army is fundamental to maintaining order in the state. Without one, anarchy and chaos is sure to prevail against order, and so we must therefore take steps to ensure and encourage loyalty in the army."
 SPA_artillery_effort: "현대군을 위한 현대식 총포"
 SPA_artillery_effort_desc: "The world is quickly moving past the age of bolt action and small capacity semi-automatic rifles, and yet many of our frontline infantry are still equipped with this old fashioned equipment.

 SPA_guardia_civil: "국가헌병대"

 SPA_emergency_factories_desc: "In times of peace we can afford to enforce safety standards and protections in our factories, but we no longer have this luxury.

 SPA_defenders_of_realm_desc: "The battles that decide our future will not be fought in the open fields, but in the centre of great cities and sprawling urban landscapes.

 SPA_army_of_maneuver: "기동군"
 SPA_army_of_maneuver_desc: "It is no longer the Weltkrieg, wars cannot be easily won by simply having a large cannon. Motorised divisions, tank brigades, and fast moving infantry are key to victory, and so they will be key to the armies of Spain."
 SPA_mechanized_effort: "스페인 자동차 산업"
 SPA_mechanized_effort_desc: "We should look at modernising the Automotive industry of the Spanish Army. Mechanised warfare will require better trucks and automobiles, which will help in getting supplies to our troops as well as increasing the mobility of our soldiers."
 SPA_weltrieg_lessons: "기갑전 전술"
 SPA_weltrieg_lessons_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed to everybody the potential use of tanks. Combined with motorised or mechanised support, tanks can excel at the purpose they were designed to achieve; to catch the enemy by surprise. Unlike in the Weltkrieg, where tanks were massive and vulnerable targets, a much more mobile approach is needed."
 SPA_navarran_lancers: "나바라 창기병대"
 SPA_navarran_lancers_desc: "During the first Carlist War, the lancers from Navarra were some of the best cavalry troops that the armies had. It therefore seems fitting to revive this legacy with our tank brigades. They shall be our elite troops, and the tip of the spear of the Spanish Army."
 SPA_tank_shipments: "독일제 전차 지원 요청"
 SPA_tank_shipments_desc: "If we are to win this ongoing war, we will need as many tanks as possible deployed to the battlefield. While they may not be the highest quality, the Germans still have a large amount of old tanks rusting away in their stockpiles. By petitioning Berlin, we may be able to quickly get a sizable amount of these tanks delivered, allowing us to quickly send them to the frontlines."
 SPA_a_modern_army: "현대식 육군"
 SPA_a_modern_army_desc: "It was not long ago that our army was hopelessly outdated, barely advancing since the Napoleonic Wars. Now with our recent reforms and technological advancements the Spanish army can no longer be discounted as an outdated relic, being now a modern army that may soon become the premier army of Europe."
 SPA_armada_espanola: "스페인 해군"
 SPA_armada_espanola_desc: "During the Spanish golden age, the Spanish Armada was the greatest fleet in the world. Its ship sailed the oceans and we ruled the waves. We should modernise our fleet and restore our navy to its former glory."
 SPA_upgrade_dockyards: "Dirección General de la Marina Mercante"
 SPA_upgrade_dockyards_desc: "The Spanish Navy was famous for its merchants, Spanish galleons filled with gold and other goods from the Americas would flow back daily to the mainland. We should rekindle our mercantile spirit and build a modern merchant marine for the Spanish Navy."

 SPA_coast_guard_desc: "Currently Spain lacks any form of dedicated coast guard force, with most of the duties being handled by the Guardia Civil until recently.

 SPA_protect_our_colonies_desc: "The overseas colonies that we still hold are of vital interest to Spain and we should use our navy to protect the coast of our colonies from all attackers. However in case that is not viable, several well placed coastal forts and batteries shall do the job."

 SPA_academia_basica_del_aire: "기본 항공학교"
 SPA_academia_basica_del_aire_desc: "Modern wars are fought not only on the land and across the seas, but also in the skies. Modern air doctrines must be instilled into our pilots, and state of the art planes must be built if we expect to be victorious in our battles."
 SPA_upgrade_air_ports: "핵심 항공사 국유화"
 SPA_upgrade_air_ports_desc: "The infrastructure needed to support a large air force does not need to be built completely from the ground up.

 SPA_new_pilots: "새로운 조종사 훈련"
 SPA_new_pilots_desc: "Most of our current air force is made up of eager volunteers and former pilots of civilian aircraft, with little to no knowledge of military aviation. It is therefore imperative that these recruits receive proper training before they are deployed in the skies, as their experience will hopefully give us the edge we need over our rivals."
 SPA_aviation_industry: "항공 산업 지원"
 SPA_aviation_industry_desc: "Spanish aircraft manufacturers have been stunted by the turbulence that has plagued the country for several years.

 SPA_foreign_airplanes: "해외 항공기 구매"
 SPA_foreign_airplanes_desc: "Our country is not really in the position to manufacture an air force. For this reason, we must purchase old planes from abroad to help kickstart the Spanish Air Force. The air war is likely to become of greater importance as the Weltkrieg had suggested decades ago."
 SPA_army_air_support: "육군 항공 지원"
 SPA_army_air_support_desc: "The easiest enemy to fight is one who has already been killed by a bombing run before the battle begins, and so our air force should be focused on producing planes focused on battlefield support missions and bombing efforts to support our troops in their endeavours."

 SPA_german_mining_projects: "German Mining Projects"
 SPA_german_mining_projects_desc: "The German war machine never ceases its thirst for more resources to produce further armaments. Germany has therefore proposed allowing German led mining projects in our country, to aid in our resource extraction attempts and to hopefully be a mutually beneficial arrangement for us both."
 SPA_mitteleuropa: "대독 무역협정 갱신"
 SPA_mitteleuropa_desc: "Trade with Germany has greatly diminished since the turmoil of Black Monday hit both our countries. Now that we are properly aligned with the Germans, it is time to renew trade between us, which will greatly aid our country's economic growth."

 SPA_lease_gibraltar_desc: "While we may officially be neutral in the ongoing conflict between Germany and its Syndicalist rivals, it does not mean we do not wish for a German victory over the godless socialists. The Strait of Gibraltar is vital to controlling the Mediterranean during this war, and by temporarily leasing Gibraltar to the Germans we can help ensure their control over the sea while netting ourselves a tidy sum in the process."
 SPA_bounties_of_neutrality: "중립국의 박애"
 SPA_bounties_of_neutrality_desc: "War is good for business, and even better when you're not involved in it. By sitting on the sidelines of any ongoing conflicts in the world, we are able to conduct trade regardless of allegiances and thus we stand to greatly profit from these conflicts."
 SPA_increased_volunteers: "비공식적인 개입 정책"
 SPA_increased_volunteers_desc: "Just because we are officially neutral, it does not mean that our private citizens must also be neutral. Many in our country still wish to fight in conflicts overseas, and it would be wrong to stop them from doing so. It is simply coincidental that many of these volunteers happen to be part of our military and are armed with the latest equipment of our armed forces."
 SPA_influx_of_refugees: "난민 유입"
 SPA_influx_of_refugees_desc: "Being a neutral country in Europe during this great war has resulted in an influx of refugees fleeing their homes and arriving in Spain to be free of conflict.

 SPA_putting_refugees_to_work_desc: "The Spanish state is not a charity organisation, if the refugees we have received wish to stay they must make themselves useful.

The peoples of each nation have had to witness and experience their nation's destruction by hostile foreign agitators and internal saboteurs, and in recognition of this bond representatives from the two states have met today in Spain to formulate a treaty between them. The main terms of this treaty lay out a series of trade agreements between both nations, and the establishment of Spanish military aid to assist the Italian cause. Following the end of this meeting, a statement from [ROOT.GetLeader] was read out declaring this agreement to be simply the starting point of the shared future of Spanish-Italian cooperation, and that [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] will be committed to strengthening the bonds that hold their peoples together."

 sprf.11.d: "Despite [FROM.GetNameDef]'s official stance of neutrality in regards to the ongoing war in Europe, it is obvious to many in Spain that an Internationale victory would lead to a very precarious future for their nation. In order to help tip the balance of the war against the Syndicalists, Spain has proposed a temporary lease of Gibraltar as a German naval base for the duration of the war. Not only would control of Gibraltar provide a fortified position in the Mediterranean, but it would also grant us control over the strait and allow us to easily block any enemy ships from entering the Mediterranean. In exchange, Spain simply requests a simple monetary transfer as compensation and to pay for any post-war reconstruction that may be needed after our lease expires."

Shall we extend God Almighty judgment on the corrupters of Spain, no matter how well they hide; or should we show them a merciful hand to take them to the path of the righteous?"
 sprc.3.socialists: "The last vestiges of reactionary resistance have surrendered, faced with the overwhelming truth that there is no way out of the city.

The massive patrimony of centuries of art and treasures is finally available to everyone, and in doing so, we have discovered that the decadence of Alfonso XIII is far deeper than expected, as his immense collection of obscene content attests.

Most seats are occupied by delegates from either the CNT-FAI or the PSOE, who are both attempting to persuade the remainder of the delegates to support their bid for leadership.\n\nWhile the CNT-FAI is in a strong position due to their revolutionary zeal and the early role they provided in leading the revolution to victory, the PSOE has been able to appeal to a broader support base due to promising stable leadership and moderation.

The eruption of the civil war has only served to deepen the rift even further with an increasing number of clashes between the two wings over policy implementation. Therefore, a party congress has been called to put an end to party disunity and to determine the direction the party should take.\n\nThe reigning radical wing of the party is lead by José Maria Gil-Robles who appeals mainly to the politically influential radical right with his staunch catholicism and uncompromising attitude towards the enemies of Spain. He is challenged by José Calvo Sotelo, representing the moderate wing and defending the need for Parliament and suffrage under a responsible regime, who appeals to those disillusioned by the increasingly radical direction the party has taken. Although many expect Gil-Robles to retain party leadership, the amount of support Sotelo has received comes as a surprise and could be enough to propel him into national leadership."

While initially starting out as a jurist, having graduated with a law degree from the University of Zaragoza and later a doctorate from Central University, José Calvo Sotelo soon shifted his focus towards heavy involvement in Spanish politics. Beginning his political career as part of the Maurism movement, he would eventually end up being briefly both a deputy and the Civil Governor of Valencia.\n\nFollowing the establishment of Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, Sotelo quickly found himself rising through the ranks through his committed support to de Rivera's leadership, eventually becoming the Minister of Finance. The collapse of Rivera's first regime led to his brief self imposed exile to Portugal, but with the swift end of the Second Republic Sotelo found himself not only back in government but in a much higher position than before.\n\nAfter the death of de Rivera many expected Sotelo to potentially succeed the late Prime Minister, but any hopes of this were quickly scuppered in the wake of his hospitalisation following an attempt on his life by a group of radical socialists aligned with the CNT. In the aftermath of his swift recovery Sotelo's position within the party remained strong, and with the government's victory in the civil war he has found himself elected as its new leader to hopefully guide Spain to a new period of prosperity and peace."

The chaos that arose after the collapse of the Spanish economy and the incapacitation of King Alfonso led to many wishing for a strong leader to guide Spain out of the chaos, and it is therefore little surprise that these conditions have facilitated the rise of Marshal Emilio Mola Vidal to power.\n\nBeing born in Spanish Cuba to a Cuban mother and a Spanish father, his family would ultimately move back to mainland Spain after the nation's defeat by American forces finalised Cuban independence. His military career for the Spanish state began at the Toledo Infantry Academy, with him ultimately distinguishing himself in Morocco and ending up one of the premier generals of de Rivera's regime and its Director-General of Security.\n\nDespite having no direct involvement in General Sanjurjo's coup which ended the Second Republic, Mola quickly found himself rewarded by the restored regime with a promotion to Field Marshal regardless. This new position has allowed Mola to command great respect within Spain's armed forces, even among those who disagree with his political stances.\n\nNow colloquially referred to as 'El Caudillo', both by his enemies and his allies alike, Mola and his cabinet make no secret of their disdain for the democratic system of the Second Spanish Republic. It is their belief that for Spain to survive, it must be led by a one party state with a strong leader to guide it forward, and only time will tell if Mola is truly that leader."
