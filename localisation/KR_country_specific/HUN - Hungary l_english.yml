At the start of the Weltkrieg, he was a captain serving on the Serbian Front until transferring to Galicia to fight in the bloody Carpathian winter battles and the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive. He received the Military Merit Cross in 1915, briefly transferring to the War Ministry in Vienna and Honvéd Ministry in Budapest until 1916, and once more in 1918. By the end of the war, he was a colonel, and he spent the better part of the 1920s publishing several volumes analysing the Serbian and Romanian Campaigns for the armed forces. As a result, not only is he known as a prolific writer in military circles, but also as a forward-thinking officer embracing new technologies (\"Mobility, speed, and surprise will take on a new meaning in the war of the future\") with great concern for the lives of the common soldiery. As such, since becoming a general in 1934, he is well-respected as a humanitarian, a rare sight in the Austro-Hungarian armed forces.\n\n\"When it comes to matters of national defence, I see no races or denominations, only good and bad soldiers.\""

By the end of the war, he had become a major and was promoted to colonel in 1921. After the war, he taught tactics at the Ludovika, becoming its commander in 1931.
