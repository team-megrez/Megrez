 SOV_totalist_party_long: "Kommunisticheskiy Narodno-Osvoboditelniy Front (Communist People's Liberation Front)\n§gWith his knowledge of revolutionary propaganda, Radek rallied a number of dearly-needed worker militias to the cause, earning his party a spot in the politics of the new Socialist Republic. KNOF is the most radical faction of them all, advocating primitive socialist accumulation and five-year plans to rapidly industrialise Russia and transform it into a leading socialist state.\n\nPrimitive socialist accumulation is an economic theory conceptualised by Yevgeni Preobrazhensky as an adaptation of the ideas of Karl Marx. In his view, if socialism was to triumph, the socialist sector would need to expand by realising an absolute increase in production and a relative increase in private production from one year to the next. To finance this expansion, the state would need a socialist accumulation fund for investment based on the appropiation of surplus production (Surplus value or profit) from both the state and market sectors. KNOF plans to appropiate the surplus production by taxing the peasantry, who they see as complicit with the reactionary forces. With the necessary funds, the productive forces will transition to socialism through a central planning agency. This agency will then draw up five-year plans that allow for rapid industrialisation.§!"

 SOV_syndicalist_party_long: "Profsoyuznaya Sotsialisticheskaya Partiya (Trade Union Socialist Party)\n§gUnder Kollontai and Shlyapnikov's leadership, the trade unions launched a wave of strikes across Western Russia, seizing control of Moscow and other industrial centres for the revolution. This earned the PSP a spot in the politics of the new Socialist Republic. Out of all parties, it is the most sympathetic to French syndicalism, stressing that Russia must adopt a system of industrial democracy to become a workers' state.\n\nIndustrial democracy is a concept where workers assemble to decide how to run their means of production. Kollontai seeks to expand the idea further into a system of governance and economic management. In it, workers will organise into trade unions, which will rule the cities, direct the means of production, and represent the workers as part of the All-Russian Union of Producers (VSR - Vserossiyskiy Soyuz Rabochikh), a national federation of trade unions. With industrial democracy, the workers will fulfil their role as the will of the proletariat.§!"

 SOV_radical_socialist_party_long: "Narodnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Partiya (People's Socialist Party)\n§gAs Kornilov arrived in Moscow and started his acts of brutality, Bukharin and Rykov sprung their plan into action, rallying the already-enraged populace and driving the military out of the city. They declared that a new revolution is being launched, and this time, it will not fail. As leader of the Second Revolution, the NSP is the most prominent party within the new RSR, backed by exiled Bolsheviks who returned to fight for their homeland once more. Seeking to transform Russia into a people's state, the NSP calls for proletarian humanism.\n\nProletarian humanism is a concept created by Karl Marx that argues the free worker is the central value of society, rather than private property. For the worker to be free, Marx believes that popular exploitation must end. In order for it to end, the people must be led by a dictatorship of the proletariat in class struggle against the aristocracy. Once the aristocracy is dethroned from power and popular exploitation ends, it is safe to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat. The result will be a society with class harmony, where everybody has the same social status and lives peacefully, a people's state.§!"

 SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy_desc: "Kerensky's reign and its aftermath hardly improved matters from the times of the Tsars.

 SOV_Allow_Small_Traders: "소규모 무역 허용"
 SOV_Allow_Small_Traders_desc: "In order to allow for a smoother transition to a socialist economy, a limited amount of commerce will be permitted within non-essential sectors of the economy. After all, the common man operating a small store is not that far removed from the worker on a factory floor and equating him with an industrial baron would create needless harm to the masses."
 SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan: "러시아 국가전력화위원회"
 SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan_desc: "Electrification is a central part for communism. Lenin went so far as to state that 'Communism is Soviet government plus the electrification of the whole country.'

 SOV_Mechanisation: "기계화"
 SOV_Mechanisation_desc: "The industrial revolution brought with it great advancements in productivity as factories and farmlands started to utilise machinery on a grand scale. Yet here in Russia, most labour is done by hand. In order to compete with the capitalists that oppose us at every turn, we must embrace these developments and modernise our economy accordingly."
 SOV_Khozraschyot: "경제적 회계"
 SOV_Khozraschyot_desc: "A socialist economy cannot be created overnight. One of the early transitional steps as outlined in the New Economic Policy of the Russian Socialist Republic will require that certain elements of the free market model are emulated for the time being, something that in the short term will see greater developments in light rather than heavy industries."
 SOV_Promote_Industrialisation: "산업화를 촉진"
 SOV_Promote_Industrialisation_desc: "We do not exist in a vacuum. In order to modernise our economy into a socialist model, we have to participate in the global market on some level, in order to achieve the amount of capital needed to procure the machinery and knowledge. The best way of achieving this is to establish a series of state trusts that can finance these ventures, while allowing our internal economy to stay separate from international capitalism."
 SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution: "혁명 전파"
 SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution_desc: "The revolution will not be contained within just the borders of Russia. The worker abroad must be freed from tyranny as well and it's our duty to aid them in their struggle."
 SOV_Secure_Central_Asia: "중앙아시아 확보"
 SOV_Secure_Central_Asia_desc: "Formerly part of Russia, the central Asian plains have since fallen to despotic Khans and their militant hordes. To bring socialist leadership to these lands wouldn't just be an act of self-defence on our part, but also an act of liberation of the downtrodden that live under the yoke of these warlords."
 SOV_The_Final_Battle: "최후의 결전"
 SOV_The_Final_Battle_desc: "The treaty of Brest-Litovsk handed over millions of workers to the German industrialists on a silver platter and gave them Russia's most heavily industrialised lands on top of it. It's our duty to liberate the people of the East from the German yoke once and for all."
 SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias: "도시 민병대 동원"
 SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias_desc: "The cities have been the heartland of the revolution ever since the beginning - they were its birthland. We must rally militias from the cities to serve in the revolution and allow for its spread, for if we do not, the revolution may be crushed yet again."
 SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units: "적위대"
 SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units_desc: "Many members of the Bolshevik Party are still in hiding. We must mobilise and organise these people into military formations, as we need every soldier we can get at this point if we want to survive the incoming onslaught."
 SOV_Rally_The_Defectors: "반동분자 재교육"
 SOV_Rally_The_Defectors_desc: "Many in the Russian army are dissatisfied with the status quo, which makes them perfect to recruit to the revolution.

 SOV_The_War_Effort: "조직화된 전쟁"
 SOV_The_War_Effort_desc: "We will need to organise the revolutionary war effort, as it has been a pure disaster so far. We will re-establish much of the bureaucracy and state apparatus which was destroyed in the wake of the failure of the First Civil War. "
 SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army: "새로운 붉은 군대"
 SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army_desc: "The Red Army will have to be rebuilt if we are to win this revolution. A centralised army proved itself to be a capable fighting force the first time around, and it will be a capable one the second time around too. Even so, we must be aware of the failures and mistakes of its first incarnation."
 SOV_Centralised_Command: "명령 중앙화"
 SOV_Centralised_Command_desc: "A centralised command is necessary in military combat - any alternative would just result in total disaster, something we need to avoid at all costs. Thus, we will aim to create a cohesive military chain of command, to allow for a more effective fighting force."
 SOV_Reinstate_The_Cheka: "국가반혁명대처특수위원회"
 SOV_Reinstate_The_Cheka_desc: "The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission carried out its duties with diligence. Now that socialist rule has been established, however, we face the threat of subversion from counter-revolutionaries from across the world. In order to fend off the threats both from within and from abroad we must expand the institution and modernise its methods."
 SOV_War_Communism: "전시공산주의"
 SOV_War_Communism_desc: "We must take multiple measures to win this war and to spread the revolution to Russia, however unpopular and brutal many of these may prove to be. They are necessary to win the war and improve the life of the general population in the long-term."
 SOV_The_Second_Red_Army: "두 번째 붉은 군대"
 SOV_The_Second_Red_Army_desc: "The Red Army must be rebuilt, as it was a great display of proletarian power, even if it was defeated at the end. However, the solution is to rebuild the Red Army and learn from its failure, not to reject the Red Army and the principles it was founded on."
 SOV_Reorganise_Armament_Production: "무기생산 조직화"
 SOV_Reorganise_Armament_Production_desc: "The current state of armament production is a disaster. We must reorganise the armament production and end the chaos in the production chain. Only by doing this can we guarantee that every soldier will have a gun to fight the forces of reaction."
 SOV_The_Peoples_Logistics_Corps: "인민의 보급대"
 SOV_The_Peoples_Logistics_Corps_desc: "We must properly organise our logistics. In order to do this, we will create the 'People's Logistic Corps,' which will be in charge of the supply chains, hopefully improving the current state of our logistics - in many areas, a total disaster."
 SOV_Dedicated_Artillery_Battalions: "전문적인 포병대"
 SOV_Dedicated_Artillery_Battalions_desc: "We will create independent artillery battalions, which will serve to support our troops and break the enemy lines with waves of artillery shells, preventing them from launching any effective counter-attacks."
 SOV_Local_Workshops: "지역 작업장"
 SOV_Local_Workshops_desc: "We will create local workshops all throughout the nation, to allow for local arms production, which is better suited to serve the local situation and needs than a centralised way of organising the production."
 SOV_Empower_The_Krasnaya_Gvardiya: "국가 근위대에 권한을"
 SOV_Empower_The_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_desc: "We must create a bottom-up army structure - an army which is truly representative of the revolutionary spirit. We will support the democratic election of commanders, even if it may cause some issues at times - the soldiers in the field probably know better who should command them than our leaders, far away from the situation."
 SOV_Decentralised_Structure: "지방분권된 구조"
 SOV_Decentralised_Structure_desc: "We must further decentralise the army of the revolution, giving every part of the chain considerable autonomy and preventing the higher-ups from being able to dictate to the rest of the chain what they should do and how."
 SOV_Reconnaissance_Units: "수색부대"
 SOV_Reconnaissance_Units_desc: "By creating units dedicated to reconnaissance we will always be one step ahead of the enemy. We will know what their next plan is and what we need to do to counteract it."
 SOV_Officer_Initiative: "일선장교 자율권"
 SOV_Officer_Initiative_desc: "Encouraging officers to make their own decisions autonomously will allow for better responses to sudden changes, as they are more knowledgeable about the situation on the ground than some far away higher-ups, who never visited the area properly."
 SOV_Small_Unit_Tactics: "분대전술"
 SOV_Small_Unit_Tactics_desc: "Instead of using masses of troops, using small units allows for us to be far quicker in our attacks and surprise than if we use large waves of soldiers. This will also give us more easily the element of surprise."
 SOV_Frunzes_Reform_Plan: "프룬제의 개혁안"
 SOV_Frunzes_Reform_Plan_desc: "With the revolution secured, for now, we can focus on other matters. Frunze has proposed that we should focus on improving the high command and officer training and generally improve the defence of the army against a possible invasion, a real threat, as the forces of reaction will probably try to end the revolution in the future."
 SOV_Expand_The_High_Command: "최고사령부 확장"
 SOV_Expand_The_High_Command_desc: "The high command will need to be expanded to include many of the best generals we have, who were all able to show their skill in the Second Russian Revolution. Only a high command truly including the best of the best will be able to make intelligent decisions."
 SOV_Officer_Training_Academies: "장교사관학교"
 SOV_Officer_Training_Academies_desc: "Our military academies are in many ways still a relic of the past, with most being from the time of the Tsar. We will create a series of new military academies, following the best doctrine, not the most traditional doctrine. Only this way will we create an officer corps, which is truly superior to the ones of the capitalists."
 SOV_Professional_Engineer_Corps: "전문적인 공병대"
 SOV_Professional_Engineer_Corps_desc: "Our army still lacks a proper engineer corps, at least a formalised one. We will change this situation by creating a formal engineer corps, which will be professionally trained in its craft."
 SOV_Tukhachevskiys_Reform_Plan: "투하쳅스키의 개혁안"
 SOV_Tukhachevskiys_Reform_Plan_desc: "Tukhachevskiy has proposed to use the doctrine of deep battle, which proposes the use of combined arms and overwhelming land-air attacks. Such a doctrine would make the army a true force to be reckoned with on the offensive."
 SOV_Mass_Breakthroughs: "집단 돌격"

 SOV_Establish_The_VVS: "VVS창설"
 SOV_Establish_The_VVS_desc: "The VVS (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, 'Military Air Force') is badly outdated. We use the same planes and tactics today that we did twenty years ago. By expanding our air bases and training new recruits we could change this."
 SOV_Airspace_Defence: "영공방위"
 SOV_Airspace_Defence_desc: "Nothing is more important than the defence of the airspace, as our enemies will try to utilise aircraft in every possible way to conquer our airspace and terrorise the land troops, something we will have to avoid at all costs if we want to be victorious in future encounters."
 SOV_The_ORT_System: "ORT시스템"
 SOV_The_ORT_System_desc: "Modern wars are only partially won on the battlefield. Equally important are the men and women behind desks and radios, dealing with intelligence and transmissions. We need to make their work easier."
 SOV_Nationalise_The_Aircraft_Industry: "항공산업 국유화"
 SOV_Nationalise_The_Aircraft_Industry_desc: "We have a highly modern aircraft industry, but most of it is still in private hands. We will have to nationalise this aircraft industry and integrate it into the state apparatus if we want to create a modern and strong air force."
 SOV_Aviation_Bureaus: "항공국"

 russoc.102.t: "당 내 갈등"
 russoc.102.d: "The party has come to be divided between three factions, one led by Bukharin and Rykov, one by Kollontai and Shlyapnikov and one by Radek. The first champions a path of socialism at a snail's pace, where cautious industrialisation prevents the creation of a massive state bureaucracy, preserves the Smychka at all costs and bridges the general urban-rural divide in the country.\n\nThe syndicalist faction promotes an economy managed by unions, seeing them as the best way to give workers a voice in the economy and the nation. They also are very opposed to the perceived influence of the peasants and thus strongly wish to break up the Smychka in support of the further workerisation of the party.\n\nLast but not least, the faction led by Radek supports the idea of primitive socialist accumulation - that is, to extract the peasants’ surplus value and use it towards developing the nation’s productive forces in order to transition Russia into a state ready for socialism - which, in their minds, is best accomplished through five-year plans."

 russoc.105.t: "N.N. Sukhanov's Memoirs of the Revolution"
 russoc.105.d: "For years, the course of events during the October Revolution have been a mystery to the world and the general population. The White forces and the Republic they founded made sure to paint the Bolshevik uprising in a negative light, many of the witnesses of the events died in the Civil War, and those who survived were unable to spread the word. Now that the socialist revolution has won in Russia, however, the seven volume memoirs of Nikolai N. Sukhanov, the most comprehensive account of the Revolution available, has been published in Moscow. Sukhanov, a member of the Petrograd Soviet, composed the memoirs in exile, but was unable to release them until today.\n\nThe Memoirs of the Revolution tell the story of the October Revolution from 1917 to its defeat in 1920, and destroy many of the myths which have been perpetuated about its events. For years, the fate of Leon Trotsky, one of the main leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the chief of the Red Army, was a mystery, as unlike the other revolutionaries such as Lenin, his death was never fully confirmed. Sukhanov asserts that Trotsky is dead, however - he perished in an artillery barrage at the last days of the Civil War. His account of Trotsky is a lot more flattering than street knowledge in Moscow, too - White propaganda painted Trotsky as a terrible leader who sacrificed thousands of men in failed offensives, and this perception has since become accepted fact, but Sukhanov describes him as competent and capable, if arrogant and conflicting. The exile states that Trotsky is not to blame for the Bolshevik defeat, foreign intervention and Lenin's death at Fanny Kaplan's hands is.\n\nThe Memoirs have since become commonplace in Russian elementary schools and universities as mandatory learning material for the new generation. They shall learn about the heroism of the original Bolsheviks and their struggle for the rights of the people."
 russoc.105.a: "Your sacrifice will not be in vain."
 russoc.106.t: "Farmers Begin to Burn Livestock En Masse"
 russoc.106.d: "The government's programme of mass collectivisation, seeing it as necessary to obtain the grain necessary to industrialise in the fashion that the government sees as necessary, has been generally disliked by the peasant masses. Some have even evoked the programme of collectivisation to the Tsarist time, seeing it as a return of the time as serfdoms, which is rooted in the issue that collective farms (kolkhozs) do not even pay their farmer a formal wage. Instead the farmers are paid in goods like food, water, clothes, et cetera, with the goods the farmers receive being generally less than their grain they deliver to the government is worth.\n\nThus farmers, as an act of retaliation, and wanting to prevent their livestock among others to be collectivised, have begun to eat, kill and dispose of their livestock in massive numbers, they hope thus to prevent the livestock getting into the hands of the kolkhozes. They have also started to destroy things like tools among others as well, as tools will also be collectivised and thus become part of the kolkhozes.\n\nWhile this will certainly not stop the collectivisation of the agriculture it has shown that many farmers do not look kindly upon the collectivisation and has generally destabilised our nation, seeing it as a pure way for farmers to get exploited by the government, who wants to use the cheap grain to further industrialise the nation."
 russoc.106.a: "We will have to educate the farmers on the superiority of collectivisation"
 russoc.107.t: "Search and Requisition"
 russoc.107.d: "The spectre of collectivisation seems to have also now entered the mind of children throughout the republic, as a [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] form has Cowboys and Indians has become popular, known as 'Search and Requisition.' In this game, there are two teams: kulaks hiding grain and requisitioning brigades intending to requisition the grain. The [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government has encouraged this, seeing it as a possibility to increase the influence of Socialists among the children."
 russoc.107.a: "We shall turn the youth into good Socialists"
 russoc.108.t: "Reds and Whites"
 russoc.108.d: "A truly socialist courtyard game has become popular among children, the game in question being called 'Reds and Whites', a form of Cowboys and Indians, where the Cowboys are the Reds and the Indians the Whites. The game has become so popular, in fact, that companies have begun to sell air-guns explicitly for Reds and Whites, with those guns being very popular among children too. The government has strongly supported this, seeing it as a way to mould the youth to be more open to Socialism in the future."
 russoc.108.a: "Children are like soft wax"
 russoc.109.t: "Change in Family Rules Result in Spike in Divorce Rates"
 russoc.109.d: "While many revolutionaries had a religious background or learned at religious schools, they do not have a good opinion of the Church in general, seeking to break the Orthodox Church and its influence on the Russian society both legally and through their public influence. However, while curbing their cultural influence will take longer, the government has begun legally eroding the Orthodox Church's influence.\n\nThe [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government has begun measures to take away control over marriage formation from the Church and make it a civil affair of the government. They have also greatly simplified divorce, where it is now a simple matter of registration, instead of the former hard process in Tsarist and Republican Russia.\n\nHowever, while this has greatly improved the mobility of women to leave abusive families, it also resulted in a massive spike of divorce rates on a level never seen before, with the divorce rate being the highest in the world now, thanks to divorces being this easy."
 russoc.109.a: "An unforeseen consequence for sure"
 russoc.110.t: "The Latinisation of the Languages Begins"
 russoc.110.d: "As socialism seeks to unite humanity and wither away states in the future, many in the government have proposed that the [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government should begin Latinising the languages in its nations, as the Cyrillic alphabet would impede communication between Western Europe and Russia and the people compromising it, among others. However, the full undertaking of Latinisation of all languages in Russia will take a long time, considering the number of languages there are.\n\nThus the government has begun the Latinisation of the alphabets of the many, many languages which are spoken in the nations compromising our Union. The move is spearheaded by the Commissar of Enlightenment, Anatoly Lunacharsky, who is known for his rather unorthodox opinions, like his opinion that scientific socialism is the deification of humanity, saying that socialists were the most religious group."
 russoc.110.a: "It will be worth all the effort"
 russoc.111.t: "Formation of the Young Pioneers"
 russoc.111.d: "The Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organisation has recently been founded after a long conflict between the Komsomol and the scout movement was decided in favour of the scout movement, who wanted an independent organisation while Komsomol wanted to keep them integrated into their organisation. The scouts were helped by the widow of Lenin, Nadezhda Krupskaya, who supported the cause of their movement against Komsomol.\n\nThe intent of the Young Pioneers is to further integrate the youth into the state machinery, swearing an oath to 'stand firmly for the cause of our Communist Party.' While we are not yet able to integrate a majority of the youth into the pioneer organisation, we have already been able to have 1 in 5 children be members of the Young Pioneers.\n\nThe routine of the Young Pioneers consists of a lot of marching and singing, gymnastics and sport. Young pioneers also have their own uniform - a white shirt and red scarf -, banners, flags and songs, which have given the Young Pioneers a great amount of popularity among the youth, as they give many who feel alone and atomised some feeling of belonging in the world."

They were barred from numerous prestigious positions and would often struggle to advance in their career.

 RUS_karl_radek: "카를 라데크"
 RUS_karl_radek_leader_desc: "Karl Radek would struggle to count the number of socialist movements he's had a hand in over the years. Born in Austria-Hungary to a Jewish Litvak family, he joined the Social Democracy of Poland and Lithuania and participated in the Revolution of 1905 in Warsaw - only to get expelled a few years later during an anti-semitic and anti-Leninist campaign within the party. He briefly worked for the German SPD before getting expelled from it as well. He then worked for the Bremen Left, attended the Zimmerwald Conference in Zurich, and ultimately left for Petrograd in the same sealed train as Lenin to join the October Revolution. He did, however, not stay in Russia either - in late 1918, he crossed borders in secret to join the revolutionary events taking place in Germany, moments before they were crushed by the Kaiser.\n\nThis brief adventure is what saved his life - instead of being executed, as the Whites did to all Bolsheviks they could find, Radek was kept in prison by the Germans until he was eventually released in the late twenties, at which point he once again moved to Russia, \"the weakest link in the capitalist system\". An ardent revolutionary and a radical even among radicals, Radek stresses the need for Russia to quickly develop itself through the use of extensive state planning in order to prepare for the coming world revolution."
 RUS_aleksandra_kollontai: "알렉산드라 콜론타이"
 RUS_aleksandra_kollontai_leader_desc: "Aleksandra Domontovich, marriage name Kollontai, was born to a liberal cavalry general from whom she inherited an interest in history, analytics and political reform. Her leftist sympathies began when she was sent to Western Europe to distance her from a relationship with a poor fellow student, and she started reading into radical leftist literature during the exile. During this time, she became an ardent supporter of women rights, and trade unionism, these views of hers were further driven towards Syndicalism by her lover, Aleksandr Shlyapnikov.\n\nKollontai was a Menshevik until 1915, when she broke over the issue of the Great War, and joined the Bolsheviks instead. During the botched October Revolution, she was a member of the Central Committee and sought to use her position to put her feminist ideology into practice, but the Russian Civil War put an end to her designs. Alongside Shlyapnikov, she helped found the Trade Unions' Socialist Party, the movement closest to orthodox French syndicalism on Russian soil - it proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."
 RUS_aleksey_rykov: "알렉세이 리코프"
 RUS_aleksey_rykov_leader_desc: "Born from rural Russian peasantry, Aleksey Rykov was an early member of Social Democratic Labour's Bolshevik faction and a supporter of Vladimir Lenin over his political rivals in the movement. After returning from exile in Siberia in 1917, he joined the October Revolution, although he disagreed with the radical inclinations of the Bolshevik movement, and was put in charge of the fledgling Soviet state's industry. During this period, he organised the policy of War Communism, although he later regretted its most brutish measures and the peasant resentment it sparked.\n\nRykov survived the end of the Russian Civil War and joined Nikolay Bukharin in exile to form the People's Socialist Party - the two men found a lot of common ground in their call for caution while transforming the Russian economy and for moderation among the radical factions of the Central Committee."

He was an early member of Social Democratic Labour and its Bolshevik faction, convened the conference which founded its youth movement, the Komsomol, and maintained contact with the rest of the party while in exile in the West. There, his political thought was influenced by the European Left, the Austrian Marxists and non-Marxist scholars such as Aleksandr Bogdanov, and he constantly came into ideological conflict with Vladimir Lenin despite remaining a loyal Bolshevik.\n\nBukharin played a key role in the botched October Revolution and emerged as a member of the Soviet republic's left wing - he vehemently opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and believed in the prospect of a world revolution, especially when revolutionary events in France began to break out. After the revolution was suppressed, Bukharin was one of the few who managed to escape the gallows, and organised the underground Bolsheviks in the following years into the People's Socialist Party. Wary of possible bureaucratisation and \"military-feudal exploitation\" of the peasantry, Bukharin endorses a moderate approach of cautious industrialisation and an alliance between the proletariat and peasantry."

Devoted to trade unionism and the struggle of Russian labour for control of their means of production, he allied himself with several radical leftist parties before finally joining the Bolsheviks, although he always pronounced his goals above any of their ideological designs. Because of this, though he participated in the October Revolution, Shlyapnikov constantly came into conflict with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and constantly criticised their authoritarian tendencies when the rights of workers should be their primary concern.\n\nAs a less prominent Bolshevik, Shlyapnikov escaped the gallows, but continued his political crusade. Alongside his lover Aleksandra Kollontai, he founded the Trade Unions' Socialist Party, and started drifting towards Syndicalism after seeing the success of the French revolution - the TUSP proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."

Even at a young age, he did not lack ambition - once the Weltkrieg began, he proudly declared that he will either be a general at thirty or dead by then. After showing skill and bravery in the Eastern Front, Tukhachevsky fulfilled this goal - but not in the way he anticipated. He joined the Red Army as a volunteer and rapidly rose in rank, becoming a close associate to Leon Trotsky and achieving the rank of General not long after Lenin's assassination. The Fifth Army he commanded was one of the Red Army's finest units and pioneered the concept of motorised concentration warfare, but was ultimately defeated by Vladimir Kappel.\n\nAlongside several high ranking Bolsheviks and Red Army leaders, Tukhahevskiy escaped to France, a nation he was already familiar with, and offered his service to the newly established Commune. In the following years, he dedicated his time to essay after essay on the reforms which he believed the French army needs - his close associates said that he owns over a hundred volumes on military tactics and has read every single one. Tukhachevsky expressed dismay at the decentralised structure of the Syndicalist Commune, believing it unfit for modern warfare, and proposed the creation of a unified, centralised, apolitical army instead. Because of this, he came into constant conflict with the French government, but the CGT could not simply remove him from the academy - even they understood that Tukhachevsky was the best general which the Internationale has available.\n\nTo resolve this, he and the other Bolsheviks were sent to Patagonia to lead a military mission to help the Argentinian Revolution."

Early in his life, he got drawn to Georgian nationalist poetry and enrolled in the Tiflis Seminary, but abandoned his previous calling when he came into contact with socialist literature. He dedicated himself to Marxism, joined the Bolshevik faction of the RSDLP, and raised money for the revolution with protection rackets, counterfeiting and bank robberies. He was a loyal follower of Lenin and represented the party in the public by running the newspaper 'Pravda', and his articles there helped make a name for himself as well.\n\nDuring the fateful months of 1917, Dzhugashvili helped organise the July Days uprising and the October Revolution, and gained a seat in the Sovnarkom. He, Lenin and Trotsky formed the informal troika which controlled the state - as a result, Dzhugashvili was sent to Tsaritsyn to organise resistance against the Whites, where he showed himself as an adequate, if reckless commander. Once Lenin was assassinated in August 1918, it was Trotsky who took charge and not him - but the Soviet state was not one to last, eventually collapsing. Dzhugashvili, unlike Trotsky, managed to escape, making his way to France with the rest of the Bolshevik remnants, and helped reestablish the Party in exile.\n\nTo support the Patagonian Syndicalist revolution, Dzhugashvili was sent to the Southern Cone alongside a mission of other Bolsheviks, and alongside Makhno, he is one of the highest ranking Internationale officials in Patagonia - albeit unlike Makhno, representing the political interests of the Internationale.§!\n\n§YNotes: Aligned with the Communist faction."

Shaposhnikov's most famous contribution to the Russian army is the three volume military theory work named 'The Brain of the Army', in which he detailed his view on the future of warfare.\n\nDrawing from his experience of the Weltkrieg, he asserts that wars following it will be even more deadly than before, and require mass mobilisation never once imagined, the 'opium of war'. For a country to prevail in modern warfare, they must subordinate military matters to political imperative and a some sort of overarching ideology, which would be able to justify mass mobilisation and maintain the morale of the average soldier during years of war.

 RUS_nikolay_vatutin_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gDecember 16th, 1901, in Chepukino, Voronezh Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gNikolay Vatutin was born to a middling peasant family in Voronezh, deep in rural Russia, and lived a simple life until the events of 1917, when his scholarship was suspended because of the impending Civil War. Kicked out of school, he returned to his village, where two years later, he was conscripted by Anton Denikin's forces into the Volunteer Army. After serving the last few months of the civil war as an infantryman, he chose to stay in the military and enrolled for officer education, which he passed with stellar grades - not that he had anywhere to return to, as the post-war Volga famines claimed the lives of his family. In the Russian army, Vatutin is known as innovative and hard-working, and with an eye for talented subordinates - but far from experienced, and with an absent-minded view towards grand strategy, preferring to focus on small scale tactics instead."
