 srd.2.d: "검은 월요일 이후, 사르데냐 남부의 탄광을 독점하던 수많은 해외기업이 마침내 파산했습니다. 대부분 영국의 지원을 받던 독점 기업들은 이미 수년 동안 병들어 있었으며, 이들의 숨통을 완전히 끊은 건 독일의 경제공황으로 보입니다.\n\n이 탄광에서 비롯되는 수익성은 없다고 봐야 하지만, 가난하고 뒤떨어진 사르데냐 남부에서 이들은 가장 중요한 일자리 원천으로써 가동되고 있었습니다. 불행히도 이들 기업의 외국인 주주들은 현지 근로자들의 가장 기본적인 문제를 외면하는 경우가 많았고, 이는 종종 항의와 파업으로 이어졌으며 대다수는 무자비하게 진압되었습니다. 결국 이러한 과잉 대응책은 1904년의 부제루 대학살이란 참사를 초래하였고, 이는 사회주의자들에 의해 널리 비난받았습니다.\n\n이에 바르단젤루 내각은 광산이 파산하는 걸 막기 위해 해외기업들의 국유화를 진행하기 시작했지만, 이러한 내각의 노력은 파업을 단행 중인 노동자들이 내각으로부터 다양한 양보를 얻기 위해 노조를 조직하자 물거품이 되어버렸습니다."

As stable governance is sorely needed right now, the Marshal has decided to flood the city of Cagliari with troops, using the powers granted by the state of siege to effectively incapacitate whatever remains of Parliament and start ruling by decree.

 srd.29.d: "For the first time since 1913, free elections have been held in our Country. Across the whole Island, Sardinians of all extractions flock to the polls to express their vote. Though many lists are running, only a few are expected to have a chance to dominate the new Parliament.\n\nOn the centre and the centre-right stand the Christian Democrats of the Sardinian Democratic Union. Moderates, they look towards finally bringing political Catholicism to government after a long period of abstinence from politics. Overall popular among the populace, they're widely expected to become the biggest party in Parliament, though their internal divisions may make it possible for their Left Liberal allies to gain power with their support.\n\nOpposed to them stand the Sardists of the Sardinian Action Party; progressives and federalists, they hope to bring forward the recipe for a new Sardinia of equality and justice, and may still snatch a victory. However, they too are divided between the moderates and the almost Socialist leaning allies of Emilio Lussu.\n\nLastly, though their powerbase has collapsed since the last elections, the Rightist Liberals may still manage to exceed expectations and cause great havoc."

 srd.37.d: "우리의 마침내 이탈리아를 통일시키려는 움직임은 보다 넓은 정치권에 심대한 영향을 끼쳤습니다. 주로 사르데냐에 기반을 둔 우리 정당들은 옛 사회주의 공화국의 지하 정당을 포함하여 다른 지역에서 활동하였던 조직들과 다시 접촉하게 되었습니다. 새로운 환경에 여러 작은 지역 운동들은 무의미해졌지만, 주요 정당들은 빠른 속도로 적응했습니다.\n\n현재 사르데냐 민주연합은 사회주의 공화국에서 활동하였던 여러 가톨릭 단체들과 민중당을 합병하여 기독교민주당을 형성하였습니다. 그러는 사이 자유주의자들도 재빠르게 전국의 동지들과 연합하여 새로운 이탈리아 자유당의 기치 아래 자유주의자들을 통합시켰습니다.\n반면 사르데냐 행동당은 샤르데냐 행동당에서 그저 행동당으로 개명하고 다른 진보주의, 연방주의, 심지어는 공화주의 운동을 흡수하는 등 루수의 지도 아래 재조직되었습니다.\n\n이탈리아 정계는 또다시 격변을 겪고 있지만, 바뀌는만큼 그대로 유지되는 것 같습니다."
 srd.37.a: "아마 이게 더 낫겠지."
 srd.38.t: "행동주의자들과 사회주의자들의 융합"
 srd.38.d: "Ever since its formation, the new Action Party has been a force of the Left, friendly enough towards the causes of the Socialist Republic to be branded as \"crypto-socialists\" by the rightist opposition.\n\nIt appears this accusation wasn't completely unfounded; after months of talks with the quietly refounded Socialist Party, a fusion agreement has been reached. In spite of token moderate opposition, the new Italian Socialist Labour Party has been founded, spearheaded by Lussu and other figures of the former Socialist Republic, as well as various republicans, federalists and progressives."
 srd.38.a: "새로운 시작인가?"
 srd.39.t: "노동당과 갈라선 온건파"
 srd.39.d: "The dream of reconstructing the wide Socialist Party of old has come tumbling down in the last weeks. While the reunification was spearheaded by the Sardist and Federalist Emilio Lussu, many federalists and sardists were no socialists, like Bellieni, or had abandoned Socialism even before the Weltkrieg. As such, it was no surprise when this extremely moderate wing left the party and joined with other progressive liberal organisations to form a new Democratic Social Party; [SRD.getFarmersChances].\n\nOne notable event during the split was the heartfelt speech in favour of socialist unity given by Socialist activist and former SRI politician Sandro Pertini; he may have a bright future ahead."

 SRD_militarist_badoglio_opposition: "군국파의 반대"
 SRD_militarist_badoglio_opposition_desc: "Informally led by Marshal Badoglio, the conservative sphere within the Royal Army has started an unofficial campaign of opposition against Marras' reformist executive. Though powerful, they won't try outright subversive actions as long as the King supports us; however, they will remain a thorn on our side."
 SRD_reformist_opposition: "개혁파의 반대"
 SRD_reformist_opposition_desc: "Protesting against the return to power of Marshal Badoglio, the reformists have taken to the streets seeking to avoid a return to dictatorship; clearly guided by socialist infiltrators, these dangerous revolutionaries must be crushed."
 SRD_supremacy_of_parliament: "의회 우위"
 SRD_supremacy_of_parliament_desc: "The government in Sardinia, while never outright claiming to reject the constitutional principles that helped found Italy, has long been plagued by nominally monarchist dictatorships imposed by military men. Now that democratic reformers have been empowered, the parliament has been restored to prominence and they are unlikely to allow power to slip from them again."
 SRD_women_suffrage_idea: "여성 참정권"
 SRD_women_suffrage_idea_desc: "As part of a greater democratisation effort in Sardinia, women have finally gained the right to vote. While not always evenly applied, this initiative has seen genuine support. It has raised hope that our government will return to the mainland much better than the one that left, and has raised the spirits of our loyalists."
 SRD_sardinian_autonomy_promise: "자치권 약속"
 SRD_sardinian_autonomy_promise_desc: "Since the Perfect Union, Sardinia has been a backwater within Italy; now that we're in Cagliari however we can no longer ignore the Island's call for self-government. This has been a problem, as Sardinians were convinced that, should we reclaim the Mainland, Sardinia would return to being a rural, unimportant land. Now, with the simple promise that Sardinia will retain some autonomy after the Mainland is reclaimed, we have finally convinced the brave people of Sardinia to support our war of National Reclamation."
 SRD_centralism_enforced: "피에몬테의 중앙집권제"
 SRD_centralism_enforced_desc: "All this talk of autonomism and self-government is nothing more than political opportunism spurred by the current situation, and threatens the very unity of our nation. Sardinia is an integral part of the Realm; and many patriotic Sardinians are ready to die for their King, regardless of political leanings."
 SRD_cisl_idea: "전국노동조합연맹"
 SRD_cisl_idea_desc: "A complete crackdown on unions would only harm our nation, but at the same time we must remain vigilants towards Socialists infiltrators; by federating all truly independent unions into a big, semi-autonomous national union we will ensure a basic right of our people while keeping out dangerous radicals."
 SRD_legal_unions_idea: "노동조합 합법화"
 SRD_legal_unions_idea_desc: "We cannot deny our people the basic right to unionise. While a background check on their leadership is needed to avoid infiltrations, all unions must be allowed to operate and defend our working people's rights."
 SRD_avanti_sardegna: "사르데냐여 전진하라"
 SRD_avanti_sardegna_desc: "Yet again, the people of Sardinia will find themselves on a battlefield far from home, yet again they will take up arms to defend their beloved island, yet again many will tragically lose their life for a goal greater than themselves. However, much like in the Asiago plateau in the tragic years of the Weltkrieg, these Sardinians will put aside their differences to fight for the King, for Italy and for Sardinia to the bitter end. It is our duty to make sure their sacrifices will not be in vain, not again. While the cry of \"Avanti Savoia\" unites every true Italian, another cry unites every Sardinian, and together with these heroes we will make it reach the Mainland, Paris, Vienna, Berlin:\nAvanti Sardegna, Avanti Fortza Paris!"
 SRD_miners_unrest: "광산의 불안"
 SRD_miners_unrest_desc: "The failure of the Bardanzellu Government to deal with various issues in the foreign-owned mines of Southern Sardinia, peaking in a completely botched nationalisation scheme, has allowed unrest and radical ideas to flourish in the mining communities of Carbonia and Iglesias. With the locals beginning to organise under minor trade unions, technically illegal for state employees and very much illegal under the State of Siege, the new government will have to move towards a resolution, else the Socialist Republic intervene on their behalf."

 SRD_the_special_laws_desc: "현재 우리 정권은 암묵적 합의와 구두 계약, 그리고 의회의 중개에 의존하고 있습니다. 이는 국왕 폐하의 정부의 권력에 중대한 제약을 가했으며, 이에따라 붉은 히드라를 막을 능력은 손상되었습니다. 최근 거둔 반대에 대한 중대한 승리덕에 이 모든 관료주의적 폐물들을 제거하고 우리 - 나라의 안정을 굳건히 하는 일은 땅 짚고 헤엄치는 수준일 것입니다."

 SRD_stack_the_senate_desc: "최근 착수된 재빠른 권력의 집중에 다수의 상원의원들이 야권의 대열에 합류하게 되었습니다. 그들을 숙청할 수는 없지만, 국왕 폐하께 이 난국을 극복하기 위해 보다 생각이 비슷한 상원의원들을 임명해달라 요청할 수 있습니다. 언제나처럼, 상원이 위기를 촉발시키는 일은 없을 것입니다."

 SRD_maresciallo_a_noi: "원수여, 우리는 여기에 있습니다"
 SRD_maresciallo_a_noi_desc: "우리, 바돌리오 원수의 사람들이 이 나라를 완전히 장악하게 되었습니다. 국왕 폐하의 축복 아래, 이제 우리는 이탈리아와 원수 각하의 영광을 위해 조국의 수복으로 나아갈 것입니다. 원수여, 우리는 여기에 있습니다!"

 SRD_enshrine_church_collaboration: "교회와의 협력 보장"
 SRD_enshrine_church_collaboration_desc: "There is maybe only one entity in this country that is more powerful than our beloved King - the Catholic Church. We have had rocky relations with the Pope in the past decades; still, they have been opening to collaboration with us in the past years, and a few formal guarantees paired with the very existence of the Red Hydra will push them to our side."
 SRD_ensure_corporate_support: "기업의 지원 보장"
 SRD_ensure_corporate_support_desc: "많은 기업가들이 피에몬테나 기타 붉은 히드라가 다스리는 이탈리아의 일부에서 떠났으며, 우리의 섬에 거주하고 있습니다. 이 부유하고 강력한 기업가와 지주들은 국가 장악에 있어 매우 유용한 도구입니다; 공통의 붉은 적을 고려해보면, 그들이 우리를 지지하도록 설득하는 건 쉬울 것입니다."

 SRD_the_king_commands_desc: "바돌리오를 치워버린 국왕 폐하의 정부는 마침내 폐하의 축복을 받으며 본토의 수복으로 나아갈 수 있게 되었습니다. 사보이아 만세!"

 SRD_end_the_state_of_siege: "계엄 상태의 끝"
 SRD_end_the_state_of_siege_desc: "1919년 이래 잇따른 정부가 점점 권위주의적인 \"임시\" 비상 조치에 의존해가며 사르데냐는 선출된 의회의 총의 없이 통치되었습니다. 이러한 행태가 앞으로도 유효하진 않을 것입니다; 국민의 신뢰를 되찾기 위해선 민주정으로의 즉각적 전환이 시행되어야 합니다."
 SRD_enforce_centralism: "중앙집권주의 시행"
 SRD_enforce_centralism_desc: "Some Sardinians may feel that our return to the Mainland would make Sardinia into some sort of second-class part of Italy. This is blatantly false, as Sardinia will always remain an integral part of the Realm and will enjoy investment and support as such."
 SRD_restore_parliamentary_supremacy: "의회 우위 복원"
 SRD_restore_parliamentary_supremacy_desc: "During our exile, the Chamber of Deputies lost much of its pre-war importance in policy making and governing, in turn eroding the constitutionalist apparatus we had enjoyed since 1848. This must be reversed, as Parliament and its elected members are the only true representatives of our People and only them may truly help advise our King in ruling our nation."
 SRD_restore_union_freedom: "광부노동조합 합법화"
 SRD_restore_union_freedom_desc: "The issue of miner unions in Southern Sardinia has been a thorn on our side since the Exile began. We shall put an end to this useless strife, by fully legalising those Unions, provided of course they can prove themselves clean of revolutionary infiltrators."
 SRD_federate_unions: "광부노동조합 연맹화"
 SRD_federate_unions_desc: "The issue of miner unions in Southern Sardinia has been a thorn on our side since the Exile began. We shall put an end to this useless strife, by fusing those unions into one big, federal union we can be sure is free of revolutionary influences."
 SRD_enact_women_suffrage: "여성 참정권"
 SRD_enact_women_suffrage_desc: "The issue of female suffrage first arose in 1912, when the right to vote was to be extended to women until then Prime Minister Giolitti reversed this decision to protect the interests of his bloc and describing such policy as a \"step too far\". More than two decades later, it's time to recognise that female suffrage isn't only not a step too far, but also a fundamental right that must be guaranteed."
 SRD_reform_senate: "상원 개혁"
 SRD_reform_senate_desc: "Since 1848, the royally appointed Senate has theoretically been the counter-balance to the power of the elected Chamber of Deputies. However, there haven't been any truly absolutist minded monarchs since then, and the Senate has been reduced to rubber stamping any bill the Deputies pass. Talks of Senatorial reform towards a more democratic House have existed since at least 1911, but have never been put into effect; it's about time we finally changed that."
 SRD_tackle_land_reform: "농업 문제 다루기"
 SRD_tackle_land_reform_desc: "The power of the great landowners has never been truly challenged in Sardinia, and feudal practices still thrive in the isolated valleys of the Island. We cannot allow this to continue; through vigorous legislation we shall break up and redistribute the land, hopefully curbing these practices and increasing our support in those areas."
 SRD_legacy_sassari_brigade: "사사리 여단의 유산"
 SRD_legacy_sassari_brigade_desc: "During the Weltkrieg, the wholly Sardinian Sassari Brigade was one of the most valiant units of the Royal Army. Fighting for Italy and Sardinia in a land far away from their island, those heroic soldiers withstood terrible casualties and achieved successes few could match. We know all Sardinians share their spirit, and in our Home-Coming we will all chant, \"Forward Sardinia, Forward Together\"!"
 SRD_the_constituent_assembly: "제헌의회"
 SRD_the_constituent_assembly_desc: "The dictatorships of the 1920s have proved the Statuto Albertino to be outdated. With many eager new and young politicians willing to rewrite our Constitution to perfect our democratic system, perhaps it is time to finally retire the Statute."
 SRD_a_return_to_normality: "정상으로의 귀환"
 SRD_a_return_to_normality_desc: "After so many years of war, revolution and civil conflict, all the hard-working Italian populace wants is to return to peace, to go back to work and not have to worry about dictators and saboteurs."
 SRD_protect_the_family: "가정 보호"
 SRD_protect_the_family_desc: "Battered, ruined, but never destroyed - the family forms the most basic unit of our whole nation. Through years and years of conflict, many families had to cope with devastating losses, economic woes, and worse. We, Christians and Democrats, will never allow such horrors to repeat."
 SRD_reignite_italian_nationalism: "이탈리아 민족주의 재점화"
 SRD_reignite_italian_nationalism_desc: "In the last two decades, projects such as the Austrian-sponsored Italian Federation have sought to destroy the concept of an Italian nation from within. This process must be reversed, in the name of our Fatherland."
 SRD_for_the_progress_of_italy: "이탈리아의 진보를 위하여"
 SRD_for_the_progress_of_italy_desc: "With Italy united, the progress of the Country towards the future cannot stop. The separatists, warlords and revolutionaries were misguided at best, but some of their concerns can be adapted to our situation. All options must be looked at, for the benefit of Italy."
 SRD_move_towards_federalism: "연방주의 지향"
 SRD_move_towards_federalism_desc: "A key promise of the parties forming the National Centre was federalism, in order to best govern the various parts of our nation. Centralism, as wanted by the radical Left and Right, will only cause conflict - a conflict we cannot afford."
 SRD_six_points_manifesto: "6개조 선언문"
 SRD_six_points_manifesto_desc: "Regionalism, nationalisation of major industrial plants, agrarian reform, freedom to unionise, secularism, pan-European federalism; these are the Six Points upon which the programme of the Socialist Labour Party is based. Originally, a seventh point favoured republicanism; however, in the current situation that position was quietly dropped."
 SRD_italia_riunita: "이탈리아 재통일"
 SRD_italia_riunita_desc: "With the northern Italian Peninsula under our control, it's finally time to declare what all Italians now know: Sardinia is the successor of the Kingdom of Italy, and now inherits all the claims within its glorious borders."
 SRD_fate_of_fiat: "피아트의 운명"
 SRD_fate_of_fiat_desc: "With Turin back in our hands, Edoardo Agnelli has claimed ownership of FIAT and is requesting to have it merged with his new Automobili Agnelli. While most in our government believe FIAT to be his rightful ownership in the first place, some believe that a merger would negatively impact competition, others argue that FIAT and Automobili Agnelli don't even share much in common now."
 SRD_expand_genoese_dockyards: "제노바 조선소 확장"
 SRD_expand_genoese_dockyards_desc: "The port of Genoa has historically been one of Italy’s busiest centres of trade, and a source of prestige for the House of Savoy. It is time to restore our patronage of the Liguria region, granting subsidies for rebuilding the city and constructing new dockyards shall be put into place, and Genoa shall be our jewel of the West Mediterranean able to compete with the likes of Marseille and Barcelona. We will become a naval power worthy of respect in the new Mediterranean order."
 SRD_airports_for_italy: "이탈리아를 위한 공항"
 SRD_airports_for_italy_desc: "The chaos of the civil war and division of Italy has stalled the development of modern air travel. While we have quite a few aviation manufacturers, our domestic airline service companies are small and struggling while our commercial airports are lacking. Our effort will be two prong: we will consolidate our civilian air passenger services and promote the construction, expansion and renovation of airports across the nation. Let the mountains and hills no longer divide us!"
 SRD_finish_the_diga_di_santa_chiara: "산타키아라댐 완공"
 SRD_finish_the_diga_di_santa_chiara_desc: "The Diga di Santa Chiara was started all the way back in 1918 to provide Sardinia with the necessary electricity to power its industry. The Italian Civil War and the subsequent secession of Sardinia from the Italian Federation have seriously hampered funding. Furthermore, without the access to the wider Italian economy, the costs of finishing the project increased dramatically. 18 years later, the dam is finally near its completion with only the protective layer missing."
 SRD_nationalise_sardinian_railways: "사르데냐 철도 국유화"
 SRD_nationalise_sardinian_railways_desc: "Despite how small our island is, the Sardinian railways are currently a mess: the \"Dorsal\" mainline is owned by the British-controlled Royal Company of the Sardinian Railways which has been all but bankrupt for years, while the local narrow-gauge railways are controlled by the Sardinian Southern Railways, the Sardinian Complementary Railways and the Sardinian Northern Railways. By nationalising the railways, we will integrate the four railway networks in the interest of efficiency."
 SRD_create_carbosarda: "사르데냐 탄광회사 창설"
 SRD_create_carbosarda_desc: "Beneath the ground of Sardinia, many minerals and metals lie buried, hidden away from our factories.

 SRD_procure_entente_support_desc: "The Entente is more than just a military alliance, it is a group of nations united in their struggle to restore the rightful government in their home country. To this goal the Entente promises economic aid and know-how to their brethren. It is only right if we take use of this service."
 SRD_french_munitions: "프랑스의 군수품"
 SRD_french_munitions_desc: "Despite lacking in industry pre-revolution, French Algeria contained no small number of munitions plants, which supplied the colonial garrisons in the area. Many of the guns can still be used. We shall ask them to provide us with some of these, as well as designs to them."
 SRD_canadian_investments: "캐나다의 투자"
 SRD_canadian_investments_desc: "With Black Monday hitting the shores of Canada, many Canadian capitalists and British exiles are searching for secure places for their investments. They have found that place in Sardinia. Hardly containing any industry, investors are sure to land a profit here."
 SRD_australian_investments: "[AST.GetAdjective]의 투자"
 SRD_australian_investments_desc: "Our nation is in dire need of investments, so much so that Canadian investments are not enough. With few options left, Australians are the best bet."
 SRD_drain_la_nurra: "라누라 매립"
 SRD_drain_la_nurra_desc: "La Nurra would probably be one of the industrial hearts of the island of Sardinia. If it was not for the malaria-filled marshes that would regularly overflow. This has not gone unnoticed to the Sardinian government. Without the Piedmontese industry, they seek to exploit the few land it has got, transforming the desolate waste of La Nurra into rich, fertile soil for agricultural and industrial purposes."
 SRD_industrial_values_grant_consortium: "산업 가치 보조금 협력단"
 SRD_industrial_values_grant_consortium_desc: "While capitalism has its virtues in generating wealth for our nation, sometimes it needs some help from the government. With segments of our country in ruins, we must ensure an orderly recovery. The Società Finanziaria Industriale Italiana S.P.A. (Sofindit) shall be organised from large lenders to help finance the development of Sardinia. This will allow for large scale economic projects and a safe place for investors to put their money in for stable returns."
 SRD_italian_industrial_finance_company: "이탈리아 산업금융주식회사"
 SRD_italian_industrial_finance_company_desc: "Not all of the companies we have invested in produce adequate dividends. A careful effort by the Ministry of Finance will restructure Sofindit subsidiaries and liquidate or consolidate companies not worth saving. Besides putting ailing companies out of their misery in a controlled fashion, this will inject some more liquid capital back into our pockets. If done right, we will balance the books while avoiding excessive deeply unpopular layoffs."
 SRD_ansaldo_contracts: "안살도 계약"
 SRD_ansaldo_contracts_desc: "Ever since the end of conflicts after the Weltkrieg, Ansaldo has been struggling to convert their war time factories into civilian use. That might not be necessary anymore. Renewing the contracts from the last war should provide the company enough money to restore their old factories and producing weapons for our future war effort."
 SRD_local_munitions_production: "현지 군수품 생산"
 SRD_local_munitions_production_desc: "The munitions provided by the French has thus far proven to be of great value. But we cannot keep on relying on foreign weapon deliveries given our geographical position. Therefore, we must make our own munitions and make our own guns in our own factories."
 SRD_automobili_agnelli: "아그넬리 자동차"
 SRD_automobili_agnelli_desc: "When the socialists took over Turin, they did not only steal all the factories from their rightful owner, but also the intellectual property. Thus, Edoardo Agnelli, the son of the founder of FIAT, has created a new company, named in honour of his father (and possibly in honour of himself too), from which we can commission our armoured vehicles."
 SRD_ente_nazionale_idrocarburi: "국영탄화수소공사"
 SRD_ente_nazionale_idrocarburi_desc: "In order to secure our access to oil, we must stop relying on imports as a blockade would prove disastrous to our economy. Therefore, the government has called a new company into existence tasked to find, exploit and store fossil fuels on our island."
 SRD_expand_la_maddalena: "라마달레나 확장"
 SRD_expand_la_maddalena_desc: "With the age of some of our ships quickly reaching two decades old, more maintenance is expected to be required to keep them fit for service.

 SRD_defend_tyrrhenian_shipping_desc: "Our position in the Tyrrhenian can allow us to become a safe haven for convoys, defended from enemy warships and aircraft. We must be able to protect our allies’ shipping in the area by adopting new anti-submarine warfare technology."

 SRD_naval_hit_and_run_tactics_desc: "We need not risk our ships in a head-on engagement, we need only get small victories. We can achieve this by sending our ships to pressure our enemy repeatedly, exhausting their morale, creating openings for us to exploit."
 SRD_expand_shipyards: "조선소 확장"
 SRD_expand_shipyards_desc: "Plans for a new drydock and slipway were drafted. We see little to no reason to object to the diversion of some of our resources for this plan."

 SRD_superior_engineering: "우수한 공학"
 SRD_superior_engineering_desc: "Italian engineering is no worse than engineering from the Great Powers, but in a war, quality and quantity are equally important. We must find ways to optimise and simplify production of Sardinian aircraft."

The unavoidable reality is that we only have so many men that we can call upon for the army - however, there are women across the nation who are willing to fight for her defence.

 SRD_the_new_bersaglieri_desc: "The Bersaglieri - \"sharpshooters\" - are an infantry corps with a long history, and whose role has changed much over the years. They have often focused on manoeuvre warfare, acting at different times as light infantry, skirmishers, shock troops, and even bicycle troops to fill this role, often taking a critical front-line position. They will likely play a large role in the wars to come - so we must make sure they are well-equipped."

While Sardinians, by necessity, have composed an increasingly large portion of our army, reviving the Brigades and their local legacy might appeal to local Sardinians, and spur a much-needed recruitment drive."

 SRD_avoid_the_errors_of_the_great_war_desc: "As gallantly as the brave Italian soldiers may have fought during the Great War, the war's name still brings nothing but bitter memories for many Italians. Most absurd of our failures was sending a mere 120 artillery pieces to support 875,000 men, allowing the infamous General Cadorna to send countless countrymen to die for nothing.

The Italian mountaineers have long been boasted as the best in the world, and it would bring shame to our nation if we did not hold them to the highest standards possible. It's time we looked more critically at their previous performance."

Formally known as the \"Assault Units\", they were among the first modern shock troops, bringing fluidity to a previously static war and carving their names into Italian legend with their exploits, despite our shameful defeat. They are examples for us all - our charge will be led only by the best of the best, prepared specifically for their role. We accept no substitutes."

That is the lesson of the Great War - if modern warfare is allowed to get bogged down, then unimaginable casualties may ensue in our attempts to break the stalemate.

During the Great War, military engineers gained countless new tasks with the advent of modern war, and it's a safe bet to suppose that the next one will bring new challenges.

Reasoning that the most important thing for us is that our men are loyal and motivated, Diaz's strategy focuses on reinforcing the camaraderie between the soldiers, as well as their commanders. They may not fight for the crown, but they will fight for each other."

While the site of the academies are beyond our reach, some of the talent associated with it still floats in exile, waiting for a purpose. It's time that we reorganise the academy in exile, and turn its remnants towards the national liberation."
 srd.3.t: "바르단첼루의 사임"
 srd.3.d: "Between 1919 and the death of Emanuele Filiberto in 1931 Sardinia was ruled by a string of military governments with heavy royal involvement, culminating in the Badoglio dictatorship between 1926 and 1931. Following his ascension, King Amedeo has instead taken a more parliamentary position, appointing a succession of civilian Prime Ministers to govern with the support of the main Sardinian parties and hoping they would be able to deal with the current dire situation. Nevertheless, even these civilian governments have used the fifteen-year-old state of emergency to rule with a relatively heavy hand.\n\nWith unrest among the miners of southern Sardinia growing, one of these civilian Prime Ministers, war veteran Giorgio Bardanzellu, has recently resigned; the King initially rejected this resignation, but without the cooperation of the Prime Minister no viable governing solution could be found. Given the frequency of resignations from the premiership, and the associated reputational damage, all viable civilian candidates have refused any offers to become Prime Minister, with many asking the King to appoint a military-led National Government.\n\nAs such, and in spite of his own wishes, the King will be forced to intervene directly, putting in his hands the ultimate fate of Sardinia, as military cliques start pushing for power. Many expect Marshal Badoglio to return to government, though the memory of his last dictatorship has led others to propose the politically much weaker (and, quite importantly, Sardinian-born) General Marras as another viable candidate.\n\nAppointing the autocratically-minded Marshal Badoglio to once again lead the Government will put us on a path towards a technocratic military dictatorship, bent on destroying the Socialist Republic and restoring His Majesty's rightful rule to the Mainland. The Marshal was, and will likely be, much more of a strongman than Bardanzellu ever was, and the Monarchy might be directed to reassert its influence over the executive.\n\nAppointing the relatively apolitical General Marras to lead a fresh Executive will instead increase the influence of the various reformists, who will certainly use the appointment of a politically weak technocrat as a tool to push for further democraticisation. Perhaps this is what the King intends to happen, or perhaps this is a move to increase his influence to the expense of the military clique that has, since the end of the war, become the main threat to the King's great influence in national politics."

These new emergency powers he is seeking to grant himself will effectively make Badoglio the absolute ruler of Sardinia; this, in spite of all the purges the country went through, gave some royally appointed Senators the courage to speak up against the Marshal.\n\nThis is an especially embarassing situation, as the Senate remains the basis of Royal political power; to go through the crisis we'll have to ask the King to appoint friendly Senators as is tradition, submitting our government to the King's authority in the process and setting a dangerous precedent; otherwise, we'll need to go through extralegal means to achieve a majority in the Senate, which will be a costly and damaging endeavour seeing the often great stature and many protections these Senators enjoy."

Until today, it was not clear what His Majesty was plotting; this has changed now.\n\nThrough underground and backhand channels, the King has let it be known that he has asks for one thing in exchange for his support: a full guarantee of Royal power, and that the Marshal continue answering to him on all matters."

Shortly after, an officer informs him that the King has seen fit to appoint Admiral Thaon di Revel to head a new 'royal' government.

After all, His Majesty's rule is still opposed by many enemies within and abroad, and we can't afford to show any weakness now.\n\nStill, the people of [SRD.GetNonIdeologyName] deserve to show their approval of Badoglio and his executive, and as such special laws have been put in place to ensure new elections are held regularly and give the correct results.\n\nWith all these precautions and many powers still otherwise bestowed on the Marshal, the perpetual state of siege has been declared redundant, and has been finally removed."

In 1915, the then 16-year-old royal joined the Army on the Alpine front as a corporal, and fought his way into becoming a captain. With the end of the war, he was initially forced to follow his father to Cagliari.\n\nHowever, instead of studying the specifics of Sardinia, Amedeo was fascinated by the ancient lands and cultures of Africa. Deeply uninterested in the political affairs of the Island, he spent much of the 1920s in the jungles of the Congo with his uncle the famous Duke of the Abruzzi, leaving Sardinia in the hands of Marshal Badoglio and only coming back once the health of his father had begun to falter.\n\nNow descending upon the battlefield to fight with his soldiers like he did in the Weltkrieg, King Amedeo's reputation as a fearless explorer has now evolved and morphed into that of a fearless soldier, fighting on the field for the Country upon which he reigns 'by the Grace of God and will of the Nation'. Some initially questioned the truthfulness of this reputation, though a number of daring actions made this view marginal at best. Others say this is just an inventive way to escape from the duties of kinghood; this may well be true, but his people don't seem to care quite enough as their Iron King rides into battle to defeat the enemies of the Nation."

 SRD_country_intro_content: "사르데냐 왕국은 벨트크리크의 폐허 속에서 태동했습니다. 비토리오 에마누엘레 3세는 1919년 오스트리아 정부와의 휴전 조약에 서명했지만, 사회주의자와 급진적 민족주의자, 그 외에 다른 대중들은 비토리오 에마누엘레의 정부에 대해 분노해 들고 일어섰습니다. 이에 비토리오 에마누엘레와 그를 이은 왕태자는 퇴위했고, 아오스타 공작 에마누엘레 필리베르토 공작이 사르데냐에서 거의 누구도 보지 않는 채로 왕위를 물려받았습니다. 그러나 1920년에 오스트리아가 이탈리아 본토의 백군 연합에 이탈리아 연방을 형성하도록 하면서 이탈리아의 왕위에 대한 우리의 주장은 끝나고 말았습니다. 영국인들은 오스트리아가 요구해오자 독일의 분노를 사 코펜하겐 휴전을 깨고싶지 않아 우리가 연방에 가입하도록 강요했습니다. 1926년 대영제국이 몰락하고 오스트리아인들이 내부 문제로 이탈리아에서 철수하자 우리는 이탈리아 연방에서 탈퇴했습니다. 우리의 전 이탈리아를 향한 주장은 받아들여지지 않았지만, 피에몬테만은 재주장할 수 있었습니다. 이는 실제로는 거의 프랑스 공화국의 속국이나 마찬가지인 우리를 명목상으로나마 독립적인 국가로 만들었습니다.\n\n안 그래도 침울한 상태인 국가는 내부 분열 때문에 더 침울해지고 있습니다. 아마데오는 고작 5년 전에 선왕이자 부친인 에마누엘레 필레베르토의 옥좌를 물려받게 되었습니다. 전제군주제에 근거하여 그가 휘두른 권력은 많은 입헌군주주의자들에게 실망감을 안겨주었습니다. 이런 배경하에서 전제군주제냐 입헌군주제냐 하는 국가체제에 대한 근본적인 질문이 벨트크리크 이후로 지금까지 쭉 이 조그만 섬의 국론을 분열시켜 왔으며 현 상태를 계속 유지할 수는 없다는 공감대가 형성되었습니다. 행정부와 사법부는 이미 썩을 대로 썩었기에 모두 개혁이 필요한 상태이며, 이를 위해서는 무능한 정치환경의 개선과 사르데냐인의 권리 회복이 필요합니다."
