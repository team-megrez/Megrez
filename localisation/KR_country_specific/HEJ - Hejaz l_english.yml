 HEJ_resist_arab_invasion: "막카 방어"
 HEJ_resist_arab_invasion_desc: "사방이 적으로 둘러싸인 히자즈 국가가 살아남을 것 같지는 않습니다. 하지만 전장에서의 가치를 증명한다면 이집트를 설득할 가능성이 있을 지도 모릅니다."
 hejrev.1.t: "제2차 히자즈 반란"
 hejrev.1.d: "Even though Ottoman control over the Hejaz was reestablished during the closing stages of the Weltkrieg, the prestige of the region and the martial deeds performed by its population during the 'Arab Revolt' have kept a certain romanticised image of the event alive. With Ottoman troops stuck fighting in Kurdistan and Anatolia itself against a rising tide of conservative opposition, many in Jeddah and Mecca see in this an opportunity to rekindle the old conflict and to dust off the Hashemite banner.\n\nThe presence of Ottoman garrisons in the region and the adjacency of the Hejaz railway however greatly complicate this new attempt at independence as a limited supply of both arms and manpower can only temporarily keep Ottoman reinforcements at bay."
 hejrev.1.a: "흑색, 백색, 적색 그리고 녹색이 다시 한번 휘날린다! (헤자즈로 플레이)"
 hejrev.1.b: "We've beaten them once before, we can do so again"
 hejrev.2.t: "마디나의 히자즈 봉기 합류"
 hejrev.2.d: "Unrest has reached a breaking point in Medina as well today after a group of Arabs hoisted the Black, White, Red and Green flag above the office of the Ottoman governor. Shops owned by Turks and Jews have been destroyed in a burst of outrage against the Ottoman government as more and more Arabs see their future linked to the new Arab nationalist movement instead of the ancient Turkish relic."
 hejrev.2.a: "망할!"
 hejrev.3.t: "하심 가문의 반란"
 hejrev.3.d: "Although soundly defeated during the Weltkrieg, our former rivals in the Hejaz have seen a return to power. Rallying behind [HEJ.GetLeader], the new Hejazi state has joined forces with Cairo and has sworn to assist in bringing down the Turkish regime. This is an unfortunate event for us however as in exchange for our support in the Egyptian war effort, a tacit understanding was reached in relation to the Red Sea land.\n\nWith the Hashemites torpedoing these plans, a revision of our previous plans seems to be in order. Some are suggesting we pursue peace with the Ottoman regime and form a neutral bloc in the war. Others are less convinced and furthermore also don't believe that our nation will have any power without the much richer and important coastline. They suggest an immediate strike on the Holy Cities to shut down the Hashemites and lock the region down. Egypt will likely offer protest but if we do so before the Hashemite state can really organise itself, they will have no choice but to accept the situation."
 hejrev.3.a: "대재상부에 사절을 보내라."
 hejrev.3.b: "하심가를 공격하라!"
 hejrev.4.t: "반도로부터의 평화 제안"
 hejrev.4.d: "It seems that unity in the Arab front has already suffered its first setback as the Arabs of the inner Peninsula refuse to fight together with the Hejazis. Therefore they propose a settlement in which they would withdraw their forces from all fronts in exchange for a recognition of their independence. Furthermore they also want confirmation from the Ottoman State that the Trucial States and the Al-Hasa coastal strip are forever Arab lands."
 hejrev.4.a: "분할해서 통치하라."
 hejrev.4.b: "평화의 필요성이 없어보인다."
 hejrev.5.t: "오스만의 거부"
 hejrev.5.d: "Citing their clear military superiority and their plans to finally rid themselves of the Arab issue, the Ottoman government has rebuked our offers and announced it will not stop until Riyadh is forced to surrender and the red-white flag is hoisted above its ramparts."
 hejrev.5.a: "안타깝군."
 hejrev.6.t: "히자즈 침공"
 hejrev.6.d: "Benefitting from our current weakness, the Arab of the inner peninsula have decided to strike Hejaz and take us out before we can reorganise ourselves. They hope that with a quick strike on Mecca and Jeddah, they can take control over the entire coastline and prevent Egyptian interference. With our forces stretched thin and most tribes still debating whether to even join the anti-Ottoman revolt, our odds are looking quite bad."
 hejrev.6.a: "Hopefully Egypt will intervene on our behalf"
 hejrev.7.t: "히자즈 침공"
 hejrev.7.d: "Benefitting from the Hashemite weakness, the Arab of the inner peninsula have decided to strike Hejaz and take us out before they can reorganise themselves. They hope that with a quick strike on Mecca and Jeddah, they can take control over the entire coastline and prevent an intervention by our army on behalf of the Hejazi state. As our troops are tied up fighting against the Turks further North and West, most in the Egyptian command believe that it would be best to stall for now and see whether the Arabs can make true on their threats. Should they not be able to, we shall take Hejaz under our wing, but if they are then it would be wisest not to break ties with our allies."
 hejrev.7.a: "일단 상황을 관망하자고."
 hejrev.7.b: "Intervene on behalf of the Hashemites!"
 hejrev.8.t: "막카 함락"
 hejrev.8.d: "With the fall of Mecca earlier today, it seems the Hejazi revolt was only short-lived. From Abu Dhabi to Medina, the Arab peninsula is now solidly under the control of the Arabs of the hinterland. As conflict continues to rage in other parts of the Ottoman territories, we have little choice but to recognise this victory and abandon all hope of a Hashemite peninsula."
 hejrev.8.a: "We recognise the victor"
 hejrev.9.t: "이집트의 영토 인정"
 hejrev.9.d: "Despite holding out hope for a different turn of events, the Egyptian government has recognised our conquest of the Holy Cities and has extended us the offer to rejoin their military alliance. Whilst many of the Pan-Arabic voices in our court are happy to accept this, the less naive men recognise that further loss of life won't net us more influence in the new Middle East and that it may be wiser to shift our attention elsewhere."
 hejrev.9.a: "그들의 제안을 받아들여라."
 hejrev.9.b: "우린 동맹 따위 필요 없다."
 hejrev.10.t: "아라비아의 대의 포기"
 hejrev.10.d: "Seeing no further need for conflict now that their territorial claims have been fulfilled, the Arabs of the peninsula have refused to rejoin the Cairo Pact."
 hejrev.10.a: "안타깝군."
 hejrev.11.t: "막카 방어 성공"
 hejrev.11.d: "Despite the odds, it seems that the Hashemite bastion has held on and can now be seen as the victor in the skirmish. With that, it is now almost entirely certain that the Hashemite forces won't budge, and the time has come to formally demand the inland Arab stand down."
 hejrev.11.a: "We don't need further distractions"
 hejrev.12.t: "이집트의 적대관계 중단 요구"
 hejrev.12.d: "Our failed offensive in the Hejaz has now sparked the attention of the Egyptian government. Demanding that we immediately stand down and threatening with full military support for the Hashemites, it seems we have no choice but to comply."
 hejrev.12.a: "끝까지 싸워라!"

 HEJ_urban_disputes1_idea_desc: "Contrary to the less developed interior, the great cities of Hejaz are home to a strong and well established urban elite who participate in the world economy. These individuals, often former members of the Ottoman bureaucracy, army and institutions, have opinions of their own and have grown accustomed to the ideas of democracy and republicanism which were widespread in the former Ottoman state.

Accompanying this duty however there are also significant benefits as our economy flourishes due to its connection to the Hajj. Shipping, caravan and motor companies have set up shops in the port city of Jeddah whilst a pilgrim tax is raised on every Muslim coming to visit our sacred places."

 HEJ_ottoman_civil_service_idea_desc: "Even though we may have been opposed to the Turkish nature of their regime, we can not deny that the Ottoman Turks have left in their wake a fully functional and extensive bureaucratic machine, unrivalled elsewhere on the peninsula. As we merely took over their system during the war for independence, many of the high level functions are still held by Turks whilst almost the entire administration of the former vilayet retains the Turkish language for communication and registration."

 HEJ_arabicise_civil_service: "Arabicise the Ottoman Civil Service"
 HEJ_arabicise_civil_service_desc: "Unfortunately our young government has been forced to make use of the original Ottoman civil service in the region and these administrators' loyalties are tenuous at best. Measures must be taken to create a more loyal and purely Arab civil service."
 HEJ_police_directorate: "Found the General Directorate for Police"

 HEJ_directorate_for_motor_transport: "The Directorate of Motor Transport"
 HEJ_directorate_for_motor_transport_desc: "Motor vehicles are a new Western innovation and are becoming more prevalent in Hejaz, especially among Hajj pilgrims.

 HEJ_cooperate_with_airlines: "외국 항공사들과의 협력"
 HEJ_cooperate_with_airlines_desc: "As we enter a brave new world of transport innovations, airplanes; once a novelty and weapon of war, have become progressively more used for civilian transport.

 HEJ_standardised_weapons_desc: "The Hejazi military forces lack any form of standardisation, using everywhere from British, French, Ottoman and even domestically made mystery weapons in combat.
