 SWI_transport_of_goods_desc: "이것엔 도로에서의 상품과 동물의 운송을 표준화하고 정부가 필요한 물품을 우선적으로 수송 하기위해 민간의 수송을 제한하는 법률의 개정을 위한 계획을 상세히 적혀있습니다, 이 계획을 통과시키기 위해서 스위스 국민들이 참여하는 국민투표를 열어야 합니다."
 SWI_army_reorganization_desc: "이것엔 독일의 육군을 따라 군대를 재편성하기 위한 상세한 계획이 적혀있습니다. 이러한 조직 개편은 독일 군사 고문들의 도움을 필요로 하고 군대는 일시적으로 해체 될 것입니다. 이 계획을 통과시키기 위해서 스위스 국민들이 참여하는 국민투표를 열어야 합니다."
 SWI_freemasonry_desc: "이것엔 프리메이슨과 같은 비밀 결사와 또 다른 비밀 정치 모임의 금지를 위한 계획을 상세히 담고 있습니다. 이 계획을 통과시키기 위해서 스위스 국민들이 참여하는 국민투표를 열어야 합니다."
 SWI_revise_constitution_desc: "이것엔 공공 질서 유지를 위해 스위스 경찰에게 즉결처분 권한을 부여하고, 로망디 지역의 극단주의 운동과 같은 국가 내 파괴적인 위협에 맞서 싸울 수 있게하는 계획이 적혀있습니다. 이 계획을 통과시키기 위해서 스위스 국민들이 참여하는 국민투표를 열어야 합니다."
 SWI_syndicalist_unions_desc: "이것엔 생디칼리스트의 기조에 따르거나 신념을 고수하는 노조, 기타 정치 단체에 대한 구성과 참여를 금지할 계획이 자세히 적혀있습니다. 이는 스위스에서 극단주의자들의 영향력을 억제하고 국가의 안정을 회복하기 위한 것입니다. 이 계획을 통과시키기 위해서 스위스 국민들이 참여하는 국민투표를 열어야 합니다."
 SWI_language_acts_desc: "이것엔 로만슈어를 스위스의 공용어로 포함시킬 계획이 자세히 적혀있습니다. 로만슈어를 공식언어로 포함시키는 것은 이전에 소외당했다고 느낀 사람들을 국가와 정부에 포함시키는 역할을 할 것입니다. 이 계획을 통과시키기 위해서 스위스 국민들이 참여하는 국민투표를 열어야 합니다."
 SWI_romandy_crisis_desc: "프랑스 코뮌의 영향으로, 로망디와 오트사부아에 있는 생디칼리슴 혁명가들은 스위스와 정부에 대항하는 움직임을 보였습니다. 이 봉기는 국제적으로 \"사보이 위기\"로 알려졌으며, 정부가 이 위기에 어떻게 대처하는지에 따라서 우리 나라의 미래가 결정 될 것입니다."
 SWI_bend_to_france_desc: "독일은 우리를 도와주지 않고, 프랑스라는 베헤모스에 맞서 우리의 주권을 보장해주는 나라는 없습니다. 그렇다면 생디칼리스트의 조류에 짓눌리는 것보다는 차라리 프랑스와 함께하는 것이 낫지 않을까요?"
 SWI_enemies_on_all_sides_desc: "북쪽의 독일은 우리를 배신했습니다. 서쪽의 프랑스는 우리의 영토를 점령했으며, 남쪽의 이탈리아를 지원하고 있습니다. 동쪽의 오스트리아는 우리에게 관심이 없습니다. 우리는 적과 반역자들에게 둘러싸여 있습니다. 스위스 사람들은 자기 자신 외에는 아무도 없습니다."
 SWI_german_aid_desc: "독일은 프랑스의 노골적인 침략 야욕에 직면한 우리를 위해 원조 요청에 응했고, 스위스 국민들과 함께 생디칼리슴에 대항하는 입장을 확고히 하고 있습니다. 독일이 우리 곁에 있다면, 우리는 프랑스 군대를 물리치고 독일과 함께 국경을 지킬 수 있습니다."
 SWI_black_spot_of_europe_desc: "유럽의 중심부에는 스위스라는 흑점이 존재합니다. 아무도 들어갈수도, 나올수도 없습니다. 스위스 사람들은 그들의 나라를 외국인 혐오증과 무수한 거미줄같은 요새들로 가득찬 불가침 영역으로 만들었는데, 이것은 그들이 스스로 선택한 고립에 만족하는 것입니다."
 SWI_defend_the_borders_desc: "우리의 국경은 침범당할 위험에 처해 있습니다. 우리는 제국주의 외세에 의해 다시는 짓밟히지 않을 주권국가임을 이웃들에게 상기시켜야 합니다."
 SWI_referendum_syndicalism_desc: "이것엔 현 연방정부를 폐지하고 스위스 국민이 결정할 새로운 정부를 재구성할 계획이 적혀있습니다, 우리의 이웃 프랑스 코뮌이 이 새로운 국가를 승인할 것입니다. 이 계획을 통과시키기 위해서 스위스 국민들이 참여하는 국민투표를 열어야 합니다."
 SWI_german_economic_assisstance_desc: "스위스는 풍부한 천연자원을 가진 나라가 아닙니다. 미텔오이로파에서 스위스가 인력 및 물자 교류의 흐름을 만드는 것은 프랑스의 침략에도 불구하고 취약한 우리 경제를 지탱할 수 있게 해줄 것입니다."
 SWI_joint_command_desc: "우리 군 지휘부는 열정적이지만 실전경험은 부족합니다. 우리의 병력을 대규모 독일군과 통합할 수 있도록 지휘구조를 개편해야 합니다. 이 합동사령부는 스위스 알프스에 존재하는 양국 군과의 전투 효율을 높일 것입니다."
 SWI_ban_all_foreigners_desc: "우리의 땅을 빼앗고 우리의 문화를 파괴하려는 자들에 의해 사방에 둘러싸인 이 정치적 위기에서 우리가 발견한 원인은 '외세의 부패'였습니다. 우리 나라가 살아남으려면 그들을 추방해야 합니다."
 SWI_abolish_the_verdingkinder_desc: "베르딩킨더, 혹은 \"계약 자녀\"는, 자본주의 기업들과 뚱뚱한 자본가들의 이익을 위해 사랑하는 가족들의 품에서 빼앗겨 노예처럼 일을 한 아이들입니다. 이 아이들은 즉시 자본주의의 멍에에서 해방되어 훌륭한 생디칼리슴 가치로 재교육 받아야 합니다."
 SWI_mandatory_service_desc: "스위스를 방어하기 위해서는 성인 남성의 징병만으로는 충분하지 않습니다. 여성과 노인, 심지어는 아이들까지 동원되어야 합니다. 우리의 잠재적 적국은 수백만 명의 군대를 주둔시킬 능력이 있습니다. 이러한 위협에 맞서 싸우기 위해 우리 역시 같은 규모의 군대를 주둔시켜야 합니다."
 SWI_gold_reserves_desc: "우리의 새로운 경제의 근간을 형성하기 위해서는 오랜시간이 지나도 우리 화폐를 안정화시킬 수 있도록 스위스 은행의 금 보유고를 많은 양의 금으로 채우고 보존해야 합니다."
 SWI_the_government_has_failed_desc: "현재의 스위스 정부 형태는 우리를 둘러싸고 있는 독수리들로부터 스위스를 보호하는 데 취약하고 효과적이지 않다는 것을 증명했습니다. 스위스가 자유롭고 독립적인 국가로 계속 유지되려면 과감한 정부 개혁과 강력한 지도력이 필요합니다."
 SWI_one_people_desc: "스위스 사람들은 너무 오랫동안 우리 이웃의 뜻에 굴복하여 그들의 언어로 말을 했습니다. 이제 스위스는 이러한 외국어를 버리고 스위스의 유일한 진정한 언어인 독일어로만 공식적인 업무를 수행해야 합니다."
 SWI_swiss_french_alliance_desc: "프랑스 코뮌에서 오는 압도적인 외교적 압력에 유럽의 다른 강대국들은 코뮌의 힘에 대항하는 것을 두려워합니다. 생디칼리스트의 물결은 막을 수 없습니다. 우리는 프랑스에게 자진해서 굴복한 다음에 피할 수 없는 상황에 함께 흘러가는 것이 낫습니다."
 SWI_geneva_avenged_desc: "몇 년 전, 제네바의 용감한 노동자들은 그들의 권리와 자유를 주장했지만, 오래된 자본주의 정권에 의해 잔인하게 무너졌습니다. 이제 우리는 우리의 사랑하는 생디칼리슴 스위스의 토대를 마련하기 위해 목숨을 바친 영웅들을 기리려 합니다."
 SWI_national_defense_desc: "스위스의 국가정신은 외국의 침략에 맞서는 강력한 방어에 초점을 맞추고 있습니다. 스위스 사람들은 제국주의 야망을 위해 싸우지 않고, 이웃과 집을 지키기 위해 싸웁니다."
 SWI_beat_back_french_desc: "프랑스와 싸우기 위해 국가의 보루에서 위치를 지키고, 병력을 집결시켜 대규모 반격을 가할 때입니다. 일단 그들을 격퇴하면, 우리는 독일 동맹국들과 협력하여 코뮌의 영토로 전진할 수 있습니다."
 SWI_austrian_assisstance_desc: "우리의 원조 요청에 대해 오스트리아 제국은 이에 대응하고 프랑스의 침략에 맞서 우리의 주권을 지키겠다고 약속했습니다. 오스트리아와 같은 강대국의 도움으로, 우리는 프랑스 침략자들에게 더 강력히 대항할 수 있습니다."
 SWI_swiss_miracle_desc: "강력한 경제정책, 금을 비축한 안정적인 은행, 그리고 약간의 행운이 합쳐져 여지껏 스위스가 결코 보지 못했던 경제 성장을 이루었습니다. \"스위스의 기적\"이라고 불리는 이 급격한 경제 성장은 바로 우리가 세계에서 우리의 지위를 향상시키는 데에 기여할 것입니다."
 SWI_fortress_desc: "스위스의 방어위주의 사고는 스위스를 뚫을 수 없는 장애물로 만드는 일련의 산성과 요새를 중심으로 이루어졌습니다. 이 자랑스러운 방어 정신은 우리 군대를 영광스러운 승리로 이끌 것입니다."
 SWI_new_government_desc: "Over 600 years ago our ancestors gathered on the Rütli to swear the oath of the Swiss Confederacy. Now, on the eve of our rebirth, we must gather representatives from the Unions across Switzerland to swear a new oath, one forming the foundation of the new Syndicalist age."
 SWI_national_unions_desc: "Outside of Romandie, Syndicalist Unions have failed to make significant gains politically and are struggling with their newfound power. We must support and officially recognise the authority these Unions now have in the government."
 SWI_gotthard_desc: "Fortress St. Gotthard forms one of the three main defensive fortifications that make up the defensive network stretching across Switzerland. While strong, this network is still in need of improvements and repairs. Updating these fortresses is a key step in maintaining a strong defensive stance."
 SWI_maurice_desc: "Fortress St. Maurice forms one of the three main defensive fortifications that make up the defensive network stretching across Switzerland. While strong, this network is still in need of improvements and repairs. Updating these fortresses is a key step in maintaining a strong defensive stance."
 SWI_Sargans_desc: "Fortress Sargans forms one of the three main defensive fortifications that make up the defensive network stretching across Switzerland. While strong, this network is still in need of improvements and repairs. Updating these fortresses is a key step in maintaining a strong defensive stance."
 SWI_retreat_redoubt_desc: "The betrayal of the Romandie Cantons and the advance of the French forces has put us in an unfavourable position. We cannot hope to hold the line at the border, it is best that our military retreat to our prepared defences in the National Redoubt as we regroup and prepare our counterattack."
 SWI_cultivation_battle_desc: "Switzerland is not a nation blessed with an abundance of natural resources. For centuries Swiss farmers have fought a battle against the harsh mountain climates to grow enough crops to feed the nation. Now that war looms on the horizon, we must subsidise these farmers to make Switzerland self-sufficient."
 SWI_bircher_plan_desc: "Major General Eugen Bircher has put forth a plan to defend the nation that involves pursuing a more traditional war with a larger army and a central, mobile force that would seek set-piece battles. Choosing this plan would commit the nation to fighting a war centred around a mobile army with as many offensive moves as defensive."
 SWI_guisan_plan_desc: "Lieutenant Colonel Henri Guisan has put forth a plan to defend the nation that involves a stoic defence and continued usage of the pre-prepared fallback lines and fortresses that would ensure a campaign of guerrilla warfare throughout our nation. Accepting his plan would mean moving forward with a plan to fight a purely defensive war."
 SWI_man_borders_desc: "We must first activate the civilian Border Guard units and flood our outer defences with soldiers in a show of force against outside aggression. The Swiss people will flock in droves to our defence, and only the staunchest of foes would dare break themselves upon our walls."
 SWI_guisan_speech_desc: "What the troops need to perform effectively is a strong leader who will lead them through the darkness to victory. Henri Guisan is prepared to be that man, and has gathered a large amount of soldiers to inspire with his words."
 SWI_bullet_or_bayonet_desc: "If Switzerland is to fall to foreign aggressors, she will not go down without a fight. By bullet or by bayonet the Swiss people will fight for every inch of land and throw our enemies back from our lands."
 SWI_resist_to_the_end_desc: "Even after the battles are lost and are armies driven from the field, our enemies can not rest easy. It is the duty of the Swiss people to resist in everything they do, and to stop the enemy in every way they can."
 SWI_ski_divisions_desc: "The Swiss Ski Divisions have a mastery of the Alpine terrain and should be moved into a single, cohesive unit capable of making a decisive strike against our enemies. Properly equipping and expanding these forces will give us a powerful tool to use in the fights to come."
 SWI_mountineer_defense_desc: "The best defence is a good offence. It is not good enough to simply sit behind or lines. We must make active manoeuvres and strike at the enemy whenever we are given an opportunity, so that we may eventually drive him from our lands entirely."
 SWI_luftwaffe_desc: "The Swiss Air Force has not seen a major change in composition since the end of the Weltkrieg. Our planes are old and decrepit, and in drastic need of an overhaul. We must begin an immediate modernisation of our air force so as not to be left behind."
 SWI_mitteleuropa_desc: "Our continued cooperation with the Germans and integration of our economic and military command structures have pushed us ever closer into the German sphere. Our ties are so great that it seems almost unthinkable to sever our ties with Germany, even if we may desire it. We are already a de facto member of the German sphere, and the time has come to formally join the Reichspakt as a proper member state."
 SWI_national_bank_desc: "The Swiss National Bank is the strong economic arm of the entire country, handling the finances of the vast majority of the population and the government alike. Subsidising and assisting the bank in its operations, and allowing for bank secrecy when dealing with account holder funds, will serve to boost the economy as we recover from the Black Monday disaster."
 SWI_free_our_skies_desc: "Our terrestrial defences are strong, but can be easily weakened in the face of enemy air superiority. We should focus heavily on maintaining air superiority in order to keep our enemies at bay."
 SWI_alpine_rhine_desc: "Our border with Austria is complicated by rivers and mountains that make traversing the terrain slow and difficult. Expansion of these passages between our two nations will enhance the Austrian's ability to send troops and materials to our aid when advancing westwards into the Commune."
 SWI_economic_routes_desc: "The conflict with France has severed many of our traditional routes of supply. As a landlocked nation, we rely heavily on land routes through friendly nations in order to receive the resources we need for survival. We must expand these network in order to fuel our war effort and maintain the flow of goods."
 SWI_new_fighters_desc: "It is not enough to copy the designs of other nation's militaries. Funding a new initiative to design a truly Swiss fighter will reduce our dependence on foreign militaries for supplies and equipment."
 SWI_international_aid_desc: "Our own forces are insufficient, but we hold the moral high ground in this obviously unwarranted conflict. By pleading with every nation that will listen for aid, maybe we can scrape together enough assistance to turn the tide."
 SWI_formalize_volunteers_desc: "With a new flow of foreign volunteers established, it is now only a matter of organising this trickle of able-bodied men into cohesive fighting units. Mixing these volunteer units with proper Swiss soldiers will strengthen their backbone and improve their organisation the battlefield."
 SWI_hold_the_line_desc: "Even without a world power on our side, we must still find a way to hold the line against the French aggressors. We cannot win alone, so we must use every advantage available to us to survive long enough for foreign intervention to save the day."
 SWI_german_military_tactics_desc: "Joining our military command with Germany's has taught us that our own military tactics are woefully behind the times. The new doctrine of the German Army can be taught to our troops in order to bring our troops up to our Ally's standards."
 SWI_mountain_airfields_desc: "The lofty peaks of the Swiss Alps provide many areas for us to construct new airfields for military use. The altitude of these airfields will make them difficult for the enemy to seize or destroy in war."
 SWI_air_academy_desc: "Our air force is lacking in trained pilots and serviceable planes. In light of this crisis, we must take advantage of every possible plane we can get our hands on. One proposition is to nationalise all civilian planes and recruit their pilots, mechanics, and radiomen into our own air force."
 SWI_cross_the_border_desc: "We should look to use our air force not only as a defensive force, but also as a force capable of striking deep into enemy territory. Performing these cross-border raids into enemy territory will let our enemies know that we are capable of more than simple defensive actions."
 SWI_mountain_aa_desc: "The mountainous terrain of the Alps creates a multitude of areas where we can create new defensive AA emplacements to defend our skies. Such a network of emplaced defences will make any air force rethink their plans to invade our airspace."
 SWI_new_swiss_army_desc: "Through reform and new military leadership, the Swiss Army of today is all but unrecognisable compared to the army that marched in drill but a few short years ago. This new army is tough, veteran, and ready to take on the world."
 SWI_coal_mines_desc: "The National Coal Mines provide the strong economic foundation on which the Swiss economy is built. Expanding their operations will increase our economic output exponentially."
 SWI_reverse_economic_downturn_desc: "After the disastrous hit to our economy that was Black Monday, it has become clear the government needs to take immediate action in order to save the Swiss economy from suffering a complete meltdown."
 SWI_war_profiteering_desc: "Our neighbour's losses are our gains. Selling weapons to our neighbours as they kill each other in senseless conflict can only serve to strengthen our own position when the time comes to fight."
 SWI_economic_sufficiency_desc: "All aspects of the Swiss economy rely heavily on foreign imports in order to survive. We must work to move as many industries as possible inside of our own borders to reduce our reliance on foreign powers and encourage our economy to rely on internal sources for production."
 SWI_liscense_foregin_designs_desc: "Foreign aircraft have proven to be deadly and effective in recent wars. Our own aircraft industry is in its infancy. Perhaps the best idea is to instead licence foreign designs rather than having to spend valuable resources researching our own Swiss aircraft."
 SWI_trans_alpine_tunnels_desc: "The tunnels running beneath the Alps form a powerful economic lifeline that cross through the centre of Europe. Expanding these tunnels will increase our ability to profit from our control of these railways."
 SWI_promote_franc_desc: "The economic systems of our neighbours have seen disastrous free falls in the wake of Black Monday. This has affected the strengths of their currencies, and confidence in the financial markets has fallen. Promoting the Swiss franc as the viable alternative to the failing German mark will serve to boost our own economy in the face of this economic crisis."
 SWI_sell_war_bonds_desc: "Promotion of the Swiss Franc has begun boosting our economy, but the government is still heavily in debt. We must turn to the people in order to support the government in the face of war."
 SWI_strategic_services_desc: "As a small nation in the centre of Europe, we cannot hope to win on strength alone. We must found a new intelligence service that can solve our problems before they can snowball out of control, and give us powerful intelligence on the moves of our enemies."
 SWI_electronics_research_desc: "Developed as a replacement for the ageing German ciphers used by the Swiss Army prior to the Second Weltkrieg, the NEMA represents the nation's interests in ensuring that no other nation no matter how friendly, can read our mail."
 SWI_issues_of_the_day_desc: "For many issues of public importance in Switzerland, the people are allowed to vote in nation-wide referendums, where the outcome is determined by popular vote. Focusing our efforts on these issues will ensure that we tackle the societal problems that people find important in their daily lives."
 SWI_vienna_circle_desc: "The Austrians have recently made overtures to other nations close to them to participate in the Vienna Circle, a centre of technological advancement and learning in the heart of the Austrian Empire. Joining such a programme would no doubt allow us to enjoy the fruit of these technological advancements."
 SWI_strengthen_ties_desc: "Our continued relationship with Austria in our fight against Syndicalism is the lifeline keeping our nation from total collapse. We must make moves to ensure that this relationship holds for as long as we face a common foe."
 SWI_an_official_alliance_desc: "While we are de-facto in an alliance with our wartime ally Austria, it has become necessary to make the alliance a formal relationship. Austria commands the loyalty of a larger network of nations, and joining this web as a formal participant can only serve to strengthen our position."
 SWI_german_tech_sharing_desc: "The Kaiser Wilhelm Society is Germany's foremost centre of technological advancements and research. Applying for membership in such a prestigious collaboration effort will improve our ability to field a technologically advanced military force."
 SWI_never_again_desc: "The Geneva Strikes of the early 1930s were caused by a failing and inefficient government. We have made steps to reform that government, but there are many who seek protections against such a tragedy ever occurring again. Thus the Syndicalist Unions are to be given their own military powers, so that the power rests solely in the hands of the Trade Unions."
 SWI_the_peoples_republic_desc: "The people of Switzerland have made their wills clear. The crimes and failings of the past were caused by a government too strong for its own good, and too disconnected from the people, wallowing in its capitalist greed. Thus a new government must be formed, a government run solely by the people, and for the people."
 SWI_totalitarian_regime_desc: "The people of Switzerland have made their will clear. The crimes and failings of the past were caused by lack of protection from foreign influences. The common people cannot defend against such aggression by themselves. Thus a strong state is necessary to safeguard the nation's future comrades. For we are the only thing standing between you and them."
 SWI_loyalty_to_the_state_desc: "We must encourage loyalty to the state whenever possible, so that we may foster both a populace and a military that values the strength of the government and its ability to protect the people."
 SWI_consolidate_power_desc: "There are dissenting voices still within the government and in the streets that oppose the takeover of the government by loyal nationalist forces. These voices are muted, for now, but a consolidation is necessary if we are to identify and \"rectify\" those who still have misguided views on the government in Switzerland."
 SWI_fortress_defense_desc: "If our enemies are so keen to attack us in our homes, then we will make such a network of interconnected fortifications that the very idea of assaulting Switzerland will fill the enemy with dread, as they imagine the many millions it will take to gain even a single kilometre of our land."
 SWI_expansionist_military_desc: "Only through show of arms can we secure our nation's future. To this end, it is important that we instil a strong sense of national pride in all citizens of the nation, so that they will fight to the bitter end to defend their home and their state."
 SWI_nuclear_program_desc: "The Study Commission for Nuclear Energy's purpose is to investigate the use of both nuclear power in providing for our nation's energy needs, and to evaluate the requirements for the advancement of a weaponised nuclear programme for the defence of the nation."
 SWI_uranium_mine_desc: "Switzerland is a small state compared to the titans of Europe. Thus we find it necessary to defend ourselves with all means available to us, even if we must bathe the continent in nuclear fire to achieve our goals."
 SWI_expand_our_operations_desc: "With the world falling to chaos, the Military Intelligence Service must be called upon again and again to undertake more dangerous and more dubious tasks to defend the nation. Expanding their areas of influence and operational capacities will help them resolve whatever problem comes their way. No matter how unsavoury."
 SWI_motorization_desc: "Our military is almost entirely composed of foot infantry and horse-drawn support. Our troops are slow to move and our supplies even slower to arrive. It is important that we invest in motorisation to keep our troops from fighting the next war with the last war's equipment."
 SWI_armor_experiments_desc: "The Nahkampfkanone, an experimental Swiss AT Destroyer, has shown great promise in its initial field tests. This project has shown that we are capable of designing our own armoured vehicles, and that we should continue to invest in similar projects."
 SWI_mechanised_brigades_desc: "Our initial motorisation efforts have proved most successful, but there is still more to do. In Germany, new mechanised Leichte Brigaden have begun to show promise as the fighting force of the future, and it is only wise that we follow in their footsteps and invest in our own mechanised forces."
 SWI_new_academy_desc: "In the interwar period, our fighters relied on an informal school of training that involved local instructors and wildly differing levels of competence. Now that the Air Force is being reformed into a strong and professional force, we must take care to standardise our pilot training school to improve the quality of our pilots nationwide."
 SWI_new_tactics_desc: "Bambini-Code is a brevity code recently developed to allow for easy communication between our fighter squadrons in the heat of combat. Its use has proven wildly effective, and promoting and requiring its use among our pilots will drastically improve their ability to perform against their counterparts."
 SWI_bombers_desc: "The establishment of the Surveillance Squadrons will allow us to gain intelligence through fighter patrols in and around our borders while also maintaining a large nighttime presence."
 SWI_air_factories_desc: "Flugzeugwerk Emmen is the nation's first dedicated aircraft factory, and is designed to construct the first of many planes in the Swiss Air Force."
 SWI_strategic_bombing_desc: "The acceleration of our previous raiding campaigns have taught us that if we are to continue, we must invest in large strategic bombing forces. These forces will allow us to project our power across the continent while maintaining our air force entirely within the confines of Switzerland."
 SWI_defensive_constructions_desc: "Our previous projects have given us extensive experience and knowledge in the proper construction and design of fortifications. We can take advantage of this knowledge and create new defensive networks wherever they are needed."
 SWI_new_roadways_desc: "Our nation is one with twisting roadways and extensive railways that connect cities separated by large mountain ranges. It is important that we update and maintain our extensive rail networks so that we may move goods and soldiers around the nation as easily as possible. Electrifying tour rail lines with power from our hydroelectric dams will ensure they run as efficiently as possible."
 SWI_develop_cantons_desc: "We must make a concerted effort to develop all regions of the nation equally. To this end, we must allow the Cantons autonomy in their own development and construction of infrastructure, as well as to empower the Bureau of Mining of the Federal War, Industry and Employment Office to create a national survey of the nation's natural resources for exploitation."
 SWI_canton_improvement_desc: "Switzerland is a nation with few national resources of its own. Schmolz + Bickenbach is one of the few Steel corporations operating inside of the country. If Switzerland is to become self-sufficient in Steel production, we will need to fund their efforts."
 SWI_swiss_seas_desc: "Switzerland is a traditionally landlocked nation with no direct access to the high seas, however, this does not prevent us from fielding a fleet of our own. Whether it is a militarised navy or one of maritime commerce, the Swiss will sail the seas as proud as any other nation on earth."
 SWI_military_factories_desc: "Oerlikon-Bührle is the largest producer of arms and artillery in the nation. Their weapons constitute almost half of our nations arms exports, and giving them valued government subsidies will not only increase their productivity but ensure our soldiers are equipped with the highest quality weapons."
 SWI_final_factories_desc: "The war is becoming a large drain on our stockpiles of arms and ammunition. Our trade with foreign powers is not only insufficient, but unreliable. We must transition not only our industrial quarters but all parts of our society to a war footing if we are to produce enough weapons to last the conflict."
 SWI_expanding_the_shipyards_desc: "Our military adventures have found us currently in possession of several large shipyards. These shipyards, the first in our nation's history, could be used to produce the large blue-water navy that the Swiss people have only ever dreamed of."
 SWI_merchant_marine_desc: "Investing into a strong military navy would be a waste. By the time hostilities have ended, our navy will still be in its infancy. Meanwhile, we could instead use this time to invest heavily into our merchant marine, the voyages of which could directly impact our international trade and bring back tidy profits."
 SWI_military_navy_desc: "Rather than wasting our time focusing on trade, we should instead use our new naval facilities to facilitate the creation of a completely new Swiss Navy, one which can fight the navies of the other world powers."
 SWI_seaborne_trade_routes_desc: "The Swiss economy is on an upswing that will last for years to come. Now that we have sea access, it is our best interests to keep this momentum and begin investing into nautical trade routes to expand our wealth."
 SWI_center_of_commerce_desc: "Our continued investment into the merchant marine and maritime trade, combined with the strong state of the Swiss economy, has allowed our ports to be known as strong centres of trade worldwide, with the economic gains from these cities flowing freely into our treasury."
 SWI_independent_navy_desc: "The Lakes Flotilla of Switzerland now finds itself in possession of all of the facilities and materiel necessary to form a proper naval force. This newly created Swiss Navy must quickly adapt itself to combat on the high seas, or be sunk."
 SWI_naval_bombers_desc: "A combination of research into traditional bomber forces and naval innovations, the new Swiss naval bombers will drastically increase our ability to project power across the waves."
 SWI_coastal_defense_desc: "While we move forward with our transition to a fully blue water navy, it is still of vital importance that we support the Lakes Flotilla, for they protect the waterways in and around Switzerland from outside aggression."
 SWI_naval_officers_desc: "Switzerland's naval activities in previous years has consisted only of merchant marine sailors and the brown water Lakes Flotilla. We must take these few experienced men we can, and use them to train the next generation of proud Swiss sailors for our navy."
 SWI_ship_designs_desc: "While we have come into the possession of new naval facilities, a first for this formerly landlocked state, we cannot move forward with a fleet without first investing in ship designs. Switzerland's naval tradition is small, and thus we must move forward to design a new fleet of ships as soon as possible to begin our training."
 SWI_first_vessel_desc: "After several gruelling months of work, it is time for great celebration as the Swiss Navy officially christens its first ocean going naval vessel. The EKS Helvetia is the first of many in the new Swiss Fleet, and will serve as our first flagship as the Swiss Navy joins the great oceangoing fleets of this age."
 SWI_beneath_the_waves_desc: "While we have found ourselves in possession of large naval facilities and dockyards, it is not feasible to create a large traditional fleet. Instead we should focus on cheap and efficient submarines, so that we can project power without the decades-long investments a surface fleet requires."
 SWI_surface_fleet_desc: "Our nation was formerly a landlocked state, one that could not properly project its power on the high seas. Now we find ourselves in the possession of multiple dockyards, and as an ascendant naval power. It is our duty to create a surface fleet that can go toe-to-toe with the old powers."
 SWI_peace_at_last_desc: "We have made it through the Savoyard Crisis with no Swiss blood being shed. We have realised that violence is not always the answer, and maintaining our neutrality in the face of conflict is what makes us strong. We can move forward from this crisis as a newer and stronger nation."
 SWI_french_mission_desc: "The source of the crisis in Haute-Savoie was our extremely sour relations with our large neighbour, the Commune of France. We have had poor relations for over a decade, and it is time for this era of rivalry to end. We will send a diplomatic mission to Paris to try and hammer out a diplomatic solution to our confrontations and try and befriend France, rather than fight them."
 SWI_embrace_neutrality_desc: "The Swiss people are known far and wide as a people who value the strength of neutrality. Having survived the Savoyard Crisis without surrendering our values, we have proven that neutrality is a virtue. We should embrace this philosophy across the nation."
 SWI_beacon_of_peace_desc: "Switzerland has been through a series of tough trials and society-shattering crises, but has stood tall through all of them. Even as nations around us fight and squabble over their totalitarian empires, we stand tall in the middle of Europe as a burning beacon of peace and prosperity in the middle of the storm."
 SWI_unity_through_conquest_desc: "It is not by hiding in our homes and bracing for the coming tides that we shall weather the storm. It is by taking what is and has always been rightfully ours. The people must be united behind a common cause, and this cause is to take what our enemies have stolen from us."
 SWI_integrate_militias_desc: "The true heroes of the Savoyard Crisis are the brave men of the anti-syndicalist militias. Their support helped us strengthen our nation, but it is now time to integrate the political militias into our armed forces, so they can fight for our great nation once again."
 SWI_refugee_question_desc: "Switzerland has had a liberal immigration policy since the late 19th century. However it has become apparent that many of these migrants and refugees are to blame for many of our problems. While others have shown too much cowardice to stand up to international emigration, we must act to change our immigration policy."
 SWI_peoples_army_desc: "With the government overthrown, and the people put in control, it is now time to establish a new fighting force for Switzerland. We no longer need the figureheads of the past, the people shall lead our new army!"
 SWI_old_generals_desc: "While the vast majority of the 'Old Guard' has fled to Germany, some loyal officers still remain. However, letting them lead our armies may alienate those who fought for the revolution."
 SWI_new_officers_desc: "Our French allies have generously provided their support in training new officers for our military. With their support, we can rebuild the strong leadership our army has always depended on."
 SWI_swiss_liberators_desc: "Our people fought valiantly for the revolution, and it is now time to turn that fighting spirit towards our borders. The imperialist threat is greater than ever, and we will have to fight to defend our freedom."

Fearful of potential revolutionary influence by the Commune of France, the central government in Bern reacted swiftly by sending in the Federal Army to break the strike. In the ensuing violence 13 were killed and over 100 injured in Geneva. This has left a bitter divide between the Romandie and Bern which over the subsequent years has failed to heal."

While such a fringe rally would normally be of no concern, the sheer amount of people in attendance has caught the government's eye.\n\nThousands of people were in attendance, seemingly hanging on every word of the main speaker, Jakob Herzog.

 swiss.78.d: "With the collapse of the government in Bern following the Syndicalist uprising, a loose coalition of Unions was formed to handle governmental affairs. It has become painfully apparent that this haphazard group of Unions is not capable of running the government and all its functions.\n\nInstead, a new government has been formed under the guidance of the Genenva Council of State, with the assistance of the French Commune.

While there was the usual pomp and circumstance in the visit, Herzog made it quite clear that he was here more so to solidify relations with Italy, over any personal desires.\n\nHerzog was reported to have nothing but praise for the Italian head of state, who in turn seemed to enjoy the generous compliments. Together, the two promised 'a new era in Helvetic-Italian relations' and increased cooperation between the two Totalist nations."

 swiss.83.d: "With the government firmly in the hands of the proper German-Swiss authorities, it has come to the attention of many in the upper echelons of the new government that there are officers in the Swiss army with questionable loyalties.\n\nThe loss of Switzerland's non-German speaking territories is a blow the strength of the nation, however the greater threat of disloyal officers still looms. An internal review of officers born in Romandie and other French-speaking regions of the nation has begun, and those viewed to be potential threats are to be detained."
 swiss.83.a: "정원의 잡초들이다."
 swiss.84.t: "베른 재판"
 swiss.84.d: "After a lengthy internal review of the Swiss Officer Corps, officers loyal to the state have compiled a definitive list of those deemed potential threats to the new military government. Dozens of officers from French or Italian backgrounds, or those known to harbour Syndicalist leanings, have been detained and brought before a special military tribunal in Bern.\n\nThe show trials of these officers will strengthen the loyalty of the current officer corps to the state and ensure that any future officers know that treason will not be tolerated. However, many officers in custody hold high office within the military, and the removal of these officers is sure to dampen the strength of our forces."
 swiss.84.a: "재판을 시작하자."
 swiss.85.t: "귀스타브 콩브의 재판"
 swiss.85.d: "The trial has begun for Major General Gustave Combe, born in Orbe to a French-speaking family. His preference for French and potential loyalty to his family in French-occupied Romandie has marked him as a potential liabilty in the new Swiss military.\n\nThe trial has commenced and the charges laid against him seem damning."

 swiss.86.t: "루이 드 몽몰랭의 재판"
 swiss.86.d: "The trial has begun for Lieutenant Colonel Louis de Montmollin, a French speaking officer born in Savagnier, Neuchâtel. Montmollin is both from a French-speaking household hailing from the cantons lost to France, and has shown previous Syndicalist leanings, refusing to participate in military actions taken against Syndicalist supporters within the country.\n\nWith this information, the state has determined that Lieutenant Colonel de Montmollin is a great potential risk and must be removed from his post immediately."

 swiss.87.t: "앙리 기장의 재판"
 swiss.87.d: "The trial has begun for Lieutenant General Henri Guisan, distinguished Swiss Officer and the most high-ranking man brought in for trial.\n\nGuisan's arrest is undoubtedly politically motivated, due to his high position and Eugen Bircher's alleged distate of the man. Losing his talents would set our military back considerably.\n\nGuisan is beloved by both his men and acquaintances alike, and a sentence for him would be very unpopular. However, letting him go would show that the current government is perhaps not as powerful as they would have the people believe..."

 swiss.90.t: "루이 드 몽몰랭의 변절"
 swiss.90.d: "Lieutenant Colonel Louis de Montmollin, after being declared innocent in the Bern Trials months before, has today been reported to have fled over the border into the Commune of France. He took with him several like-minded officers who either escaped arrest or were declared innocent in the trials, along with crucial information on our military deployments against the French.\n\nThe whole affair is seen as an embarrassment for the regime in Bern and many are wondering if the military are truly in control."
 swiss.90.a: "그를 믿었던 우리가 멍청이지."
 swiss.91.t: "소용없는 숙청"
 swiss.91.d: "After the widely publicised show trials in Bern, the government has almost nothing to show for their efforts. We failed to prosecute any officers of note, and the people have taken us to be utter buffoons. How could we hold such trials and make no convictions?"

 swiss.93.d: "After the end of the Savoyard Crisis, the Swiss government to our east was quickly overthrown by pro-German military officers who felt that the government had failed them. Paranoid and angry at French-speaking Swiss for 'betraying' their nation, they quickly began purging French elements of their military structure.\n\nThis approach has obviously backfired, as today a group of former Swiss officers fled over the border into France, seeking asylum from their oppressive government. They bring with them many secret Swiss military documents, which will surely be of use to us."

 swiss.101.d: "Despite increasing tensions between ourselves and the French commune over the status of Haute-Savoie, today we have learned that the French government has suddenly dropped all plans to incense activism inside of Switzerland. It seems that the government in Paris has become dissuaded from pursuing the matter further, content to simply rattle its sabre. We have dodged what could have become a major international crisis."
 swiss.101.a: "행운은 우리 편이다."
 swiss.103.t: "진정된 사보이 위기"
 swiss.103.d: "For many months, the regions of Romandie and Haute-Savoie have been gripped by tension as Swiss socialists have petitioned the Commune of France for annexation and intervention in order to unite the French speaking peoples under one banner. However, it appears that despite initial threats against the stability of the Swiss nation, no intervention seems forthcoming from the Commune. Lacking a serious supporter and seemingly acting against the wishes of the greater Swiss nation, today Syndicalist leaders have met with the Federal government for what appears to be the first of many negotiations to end the hostilities. It seems that peace has won the day, the crisis is over."

 swiss.104.t: "진정된 사보이 위기"
 swiss.104.d: "Despite the earlier opportunity to support the French-speaking regions of Switzerland against their capitalist oppressors, we have not found supporting their movement in our best interests. Now news has come from Switzerland that Syndicalist revolutionaries in the nation, disheartened at our lack of support, have decided to enter formal negotiations with the Swiss federal government. Whatever comes of these talks, our chance to intervene has passed."

 swiss.105.d: "Now that the crisis in Haute-Savoie has passed without bloodshed, there are many who have seen the extreme dangers of having an unfriendly power such as the Commune of France right on our border. The Federal Government has decided the only way to rectify this situation is to improve bilateral relations between ourselves and the French. An diplomatic mission has been sent to the Commune to attempt to defuse the hostilities."

 swiss.153.d: "In recent weeks, both the Totalist Die Arbeiterwache and the more traditionalist SPdS parties have been working hard to show themselves as the front running party in the movement to assemble the new government.\n\nWith such a close race, tensions are bound to be high, and today a violent fight erupted in Bern between supporters of the two groups. Similar bouts of violence have been popping up around the nation, and the Union Council is beginning to worry that the violence will only escalate from here."
 swiss.153.a: "질서가 무너지고 있다."
 swiss.154.t: "The Union Council Calls for Formal Debate"
 swiss.154.d: "In an effort to stop the violence spreading across the nation, the temporary Union Council has stepped into the fray in an attempt to resolve things peacefully. It has called upon both parties to agree to a series of formal debates, to be broadcast nationally over radio, in which both parties will attempt to state their case to the general populace.\n\nTo everyone's relief, the leaders of both parties have agreed and the debates are set to begin shortly."
 swiss.154.a: "평화롭게 해결되길 바란다."
 swiss.155.t: "The Debate Begins"
 swiss.155.d: "Tonight marked the first round of the formal debates being held between the Die Arbeiterwache led by Jakob Herzog and the SPdS led by Jules Humbert-Droz. Many topics were covered ranging from economic agenda to political reforms. While there are more debates to come, whoever is more successful in this first debate is likely to carry public support through subsequent debates.\n\nBoth potential leaders have good points but there can only be one winner."
 swiss.155.a: "Jakob Herzog is victorious!"
 swiss.155.b: "Jules Humbert-Droz has won!"
 swiss.156.t: "Die Arbeiterwache Wins Public Support"
 swiss.156.d: "Jakob Herzog's impassioned speech in the formal debate, combined with his multitude of rallies and marches, have shown the people of Switzerland that Die Arbeiterwache is the only party with enough support to form the new Syndicalist government. The need for a strong hand has taken hold of the nation."
 swiss.156.a: "Herzog will form the new government."
 swiss.157.t: "SPdS Wins Public Support"
 swiss.157.d: "With Jules Humbert-Droz's sterling performance in the governmental debate, and the passion of his speeches against authoritarianism and Jorges Herzog, the hearts of the people have moved behind the SPdS. Die Arbeiterwache remains popular, but it is obvious that it no longer has enough public support to take the lead in the new government."
 swiss.157.a: "Jules Humbert-Droz will form the new government."
 swiss.159.t: "Foundation of the Swiss Merchant Marine"
 swiss.159.d: "As Switzerland is a landlocked nation, it relies on trade with other nations to survive. To this end, the Swiss government has commissioned the purchase of several merchant vessels to operate under the Swiss flag.\n\nThese merchant vessels will participate in vital trade missions which will secure the necessary goods Switzerland needs to survive should her borders become compromised by conflict."
 swiss.159.a: "Interesting."
 swiss.160.t: "Christening of the EKS Helvetia"
 swiss.160.d: "There was much celebration and excitement today as the government announced the official christening of the Swiss Navy's first flagship, the EKS Helvetia. This ship, a Light Cruiser produced from Switzerland's very own dockyards, is the first official flagship of the fleet and a symbol of Switzerland's overseas ambitions."
 swiss.160.a: "스위스인들은 항해하기 위해 태어났다."
 swiss.163.t: "생디칼리슴 정당 금지"
 swiss.163.d: "With the new provisional military government in control of the nation, a proclamation has come from Bern that all Syndicalist organisations operating in the country, legally or otherwise, are to be immediately dissolved. This proclamation has been met with a surprising amount of popular support, as the remaining population of the country rallies against Syndicalist \"traitors\"."

 swiss.164.d: "An agreement has been made to allow for economic supplies to flow from Mitteleuropa into Switzerland to keep the nation afloat. However, while this temporary arrangement is supporting our economy for now, perhaps we should consider full membership in Germany's economic bloc?"

 swiss.165.t: "검은 월요일을 맞은 농부들"
 swiss.165.d: "With the German economy in freefall, the prices of many agricultural goods have fallen with it. Swiss farmers, heavily reliant on trade with Germany, have been hit hard almost overnight, and many have taken to the streets to protest the government's inaction over the issue. The BGB (Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents) who represents the interests of many Swiss farmers, and Social Conservative KKP (Catholic-Conservative Party) have begun wavering in their commitment to the current governing alliance of Conservative and Market Liberal parties."
 swiss.165.a: "좋지 않아."
 swiss.166.t: "프랑스와의 화해를 제안하는 사회주의자들"
 swiss.166.d: "As a part of their ambitious Syndicalist-styled plan to recover the Swiss economy, Socialist leaders in the Romandie have proposed that the Swiss government save the economy through reconciliation with the Commune of France.\n\nEver since Switzerland began the occupation of Haute-Savoie, the French have embargoed Switzerland, and cut off a valuable trade route for the Swiss economy. These socialist leaders have called for the return of this land to France as a sign of goodwill on behalf of Switzerland towards France."
 swiss.166.a: "어림도 없다."
 swiss.167.t: "사부아에서의 불법 국민투표"
 swiss.167.d: "With the Federal Government in Bern so adamantly opposed to the Socialist plans for reform, a movement has gained popularity for an organised referendum on sovereignty in Haute-Savoie. The Socialists believe that if the Savoyards can be shown to wish reunification with the Commune of France, then the government will have to support their plans. Bern has caught wind of this illegal referendum taking place in the region soon, and has vowed that such a vote outside of the law will not be allowed to take place."
 swiss.167.a: "당장 멈춰라!"
 swiss.168.t: "오트 사부아에서의 폭력"
 swiss.168.d: "The day of the proposed referendum has come, and violence runs rampant in Haute-Savoie. Swiss military presence in the occupied zone, on high alert on orders from Bern, has clashed repeatedly with Socialist and Syndicalist protestors attempting to organise the vote in the area.\n\nDozens have been beaten and bloodied, and the region is in a state of disarray as military forces and Socialist agitators from Romandie clash in the streets. It is only a matter of time before France hears of this commotion..."
 swiss.168.a: "완전히 통제불능이군."
 swiss.169.t: "생디칼리스트가 국민투표의 승리를 주장하다"
 swiss.169.d: "Days after the violence in Savoie, the Syndicalist Party of Switzerland has declared that the results of the referendum are in and the region has voted to rejoin the Commune of France. In the chaos, it is impossible to verify the integrity of the vote, and the Socialists, who hold the ballots, have not offered to hand anything over to the federal government. Many in Bern doubt the validity of the Socialist claim, but it has increasingly seemed like a shouting match between two sides that won't back down..."
 swiss.169.a: "그 결과는 불법이고 검증되지 않았다!"
 swiss.170.t: "오트사부아 점령지에서의 폭력"
 swiss.170.d: "Reports have come to Paris bearing news of the violent oppression of Syndicalist freedom fighters in Haute-Savoie who were attempting to organise a referendum on the region's return to French governance. The Swiss government in Bern has sent a military force to suppress the vote, and violence has broken out over the legality of the referendum. We can't ignore this violence against our people!"

 swiss.171.t: "로망디 분리독립"
 swiss.171.d: "With no nation willing to defend Switzerland, and our government's weakness exposed for all the world to see, the local governments in Romandie, reinstated by French demands, have quickly voted to secede from the Swiss Confederation and join the Commune of France. We are powerless to stop them."
 swiss.171.a: "그들 모두가 배신자들이다."
 swiss.172.t: "로망디 분리독립"
 swiss.172.d: "After Switzerland pathetically accepted our demands for the return of Haute-Savoie, they were forced to reinstate publicly elected Socialist officials that they so viciously removed from their posts earlier in the year. These politicians, to our surprise, wasted no time in voting on secession from the Swiss Confederation in favour of joining the Commune of France as brothers in French Socialism.\n\nWe of course have accepted their legal and popular move, and have welcomed them into our fold."

 swiss.178.t: "오트사부아의 혼란!"
 swiss.178.d: "With French support and a lax military presence in the region, French saboteurs have managed to stir unrest in Haute-Savoie, and the administration will be forced to spare extra resources to maintain the peace. We must maintain a stronger military presence if we are to keep the region stable."

 swiss.179.t: "코뮌의 패배"
 swiss.179.d.war: "The Commune of France has found itself soundly defeated and removed from the landscape of Europe. With the largest threat to our nation now a thing of the past, we no longer have to worry about the looming threat of war."
 swiss.179.d.cooperation: "The Commune of France has found itself soundly defeated and removed from the landscape of Europe. Unfortunately for us, it means whatever we gained from cooperating with them is also gone... but, on the other hand, we no longer have to worry about their influence or the threat of a war."

 swiss.180.d: "With a semblance of peace and order restored to Europe in the form of the defeat of the Commune of France and a restoration of a legitimate French government, it is time we honour our obligations made at the end of the Weltkrieg and return Haute-Savoie to French control. We have been its careful stewards for many years, but our commitment to our promise is resolute. The territory must be returned, and the French government will surely be grateful for the safeguarding of their land."
 swiss.180.italian: "With a semblance of peace and order restored to Europe in the form of the defeat of the Commune of France, and the consolidation of Savoy under the new Italian regime, it is time we end our custodianship of the territory of Haute-Savoie. We have been its careful stewards for many years, but our commitment to the Treaty of Turin of 1816 remains true. The territory's neutrality is no longer threatened, and the new Italian government will surely appreciate the legitimacy of being seen as the territory's legitimate nation."
 swiss.180.syndie: "The old Swiss order has been overthrown, and in its place a new and proper Syndicalist government has arisen. In order to solidify our relation with our neighbouring Syndicalist Commune of France, we must make good on a promise made many years ago and return Upper Savoy to Communard rule. With this act of cooperation, we can surely align ourselves with the power that is France."

 swiss.181.d: "Switzerland has approached us with an offer to return the region of Upper Savoy to our control after controlling the region for nearly two decades.

 swiss.186.t: "The New Order Falls"
 swiss.186.d: "Not even a year after toppling the old Swiss government and establishing a military dictatorship \"for the good of the nation\", the government of the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband has shown itself completely incapable of rallying public support.\n\nAn increasing amount of public protests have culminated in a storming of governmental offices in the capital and the seizing of key areas by mutinous military units in league with the uprising.\n\nEugen Bircher is missing, as are many of the officers involved in the coup, but for now a new government has been created from more moderate conservatives in the government until the old Federal Government can be properly restored."

 swiss.187.d: "An outpost in Mittelland, not responding to radio contact, was today discovered to have been attacked and raided by an unknown enemy.

The men defending the outpost were found to have been killed defending it. We must avenge their deaths."
 swiss.187.a: "Scoundrels."
 swiss.188.t: "Gunfire in Bern."
 swiss.188.d: "Gunfire rang out in the early morning today in Bern as unidentified gunmen attempted to attack a military patrol moving through the streets. The gunmen were killed without military casualties, but the shock of the incident has rattled citizen's trust in our control of internal affairs."
 swiss.188.a: "Troubling."
 swiss.189.t: "Popular Support Rising"
 swiss.189.d: "Our recent policy of increased military patrols and police presence have reduced crime rates dramatically across the nation, and the people are slowly coming around to the idea of our government being their protectors."
 swiss.189.a: "We protect the people."
 swiss.190.t: "An increase in patrols?"
 swiss.190.d: "While our recent military activities have been successful in quashing resistance across the nation, especially in urban areas, it has been proposed that we increase our military presence in the more rural regions of Switzerland as well. These are the regions most difficult to maintain order in, and it would require a significant increase in manpower to cover these areas."
 swiss.190.a: "It will be done."
 swiss.190.b: "Those men are better spent elsewhere."
 swiss.191.t: "Fighting on the Frontier"
 swiss.191.d: "Our recent decision to oust foreign agents from the nation has driven many to the frontiers to hide and work against the state. In recent days these fighters have been in numerous battles against military forces patrolling in these areas, and casualties have mounted among our forces."
 swiss.191.a: "망할 놈들."
 swiss.192.t: "The Nation Secured"
 swiss.192.d: "Despite the continual efforts of Syndicalist partisans to sabotage our efforts to maintain peace and order, we have successfully identified and crushed all major sources of resistance and potential dangers to the government. With this, a new era of peace can be ushered in."
 swiss.192.a: "드디어 평화가 왔군."
 swiss.193.t: "프랑스-스위스인들이 프랑스로 이동하다"
 swiss.193.d: "The rising tide of anti-French sentiment has manifested itself in recent days in a string of violence and harassment against the significant French-speaking population remaining in the nation. This divide has caused a wave of citizens to flow over the border into the French-occupied Haute-Savoie, and the military is struggling to clamp down on some of the more extreme cases of discrimination in the countryside."
 swiss.193.a: "Less traitors to worry about."
 swiss.194.t: "프랑스로의 프랑스-스위스인 이동"
 swiss.194.d: "Unable to accept the truth of a unified France under a Syndicalist regime, the reactionary government of Switzerland has begun a new campaign of persecution against the population of French-speaking Swiss still within their borders. This has resulted in a flow of migrants over the border into our nation, and many have shown an interest in taking up arms for an eventual liberation of their homeland from the reactionary menace."
 swiss.194.a: "You are welcomed with open arms."
 swiss.197.t: "민병대 통합"
 swiss.197.d: "Eugene Bircher's political militias helped us prevent syndicalist subversion before the coup, but many in the government are questioning the use of the militias now. Bircher has committed to disbanding many of the militias, however it is the choice of the government whether to simply encourage the conscription of militia personnel into our military, or to take a more direct approach."

 swiss.198.t: "Deciding our Immigration Policy"
 swiss.198.d: "While Switzerland has acted liberally towards immigration in the past, the danger to our nation is too great to allow this unrestrained migration to continue. Our government has already decreed that we must address this issue; the time has come to amend our immigration policy."
 swiss.198.a: "제한적으로 변경하여라."
 swiss.198.b: "Radically reduce immigration."
 swiss.199.t: "오이겐 비르허의 망명"
 swiss.199.d: "Due to the large pro-German bias that was present in the old government, Eugen Bircher was able to take a high-ranking position in the army. However, it has become apparent that his loyalty has never been to Switzerland and he has since fled to Germany along with some other capitalist refugees, too afraid to allow themselves to be judged fairly for their crimes against the Swiss people."
 swiss.199.a: "그립지는 않겠군."
 swiss.201.t: "남은 지휘관들"
 swiss.201.d: "While Major General Bircher fled after the revolution, many of his brothers-in-arms have opted to stay. Their remaining in Switzerland demonstrates a great level of faith and loyalty to our nation, and their experience in the army would be invaluable to our efforts to rebuild the military. However, their involvement with the old guard of the military has made their status controversial among hardline revolutionaries. The possibility of removing them though is out of the question, and instead it is perhaps best that we take on a more militant posture."

 SWI_jakob_herzog_leader_desc: "Jakob \"Joggi\" Herzog was born 1892, in Lucerne, to a family of Catholic Swiss Germans. Having lost his parents at an early age, Herzog was raised in an orphanage, before taking on a carpenter’s apprenticeship as a young man. He eventually abandoned this career and fell in with the radical politics of the Swiss Social Democrats and the International Union of Socialist Youth Organisations. He became a close collaborator to the Youth International’s German president Willi Münzenberg, serving as his vice-president during the Weltkrieg. Herzog’s combative and hotheaded personality eventually saw him expelled from the Social Democrats, whereafter he formed his own group \"Forderung\" (Demand), which was strongly influenced by the Christian Socialist and Anarcho-Syndicalist ideas of Fritz Brupbacher and Jules Humbert-Droz. During the Swiss General Strike of 1918 Herzog rallied disaffected soldiers and students in Zurich to take up arms against the government, forming a Zurich Workers Council in hopes of replicating the success of the Russian Revolution. The chaotic uprising failed and Herzog was imprisoned for ten months, during which time his political ideas moved in a more authoritarian and militant direction. Upon his release he studied the Dutch Marxist Anton Pannenkoek’s \"Tribunist\" movement and later took a great interest in the ideas of the French Socialist Revolution, particularly the Sorelians. Even so, Herzog began forging his own ideological path, establishing a more personalistic leadership in Forderung. Though he had once been an anarchist, Herzog now called for the creation of centralised Syndicalist states based upon \"revolutionary parliamentarism\" and criticised the \"inconsistencies, opportunism and elitism\" of moderate Syndicalists. His views on Christian Socialism took decisive influence from the French Sorelians, a far cry from the ideals of his former idols Brupbacher and Humbert-Droz. In 1921 he forged an unlikely alliance with his old rivals Léon Nicole and Fritz Platten, cooperating with their Solidarité (Solidarity) group to strengthen the radical Swiss trade unions. This partnership deepened in 1927 with the founding of \"die Arbeiterwache\", or \"le Garde Ouvrière\" (The Workers Guard), a dedicated political paramilitary for the Swiss socialist movement, that has served as Herzog’s main source of influence outside of the more close knit Forderung group."
 SWI_swiss_federal_council_leader_desc: "Founded in 1848, the Swiss Federal Council is a seven-member executive council which serves as the collective head of state for Switzerland.

 SWI_country_intro_header: "The State of Switzerland"
 SWI_country_intro_content: "The Swiss Confederation saw crisis in 19th century. In several cantons liberal powers prevailed, calling for more democracy and more centralism. This met the opposition of the Catholic, conservatively dominated cantons who formed the Sonderbund in 1845. The Sonderbund War erupted in 1847 which saw the liberals as victors. In 1848 a Federal Constitution was ratified, turning the loose league of cantons into a federal state with a new federal capital in Bern. The new constitution created new institutions like the Bundesrat (Federal Council), Bundesversammlung (Federal Assembly), and Bundesgericht (Federal Court). Switzerland remained neutral throughout the Weltkrieg, although there were various domestic conflicts between German and French speaking Swiss citizens. In addition economic problems arose, completely surrounded as the country was by warring nations. The radical left gained a lot of support during that time, and in 1919 a strike in Geneva called for by the workers movement attempted to push through major social changes. The attempt failed because of the fear of spreading of French syndicalism and its subsequent repression by Swiss government, but in its wake social reforms were begun, bringing about higher wages and shorter work days. In 1919 the system of proportional representation was introduced. The conservative Freisinnige lost their majority while the social democrats grew stronger. Into the 1930s domestic politics were governed in response to the conflict between social democrats and conservatives. The struggles between communities in Switzerland are now taking more political values: French-speakers are more socialist, Germans more conservative and Italians more clerical. Will the rising belligerence in Europe have consequences on the neutral Confederation?"

 SWI_jules_humbert_droz_leader_desc: "Jules Humbert-Droz was born on the 23rd of September, 1891, to a Francophone, Protestant family in the town of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Canton of Neuchâtel. His parents and grandparents had longstanding connections to the Swiss labour movement, so Jules was raised in a radical, working class environment that heavily influenced his future beliefs. He subsequently graduated from the University of Neuchâtel with a thesis about the contradictions and compatibilities between Socialism and Christianity, before taking up work as a pastor and writer for local left-wing newspapers. When Switzerland escalated its \"armed neutrality\" during the Weltkrieg and expanded conscription, Jules became a conscientious objector and went to jail several times for his anti-militarism as well as his participation in the 1918 General Strike. The year afterwards he moved to Paris and founded the newspaper \"Le Phare\" (The Lighthouse), to promote Syndicalist ideas and solidarity between the French and Swiss socialist movements. He was subsequently recruited to aid the Third Internationale, where his responsibility was primarily the Romance-speaking world. After nearly a decade of service to the revolution he returned to Switzerland, where he sought to reconcile the Swiss Social Democratic Party with the Third Internationale, to limited success. Jules was a man of many contradictions, a zealously devoted Christian who nevertheless always defended the Parisian political line, even as tensions in France escalated over anti-clericalism. He turned the other cheek when radicals questioned his whether his ardent pacifism did more to harm the revolution than help it.\n\nTo Jules, pacifism did not preclude waging a righteous struggle, but it mandated him to oppose the senseless violence he saw embodied by men such as Jakob Herzog and Léon Nicole. He rejected their paramilitary methods and turned towards mainstream politics, hoping to usher in a Syndicalist revolution by the ballot. He was later elected to the National Council representing Zürich, though Neuchâtel still remains as his primary base of operations as he serves as its local Social Democratic Party's de-facto leader."
 SWI_robert_grimm: "Robert Grimm"
 SWI_robert_grimm_leader_desc: "Born April 16th, 1881, to a German Protestant family in the village of Wald, Zurich, Robert Grimm grew up the son of a machine fitter and weaver, which taught him the skills to gain an apprenticeship as a printer. Familiar with industrial machinery, he excelled in the workshops of Oerlikon, the industrial sector of the city of Zurich an embarked on his 'Wanderjahre' (journeyman years) in 1905. This wide trip across Germany, France, Austria and Italy introduced him to radical Marxist ideas. Upon his return he joined the Swiss Social Democratic Party and was subsequently blacklisted due to an attempt to organise his workplace outside of Basel. Bereft of employment, Robert turned to journalism and political activism, leaving Basel-Stadt in favour of Bern, where he participated in the strikes of 1906 and 1912. By the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, Robert turned away from the failed optimism of the Second International and towards the ambitions of Bolshevism, spending time in the company of the Russian exile Vladimir Lenin. In the the wake of the February Revolution, he helped to negotiate Lenin's return and unsuccessfully sought to utilise his influence among German workers to mediate a separate peace between Russia and Germany. A year later he organised the Olten Action Committee in the eponymous Solothurn town of Olten.\n\nEconomic collapse and a looming famine had necessitated the Swiss Government to decree the conscription of all civilians to aid in public works, which faced nationwide resistance. When his comrades hesitated, Robert effectively hijacked the Social Democratic Party to push for a general strike, in hopes that it would break the back of the Federal Council and establish a Swiss People's Republic. The 1918 Swiss Landesstreik/Grève du Pays (National Strike) was short and brutal, leaving several workers dead and a near military coup shaking the country, as the army intervened to crush the uprising. Robert, who has ever since then been known as the 'Father of the National Strike', faced years in prison but upon his release returned to fighting for workers rights and maintained an immense political influence. In recent years he has drifted between both the moderate and radical wings of the socialist movement, but he has never forgotten his roots and has always been ready for the day that the glorious Swiss revolution, dreamed of in 1918, can truly be made real."
