 swa.7.t: "나미비아의 노동자 요청"
 swa.7.d: "Namibia is still fighting its civil war in the name of our country, and is requesting assistance for the third time.

 swa.8.t: "독일의 지원"

 swa.9.a: "Victory is in our hands."
 swa.10.t: "Germany Doesn't Send Workers"
 swa.10.d: "Germany has decided to not send workers to come to our aid, which will significantly increase the amount of time it will take to fortify Windhuk."
 swa.10.a: "We'll do it on our own."
 swa.11.t: "An Assault on Ovamboland"
 swa.11.d: "At the beginning of the revolt, the Ovambo sent divisions behind our lines as a distraction for our forces. Our generals seem to have gotten a similar idea and wish to send a small expedition to sneak behind enemy lines and launch an ambush. Should we accept their plan?"
 swa.11.a: "Approve the proposal."
 swa.11.b: "Deny the proposal."
 swa.12.t: "The Assault is Ready"
 swa.12.d: "Our troops have successfully snuck through the disorderly lines of the Ovambo, and are ready to launch the assault whenever we give the word. The timing here is important, we don't want our units to be destroyed right as they arrive."
 swa.12.a: "We'll time it carefully."
 swa.13.t: "Our Units are Found"
 swa.13.d: "Our units were almost at their destination in the back of the enemy lines, until a patrol discovered them. They were all massacred, leaving only one soldier to report the bloody incident. Trying something like this again would be futile and only result in more losses."
 swa.13.a: "Scrap the plan."
 swa.14.t: "Südwestafrika Launches an Assault"
 swa.14.d: "Südwestafrika has adopted a similar tactic to us at the start of the war, and launched an assault in the middle of our territory. It's also right next to our capital, leaving it in grave danger of being captured. We must rush troops there now if we wish to win this battle!"
 swa.14.a: "Send the army, quickly!"
 swa.15.t: "Südwestafrika Wins the War!"
 swa.15.d: "Südwestafrika has been embroiled in a civil war ever since Mittelafrika collapsed, but they have beaten back the foolish natives. With the conflict over, Südwestafrika has invited us to establish rule over them once again. Once our delegates arrived, there were talks floating about reforming Mittelafrika, but they remain rumours for now."
 swa.15.a: "Not all is lost."
 swa.16.t: "A New Governor?"
 swa.16.d: "With the crisis finally being officially over, it is time we decide who the official Governor will be. There were various suggestions and three Weltkrieg veterans who fought in Sudwestafrika have been put up for the task. The first option is keeping Heinrich Kircheim, the current Governor who advocates for overwhelming the inferior African opponents with superior German firepower, the second is Hans Hollander, who advocates for mobilising the African population to see a quick and sudden reunification of Mittelafrika, and the third option, Theodor von Hippel who thinks careful planning and thinking three steps ahead is the key to our expansion."
 swa.16.a: "Heinrich Kircheim, who led us through the recent war."
 swa.16.b: "Hans Hollander, for a quick reunification."
 swa.16.c: "Theodor von Hippel, for his careful planning."
 swa.17.t: "Resistance from Ovambo"
 swa.17.d: "Despite our victory in the Ovambo's revolt, there is still staunch resistance among a new group known as the 'Ovambo Movement', who raid towns in the hopes of letting the Ovambo people be free. This is all due to their leader, Uushona Shiimi managing to escape our clutches in the civil war. With towns being raided the conflicts do not show any signs of stopping, and the people demand we do something about the problem."
 swa.17.a: "Search for Uushona Shiimi."
 swa.17.b: "Focus on defending the people."
 swa.18.t: "Uushona Shiimi Killed"
 swa.18.d: "Uushona Shiimi who has been a thorn in our side since our reunification has been killed by loyal Askari troops at 6:12 inside a hotel inside Onajena. Although the initial thought was that the people would resent us for our actions, a lot are thanking us for dispersing the Ovambo revolt."
 swa.18.a: "He's finally gone."
 swa.19.t: "Amboland Integrated"
 swa.19.d: "With the end of the Ovambo Movement's momentum, the north of our country has finally entered a state of calm and healing. With this, we can finally stand under a strong, united nation that can face external threats."
 swa.19.a: "We are united."
 swa.20.t: "Local Village Destroyed"
 swa.20.d: "Although we have placed military police at key locations within our country, it seems some areas got inevitably overlooked and The Ovambo Movement took notice. They have managed to raid a village of all it has, slaughtering the entire population and seizing many supplies. The peaceful section of the Ovambo people is also blaming us for painting their culture in a bad light by letting these actions continue."
 swa.20.a: "Spread out the police force."
 swa.21.t: "Uushona Shiimi Killed in Battle"
 swa.21.d: "Following the recent wave of momentum in The Ovambo Movement, Uushona Shiimi himself decided to lead an expedition on a seemingly unguarded village. Little did he know that military forces were lying in wait for him, and attacked him on sight. The brave regiment managed to kill Uushona Shiimi, but the unit was wiped out by the grunts left over from the expedition. Although we have managed to end the momentum of the movement, this is a general distaste inside our population for letting this problem continue for so long."
 swa.21.a: "At least it's over."
 swa.22.t: "Rumours of Namibian Oil"
 swa.22.d: "Rumours have been circulating as of late of possible oil hidden within Namibia's crust, the question is whether these are truly rumours or truth. If these rumours are indeed true, this will result in Namibia going from a depopulated wasteland to a place of much wealth and trade, transforming the entire economy. However, to even search for the black gold will require many resources Germany is not willing to give. All that remains is deciding how much we are willing to invest in this."
 swa.22.a: "Do a quick search."
 swa.22.b: "Divert some of our funds towards the project."
 swa.22.c: "This must be a priority."
 swa.22.e: "Let's not waste our time."
 swa.23.t: "Oil was Found!"
 swa.23.d: "Oil! The black gold that was originally thought to be a simple rumour less than a month ago is now truth. With this brings significant wealth and resources that we can provide to the fatherland, all we need to do now is extract it all."
 swa.23.a: "Namibia is a gold mine."
 swa.24.t: "The Search goes Nowhere"

 swa.26.t: "Südwestafrika Requests Supplies"
 swa.26.d: "Südwestafrika has found itself embroiled in a conflict with one of the treacherous African warlords, and is requesting our assistance. It would be wise to assist, as every gun we drop down there helps us get closer to the reformation of Mittelafrika, and our presence in Africa."
 swa.26.a: "Send the supplies."
 swa.26.b: "We can't spare anything at the moment."
 swa.27.t: "Germany Sends Help"

 swa.28.t: "We Fend for Ourselves"

 swa.28.a: "We'll win on our own."
 swa.29.t: "Barotseland Resists our Invasion"
 swa.29.d: "The Barotseland campaign has caused the area to devolve into anarchy. Even as our armies still fight on the battlefield, the Barotseland people have begun to fight the troops trying to keep the peace and are disrupting further planning for expansion into Africa. The threat will need to be dealt with soon, before support can reach into other areas we control as well."
 swa.29.a: "Damn traitors."
