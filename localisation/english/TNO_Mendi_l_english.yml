 MDI_idea_disloyal_army: "Disloyal Army"
 MDI_idea_disloyal_army_desc: "The army is the echo of Mendi's difficult political situation- chaotic, fractured, and generally disunited. David Lansana's coup was delivered on its back, buttressed by the support of the nation's most important and powerful generals; yet, dissent still runs rife through its ranks, and it can be seen most prominently in the clique forming around Andrew Juxon-Smith.\n\nNot only is the army disloyal, but it is disunited as well. Mendi generals and troops generally support Lasana, a fellow Mendi, but other cultures like the Krio and Tenme have found Juxon-Smith a much more affable leader. This is bad enough, but rumors of counter-coups are spreading like wildfire, and Lasana has no interest in giving up his newly won power so soon. If one's thing for sure, it's that Mendi's struggles with the army are not yet over."
 MDI_idea_disorganized_political_spheres: "Disorganized Political Spheres"
 MDI_idea_disorganized_political_spheres_desc: "Coups in the ruins of West Africa are known for a few things. They're quick, they're common, and they're very chaotic. Mendi's latest coup, led by David Lansana, seems to check all three of these boxes. Supporters of all sorts of movements grandstand for their policies in the capital, as Lasana's nascent government struggles to find its footing in a region that's difficult at best to govern.\n\nAdding to the chaos are the numerous leaders of numerous oppositions to Lasana's new regime. From one side, supporters of the deposed former Prime Minister, Milton Margai, remain influential throughout Mendi's local politics. On the other, the people cheer and clap for rising star Siatka Stevens. In the military, generals whisper to each other about the need for a more unifying leader- one they believe they've found in Andrew Juxon-Smith. Everything seems to be pointing to a coming crescendo in Mendi- and as long as the chaos continues, that crescendo will come closer and closer to bursting."

 POLITICS_DAVID_LANSANA_DESC: "When the world trembled under the German panzers and the Japanese battleships, old overlords fell, and new hopeful nations rose in their place, free from the chains that used to bind them. One such nation was the Republic of Sierra Leone, once merely one of the many African colonies of the British Empire, now a fledgling democracy - one that wasn't destined to last. Merely four days after the republic was proclaimed and a democratically elected government was held, the armed forces forcefully seized the capital, led by none other than Brigadier David Lansana.\n\nBorn in 1922 from a prominent Mende family, Lansana was one of the few in Sierra Leone who was selected to undergo military training as an officer in the United Kingdom. Upon returning to his homeland, he married the daughter of a Mende paramount chief - furthering his already extensive network of political connections. When the British hastily retreated from Africa, Lansana became the leader of the Sierra Leonean armed forces. Despite his proclaimed commitment to Sierra Leonean democracy, Lansana had no qualms about couping the government when a party opposed to his clique won in the country's first elections - and now, he stands as the leader of the new, Mendi state that replaced the Republic.\n\nFrom the outset, Lansana's regime was unstable, marred by strong inter ethnic conflicts (which was only exacerbated by the new wave of Mendi nationalism and suprematism), and by the rising power of generals and local warlords formally allied to Lansana, such as general Andrew Juxon-Smith. With Lansana's hold on power growing more and more shaky, and the Mendi economy struggling to pick up speed, it seems like the only reason the general wasn't ousted from power and his tinpot regime removed is that the opposition to his rule isn't unified in a common front - at least for now.
