 iberiawars.2.d:0 "The Basque country revolt had thrown our armed forces in the northern region of the Union into a horrific state of disarray. Only through the quick and effective intervention of civilian officials could the various army units be evacuated from the region without falling to the strength of the rebels. The action has allowed the officers to organise a regrouping which has transformed the weakened forces back into a functional fighting force, albeit a diminished one.\n\nMilitary high command has given strict orders to recapture the lost region by quickly seizing the heartlands of the revolt. Their method of doing such shall be to use the units which had fled to advance in a pincer movement through both Bilbao and Navarra at the same time. In effect this would split the disorganised rebel forces hopefully causing great supply issues, whilst also ensuring an encirclement of a majority of their troops which would lead to their capture at minimal losses. The plan has however been criticised by the senior officers of the reorganised Iberian army units who claim that they simply do not have enough forces to execute the plan in an effective manner. With reinforcements the current problems may be remedied they argue. With the widespread instability across the Union no further troops can however be spared to assist in the mission. With this in mind a hard decision has to hence be made, only one of the pincers can go ahead. Do we either push through Bilbao, which has been judged to likely be the harder affair due to the presence of a majority of the newly formed Basque militias, or go via Navarra, the much longer option which however will have nowhere near the same resistance as Bilbao? With the first plan we could eventually secure a swift and decisive victory but would also risk a devastating loss. The issue with the second is that we ultimately would still need to cross into the Basque region to finish the revolt which may result in us also facing large resistance."

The many Portuguese officials whose loyalty was always to their national identity and Caudillo Salazar first began to grumble as soon as the first reports of the revolt came in. The final straw was triggered when Salazar abandoned all hope of maintaining the sinking ship. Caudillo Salazar attempted to escape Madrid without much fuss but was quickly put under house arrest in his local residence in the Iberian capital. Only with the support of loyal followers was the old man able to stage a successful nighttime getaway.\n\nA mass exodus of Portuguese government officials and military personnel followed, leaving behind an administrative vacuum that Spanish bureaucrats hurriedly attempted to fill. Lisbon has now become a hotbed of revolutionary fervour. The cries for independence and self governance are resonating all across the Union. Salazar's public broadcasts have rallied the Porutgues people to form militia divisions to fight alongside the national army against Unionist forces."

Troops stationed in former Portugal colonies such as Cabo Verde and Guinea-Bissau have also rejected the mantle of Iberian unity in favour of fighting for their old homeland. The regions are now under firm control with Unionist forces yet still unable to recapture them successfully. The former Portuguese empire is enjoying a resurgence despite the instability caused by the Iberian civil war\n\nOne exception, São Tomé y Principe, where local forces felt compelled to fight the war on the frontlines instead of acting as a glorified garrison, has seen resistance to the re-establishment of Portuguese imperial control. Their abandonment of the colony has allowed native resistance cells to act more freely. The situation has given the PAIGC independence movement renewed strength in their previously futile mission. With their leaders sensing the opportunity as good as any to return from exile a bitter guerrilla war has begun to be waged."

The expanding harsh guerrilla campaign fought by the rebels has incentivized the Portuguese government to take action and also withdraw forces from Cabo Verde and Guinea-Bissau. To keep up the occupation would have required continuous resupply and troop reinforcement, something the newly independent country could not afford in its battle for survival on the Peninsula.\n\nSoon after their withdrawal the PAIGC militias entered Bisáu and Praia unopposed, seizing all important administrative and military buildings. It was not long before the rebels seized the initiative and broadcasted their supposed victory over the European colonizers, calling for all patriotic freedom fighters to celebrate their newfound independence. The loss has greatly damaged our prestige even if it was seen as a necessary move by most observers. Unfortunately some in the armed forces did not share this view and have heavily criticized the decision as an act of cowardice. This faction led by general Kaúlza de Arriaga has called for regaining the colonies at the first opportune moment. They have found support and allies in the north of our nation which is known to be a conservative hotbed. Far more worryingly some towns in the region have begun to plead alignment to a movement calling itself the 'Government of National Salvation' which seems to be acting as a direct challenger for authority in Portugal."

With the abandonment however came heightened tensions between the local population and the Iberian administration. It was not long before Orungu troops, who had offered their support to the independence revolt which had been brewing ever since Portugal had seceded, entered the region and quickly forced the remaining colonial soldiers to retreat. Sensing that the situation was beyond repairable the Iberian mission completely abandoned Equatorial Guinea in favour of attempting to salvage the situation on the homefront."

This however had allowed the opportunity for the freedom fighters which had previously been successfully suppressed to finally rise against those who they declared to be their oppressors. Under the name of the São Tomé and Principe Liberation Movement or MLSTP for short the various native groups have come together and forced the remaining Iberian garrisons to surrender without much of a violent confrontation. The guerrillas then promptly entered the regional capital and to a jubilant civilian population publicly declared total independence from the Iberian Union."

Neither seeking profit in the late hours nor making its way to the front, it drove into the Portuguese capital with a single purpose.\n\nFollowing the unfortunate but necessary evacuation of Guinea in order to not get pushed into a protracted colonial conflict and to reinforce the Iberian front with hardened garrison soldiers, a military clique of disgruntled officers had formed. Under the leadership of Kaúlza de Arriaga the conservative cabal was able to influence a number of towns in the north of the country to support the legitimacy of a new administration, the Government of National Salvation. Its mission was to wipe the stain of abandoning the Portuguese imperial holdings from the national consciousness, ensuring that every soldier and citizen could stand side by side pridefully to fight for a strong country. Loyalists to our regime have leaked plans of the clique to attempt to use their newfound support to successfully carry out a putsch. We also know exactly when they plan to execute their mission.\n\nThe driver gasped in surprise and turned quickly to his passengers. Pointing ahead to the side of the road all could see the two tanks and a large number of military personnel checking each lone passerby. With an angry grumble a man at the back of the truck waved for the driver to turn around. 'Let them have it this way,' he thought. 'Portugal and its soul could have been saved with minimal bloodshed.'"

Many are calling for the so-called \"liberation\" of what they perceive as their rightful lands. No doubt, their true goal is to destroy everything we've spent decades building and return to their former barbarous ways.\n\nHowever, many of the more sane amongst them still recognize that a full and immediate break from our influence may prove detrimental to their weak, fledgling state. Indeed, without our control, they may lack the necessary defences to resist other foreign powers. Few want to escape from the frying pan should it mean landing in the fire.\n\nUnderstanding this, Hassan II of Morocco has given us an offer: recognize Morocco's independence and gain an ally, or refuse recognition and remain alone against the revolutionary onslaught.\n\nShould we recognize Morocco, we would gain an immediate ally and prevent the opening of yet another front in this already straining war. However, it is unlikely that this alliance would last long past this conflict's resolution, meaning we'd be deprived of direct access to the nation's industry and resources going forward.\n\nEven still, a war with Morocco would be unwinnable in our current state. Our ability to reconquer the traitorous Moroccan state would hinge entirely on our ability to win the ongoing conflict in Iberia proper, which would be much easier with aid from Morocco.\n\nUltimately, after much deliberation, we've concluded that..."

Chief among these are supporting the Iberians in their war effort and securing our newly gained territories.\n\nProviding the Iberians with aid should prove simple enough as, at least for now, the frontlines are far from the heart of Morocco. This should mean producing weapons, equipment, and supplies will be to no detriment of our own. Of course, transporting these goods securely is another ordeal, but with proper planning it is certainly doable.\n\nSecuring our new territories may prove much more difficult. The edges of our kingdom still remain engulfed in conflict, and many are dissatisfied with our government's collaboration with the Iberian State. As it stands our military is unprepared to deal with an organized insurgency, so the best we can do is prepare and hope beyond hope that the situation does not escalate.\n\nRegardless of these issues, now is a time of celebration for the Moroccan people, as we once more taste true freedom after countless years of subjugation."

Taking inspiration from the anti-spanish and pro-republican sentiments brought about in the initial Rif uprising decades prior, these radicals seek an immediate break from all Iberian influence as well as the abolition of Morocco's long standing monarchy.\n\nThough territorially small in comparison to Morocco proper, the Rif rebels hold key Moroccan port cities as well as a relatively large population given their land area, not to mention that they represent an increasingly popular idea within our own borders.

Shortly afterwards Galicia blocked access to all roads to and from their provinces. Given the rapidly escalating tensions it was perhaps not surprising that the next proclamation to arrive from Santiago was a claim that the interests of Galicia no longer align with those of Madrid and that the only logical course of action was independence.\n\nThe secession of Galicia puts us in a tough spot. While their treachery can not be abided, our resources are already stretched to their breaking point. We can ill afford to open another frontline at this juncture. Luckily it seems like the Galician government is content to remain within their borders.

Their calls for a peaceful solution to the ever growing conflict, despite the growing influence, has entirely fallen on death ears. With the accompanying loss of stability the reformers have begun to entirely lose their faith in fruitful Iberian governance.\n\nIn light of this a number of the politicians have drawn parallels to the Portuguese revolt as a sustainable path to divorce from this mess. Rising to fight for better and more durable ideals than what the current administration wobbles on has to be the only choice. Once the initial plans were set in place intelligence had to be gathered on the level of support a new regime on Spanish would hold.

The three of them were standing over a map of what was once the Iberian Union, with scribbles of what the CIA had thought to be going on within the chaos of the \"Iberia Wars\", or so had the media coverage been calling it. Even still, neither the News nor brass had a good idea of what was going on, and as their forward operating base was among the few to have a semi-accurate map of what Iberia had now looked like, it quickly became apparent that getting a better understanding of the wars would be essential to developing a cohesive plan of action.\n\nThe line cut back into static for a moment, before the voice returned to life. \"Right, you've got what's left of Franco's government in the rough middle of Iberia, from the old border of Portugal to around the Catalans, but that's not exactly looking like it's going to last, and it's stuck between the Republic -that's you, idiots, down there- the ethnic breakaways in Basque...\" Ramsey gestured to the glorified civilian accountant to mark the map down with the half-dry felt marker that they'd forgotten they'd brought along. \"...And in the north, you've got the Falangists, y'know, the fascist guys, they're fighting Franco, too. Over.\" Ramsey felt like he had a migraine coming on.\n\n\"Hold on, hold on a minute, you're saying the fascists are fighting Franco? Over.\" A moment of silence took hold of the radio. The General looked over at the radio, and let out a sigh, as the administrator snickered from across the table, still marking down the border with Catalonia. \"If he says yes, I am going to throw myself out of the window.\" The radio let out a short shriek of static.\n\n\"Yeah, that sounds about right, I think so. Over.\" The General hit his head against the table. \"Good God, how the hell was there ever a union in the first place?\" Ramsey ignored the muttering and scribbled down another note on the status of the Basque."

 USA.1919.d:0 "\"You know how much of a waste that was, ri-\" \"Shut up, shut up, it's working.\" Bob's radio crackled like burning grease over the rumble of the back of the truck, traversing the desolate roads of Spain, and a voice scrawled its way out of the receiver.\n\n\"L... Week, solidifying Presi...\" The words over the airwaves fizzled back into nothing.\n\n\"Oh, sonuvabitch, he said it was legit!\" Dan looked back to Bob alongside Franklin and Michael.\n\n\"The Jap, Bob?\" The truck ran over a pothole, and the small cadre of soldiers rattled around. \"For the last time, he said he wasn't!\"\n\nMichael let out a sigh of disdain, and Franklin opened up a packet of cigarettes. \"We're out in the middle of god-knows-where, Iberia, and this radio -which I got for a rock-bottom price, might I add- isn't working? Who'd have thought, right?\" Dan gave a look and reopened his novel. Bob readjusted the dial on his radio, and couldn't help but wonder if his friends were right. The crackle subsided for a moment, and Il Caudillo's voice broke through the static. Thanking God for his Spanish lessons in his teenage years, Dan listened in on the broadcast.\n\n\"...mended to the wires. Once done, you can safely fire the rifle. On the subject of treating burns, one must remember to be calm and to keep your first aid on hand at all times. Taking out the...\"\n\n\"Jesus, you guys hearing this stuff?

 USA.1920.t:0 "충분하지 않은 붕대"
 USA.1920.d:0 "A young man came to the doctor's aid, as the doctor forced him to press both of his palms into the bleeding chest of another man, screaming in agony after being hit by shrapnel from an explosive. The soldier was on the ground, with nothing protecting his wounds from infection. Doctor Lewis knew the man wouldn't make it, he was losing too much blood too quickly, and so he left the terrified young man with the dying soldier to tend to the others that he could save. Ten, twenty, thirty, fifty, a hundred, two hundred, he counted. Too much, too little time, too little equipment. His train of thought was abruptly cut as he had unknowingly tripped on a man's legs, falling down to the puddle of blood beside the man. Without hesitation, he threw his body closer to the man on the ground, his coat turning into the brown color of the mud.\n\n\"Where are the bandages!?\" He screamed at the general direction of the people around him, \"This man has an open wound!\" But nobody turned to look at him, his shouts were drowned by the sounds of screaming and the obnoxious splashing of footsteps that riddle the vicinity. And with nobody else available around, he ripped a sizable portion of his now dirty coat and wrapped it around the man's left leg multiple times, covering a hole an inch wide, as the piece of cloth turned from brown to red.\n\n\"You're in trauma and in shock, but please, sit up and press this with both of your hands,\" the doctor said tensely. The man was a Spaniard, and didn't understand a single word that Doctor Lewis said, so the doctor forcefully sat him up and placed the soldier's hands on the cloth. The man roared out in pain as he did.\n\n\"This is for your own good.... Lo siento,\" with his limited knowledge in Spanish, he apologized. He then stood up, leaving the soldier on the ground once again, and this time, he searched for the bandages himself, so that he may treat the next patient properly."

 USA.1921.d:0 "\"And that's when it turned out, the thing didn't even fit! We must've tried it hundreds of times but in the end-\" Private West's story was cut off with a rough hand to the back of the head, the closest thing American Infantry in Iberia received to affection. His tale about his time back in the city was met with a chorus of 'stop bullshitting' and 'shut your mouth' from the rest of the jeep. His helmet had gone over his eyes, but he was more focused on protesting either way. \"I'm serious guys! Hone-\"\n\nHis vision totally blocked, he didn't even see it coming. Just the woosh of the rocket, and the explosion as their transport turned into a fireball.\n\nMerrell West didn't know how he ended up on the ground, or where his helmet had gone, but that didn't matter. He stared up the cliffside they had been driving along, where he could still see the slight trail that the rocket had made going downhill, directly onto their position. The same position that was still a smoking wreck of jeep and man. He stood, trembling, only to immediately regret his decision.\n\n\"Get your head down private!\" The corporal was a brick wall of a man, and being tackled by him had only reinforced that comparison. Just in the nick of time too, Merrell felt the dirt and rocks kicked up by a spray of bullets just over his head, where he had been standing not a second ago. \"You got a deathwish or something?\" The Corporal had grabbed Merrell's head, turning it in his direction so that Private West could get the full spittle-in-the-face experience as orders were barked. \"Stay in the smoke! Crawl away!\" And just like that, he pushed Merrel backwards by his face, sending the young man sprawling behind him.\n\nMerrell had to crawl away from the road, following a subtle trail left behind of marks from where knees were dragging underneath the smoke, boots had gone, and where brush and grass had been disturbed. There might have been a half-dozen others, at most, limping their way off the road and to safety, wherever safety might be."

 USA.1922.d:0 "\"So did Sergeant Bratwurst choose this spot? Or maybe it was General Sushi?\" Rudy had not taken his hand off his rifle since they'd gotten here. The other six members of his squad had already taken their seats along the crest of the hill that had been selected for them, but Rudy still stood, must have been for twelve hours straight at this point, between the mission they'd just completed and waiting for evac.\n\nAlex, for his part, had his eyes glued to the clear blue skies up above, ears peeled for the familiar thrumming of the helicopter blades. \"What's your griping about? You know we gotta be out in the open for the helis to see us.\"\n\n\"And if the helis can see us, so can the enemy. From all sides too, given our position.\"\n\nTerrence, the Squad Leader, gave a brief chuff of laughter. \"The enemy is that way, Rudy.\" He pointed back down the road, in the direction they came. \"And we blocked that road off.\"\n\nRudy shook his head, his arm trembled, and Alex stood up, hand reaching towards his gun. \"You aren't listening.\" Rudy spoke with a shiver, eyes glancing the opposite direction, down the road ahead. \"You hear the gunshots up there? Yeah? The artillery? That doesn't sound like ours.\"\n\nThe squad went silent as the grave as they listened ahead. He wasn't wrong either. In this area, the Americans had the heaviest artillery, even at this distance, it was obvious that what was firing up ahead was much smaller, much lighter.\n\n\"The lines moved back while we were gone.\" Trevor fretted, shuddering as he stood and brought his gun up to his shoulder. He was the first to lift his gunbarrel as well, turning his back to the middle of the group and rubbernecking side to side.\n\n\"And evac should've been here by now...\" Matthew added, entirely unhelpful as he went back to back with Trevor, his own gun aimed towards the sky.\n\nOne by one, the isolated Americans found themselves with their backs to one another, in various states of standing and kneeling, far further behind enemy lines than they had even known. Minutes felt like years as the Iberian sun beat down on those seven men, waiting to see whether death or deliverance would find them first."

 jap.2041.t:0 "경치 구경"
 jap.2041.d:0 "The small port city had become a good deal more cosmopolitan in the last few weeks. For the most part, the tiny handful of Iberians were gone, as the nomadic Berbers of the interior moved north towards their settled cousins and the Arabs in the cities. And then of course, there were all the soldiers of fortune, and the Japanese 'advisors', a group which included Private Nosaka.\n\nNosaka was on leave one particular day, and decided to take in as much of the city as he could, staying within the safe zones. Moroccan ordinance was not particularly accurate, and it had not done significant damage to any key infrastructure, but Nosaka imagined that would be cold comfort for those who now lived without homes. Less so for those who no longer lived. He could feel a palpable sense of tension wherever he went, even if he didn't understand the words spoken. Much like had been the case in the 1920s, interior nomads still formed the core of the Rifian military. Their hard faces regarded the city with suspicion. The positions, angles, terrain, all different to what they were used to. They regarded who Nosaka assumed to be Arabs with considerable suspicion. The Arabs, for their part, glared right back at them and some shouted, but little violence had occurred so far. So far.\n\nAs the siege continued, Nosaka noticed the markets slowly shrink and become abandoned, as the lines for Japanese and Red Crescent food packages grew larger and larger. The livestock brought into the city by some of the nomads became gradually more emaciated. However, Nosaka was still eating okay, and nobody seemed to be starving. For now."

 jap.2042.d:0 "Kentaro and the rest of the engineering company moved into the town at the light of dawn. A major battle between the Rif and Morocco was expected in the coming days, leaving precious little time to build the necessary fortifications- especially if they planned to get out before the shooting started.\n\nHe did not know the village's name. He only knew that a light Moroccan garrison had been cleared out recently, and the town had been 'cleared of traitors' shortly after. Kentaro had some grim ideas about what that might have meant, but all he saw upon entering the town was stillness. No people came out to greet them, or walked the streets, and even animals could not be seen. The wind did not move, and the low rumble of the trucks was the only sound to be heard. They moved into the empty square, and began to survey the position.\n\nHours of digging and dragging followed, as trenches were dug, pillboxes were constructed and guns were moved into place. Kentaro's shovel plowed through the soil, until it made contact with something which was not soil. Minutes of scraping followed, and the whole sight became apparent. Decomposing limbs lay limp across tattered heaps of ruined cloth, forming an indistinguishable mound of flesh. Men, women, children. One of the privates threw up, and the rest stared in shock for a few seconds. Then they moved on, and continued with their task. They had a job to do, and the corpses were creating a hole in the defensive line.A couple of hours later, the task was finished, and the perimeter was established. Unknown bodies rotted in a muddled heap outside the town, safely out of the way."

 jap.2043.d:0 "\"There's nothing more we can do, Keiichi. We need to go now.\"\n\nMurano Keiichi couldn't help but grimace, glancing at the absolute disgraceful work of a defense they've built up around this particular village, the glance of the Rif soldiers as uncertain as the man were, and well..., if any of his instructors in the IJA were here to see this, they would scream his ear off and send him back to boot camp for the sheer disgrace this fortification would be.\n\nBarely hidden mines and razor wires stretched across the acrid, dry floor, while a backline made of hastily dug together trenches, held by few wooden planks, and genuine faith. Behind, the village was also booby-trapped, the citizens evacuated and each home locked as both a fort against external invasion, but in his machine, also massive deathtraps, with the amount of ammunition and explosives being set on it. He wishes he could do more, something smarter, more meaningful, but he knew in advance his work was one to constantly set up diversions, to the rampaging forces behind them.\n\nMurano's unit felt like rats, constantly chased by a persistent, immortal cat, and each trap and fortification they've set up was more half-assed, brittle than the next one until it would finally be caught up with them...but what could they do? Murano glanced tiredly at his lieutenant, giving a short nod, and a pitying glance at the Rif units behind him, underequipped and underprepared for what's going to come, only the fire in their eyes, or perhaps desperation, was any amount of edge they would have.\n\nBy morning, their squadron was hundreds of miles away, the sounds of gunfire echoing softly in the distance.\n\nBy evening, there wouldn't be any village near Amezrou anymore, only rising pillars of smoke the sign of any life that community ever had."

 jap.2044.d:0 "Mounir was grateful for any military assistance he could get, though he wished the process was a deal less kafkaesque. The Japanese colonel would speak in Japanese, his interpreter would translate to Arabic, and then he would deliver it to the men in Berber. This process caused considerable confusion, and a good deal of time was wasted clarifying misunderstandings, or puzzling over technical terms which had yet to receive any kind of direct Berber translation. Still, it was unavoidable given the circumstances, and the men did seem to be learning something.\n\nOn this particular day, the colonel was furiously tapping away with his pointer at the large map, explaining the finer points of mountain supply routes and defences, while the Arabic translator and Mounir struggled to keep up. Even as his mind raced between two languages, however, he found a lot of the advice given to be a little strange. He understood the importance of safeguarding resources and industry to maintain an army, but the Japanese seemed to place an emphasis on mineral deposits which bordered on the tactically unsound. Many were not even developed, and the Moroccans could afford to lose men over them in a way the Rifians could not.\n\nThen there was the flat, dispassionate tone which the Japanese always seemed to possess. They seemed like extremely distant people. There was very little fraternizing between the Rifians and the Japanese, and the only times where they seemed to leave their barracks was to engage in this mad dance of tapping at maps and cycling through tongues. All in all, Mounir wasn't certain why they'd taken an interest in this fledgling nation. They didn't have any resources that Japan didn't already have in abundance, and Morocco posed no threat to Asia. Something bigger had to be at foot, but Mounir didn't have the time or patience to comprehend it."
