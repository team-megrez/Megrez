 msk_dissolution_news.0.desc: "Following the recent chaos through the entire continent of Europe, Moskowien had faced disaster as well, with central control being erased by warlordism similar to what exists in the rest of the former Soviet Union. However, this has been ended now, with order being restored by former collaborationist governor of Oryol, Mikhail Gorbachev, declaring the Russian Democratic Republic, under the rule of the SNS.\n\nA confusing path of events lead to Gorbachev controlling Moskowien, details of which are still unclear. All the important people from the cabinet - Chernayev, Shutova, Knopmus, and Vorobyov, have been present at the declaration of the Republic. What is known now is that the current government, while led by collaborators, is quite ideologically separate from their masters in the Reich: the promise has been made of democracy, rebuilding the country and fair cooperation with the Reich; the future is planned, but unclear.\n"

 msk_dissolution_news.1.desc: "News out of the ill-fated German colony of Moskowien had been sparse at best ever since the disappearance of Reichskommissar Kasche, but it appears that, for better or worse, the situation may be stabilizing. Russian collaborationist forces commanded by Bronislav Kaminski reportedly have succeeded in restabilising the former colony after several months of brutal fighting with other hostile factions. The self-proclaimed \"Helmsman\" of the new Russian state announced his intentions in a televised speech, claiming that \"a new era of prosperity, free from Judeo-Bolshevik trickery, dawns for the New Russia\".\n\nThe implications of this outcome are currently unclear, but the sordid reputation of the NSPR and their infamous commander precedes them. With this aspiring dictator now at the helm of the entire region, the fate of Moskowien's long-suffering people still looks as grim as ever.\n"
 msk_dissolution_news.2.desc: "Moskowien was long thought to be a land of rot and decay, her inevitable collapse all but assured by the passage of time. Much like her sister, it collapsed into warring feuds as the Fatherland collapsed in civil war, clouding the region in a mist of uncertainty, much like the rest of Eastern Europe. However, the dust has settled and the smoke parted, and the one that picked her pieces together seems to be neither the Motherland's native, nor her colonizer's sympathizers, but Dietrich von Saucken.\n\nAn interesting individual, a faithful believer in Prussian values long since thought lost to modern Germany, von Saucken spoke publicly of a Moskowien that shall not find herself ever disorded, or ever afraid again, as he formed a hastily scrambled military junta to lord over Moskowien for the time being. As the rest of Eastern Europe seems to rage on in her conflicts, it seems the Reichskommissariat has found in herself a relic of the past as her caretaker.\n"
 msk_dissolution_news.3.desc: "It seems the smoke has cleared on the Reich's Russian state, and from the collapse of the Reichskommissariat, Helldorff's state rules as the sole survivor of the crisis. A committed National Socialist, a member of the NSDAP since its founding, Helldorff seems to have proven that, despite the chaos burning Germania and the rest of the holdings, the grip National Socialism has on the state that borders its eternal foes is still as strong, and short-leashed as ever.\n\nIn a public speech, Helldorff praised the Aryan for \"guiding the destiny of this land to greatness\" and that in time, Moskowien wouldn't be looked at just as the line of defense against the Russian warlords, but as a prime example of German colonization, on the lines of her similarly-afflicted sister, Ostland; regardless of international opinion, one question can simply ring in everyone's consciousness...\n"
 msk_dissolution_news.4.desc: "Stunning, yet fitting news seems to come from the Bulwark of the Reich. On the chaos gripping the heart of Europe, has the grasp of the Reich towards the former Russian territories weakened, and it wasn't the Reich's collaborators that seized control of the former territory of Moskowien, but a complete dark horse, borne out of the myriad statelets brought upon by the civil war.\n\nWhile international observers note how the independence of the new government will not last for long, short of the collapse of Germany itself, this is nonetheless a critical blow to the belief of the Reich's control within their territories.\n"
