The revolutionary rabble of the mob will not bring success; instead, strong leadership is needed to guide them - the strong leadership of the Kuomintang.

During his tenure from 1924 to 1926, the economy of Guangzhou grew greatly and much of the credit went to Song's modern economic management.

With the return of the Kuomintang to power, this time in China's wealthy east coast, his expertise has been sought and he has returned to prominence.

He then participated in the Work-Study Programme where he worked in French factories but in 1921, he left France to study at the Chemical Engineering Department at the Université du Travail in Belgium.

In 1919, he went to France as part of the Work-Study Programme along with Cai Hesen and Li Weihan where he helped found the \"Engineering World Society\". When the Beiyang Government discovered that the students of the Work-Study Programme held anti-government tendencies, they demanded the immediate repatriation of these students; however, the new revolutionary French government refused to comply. Nonetheless, Guo Chuntao along with other revolutionaries departed for China in 1923, when Guo joined the Chinese Kuomintang.\n\nBy 1926, during the Northern Expedition, Guo was a member of the Central Committee - ironically, however, the expedition's failure brought him back to France. In exile, Guo has found allies and comrades within the Reorganised Comrades Association especially due to many of them sharing similar labour and syndicalist backgrounds.

His father cast a long shadow over him in his early life as they moved around, and in 1924 the idealistic Chiang Ching-kuo was now able to present to his father, then headmaster of Whampoa Military Academy, a proposal concerning organising the rural population of Haikou. Ching-Kuo became enamoured with the idea of being seen as a so-called \"Progressive Revolutionary\", and looked towards the recently established Commune of France for inspiration.\n\nWith help from the French-educated party elder Wu Zhihui, Chiang received permission from his father to travel abroad. In France, Chiang received a great revolutionary education and joined a syndicalist youth league along with his fellow Chinese classmate Deng Xiaoping. Unfortunately, however, in February 1927 the young Chiang received news that the Northern Expedition had failed and that his father was assassinated in its aftermath.\n\nWith no home to return to, Chiang Ching-kuo remained with the Chinese expatriate community in France, where he also encountered those military cadets from Whampoa that had returned from the war, heavily dissatisfied with parliamentary politics.

When he reached Beijing, he applied to study in France and arrived there in 1920, on the eve of the Revolution.

However, in China's darkest hour, it was the Generalissimo who along with the glorious cadets and soldiers of the Whampoa Military Academy that have saved China from destruction by both foreign and domestic threats.\n\n In order to preserve the revolution, the principle of obedience to the supreme leader must be followed. Hu Zongnan is the Kuomintang's only supreme leader and also China's only great leader; therefore members in the Party must absolutely support him, follow his orders only, and make his will their own. Obedience to the leader is unconditional. One must live and die with him, sincerely, unwaveringly - just as martyrs died for the late leader Sun Yat-sen. The youth of China, imbued with the follies of European syndicalism and liberalism have emphasised the individual, considering veneration of an idol as backward. But this is wrong, for the idol of the Party helps develop national culture and unifies the trust of the mass spirit. We cannot deny that the Party needs a Mussolini, it needs a Savinkov to guide it to glory - and in our Lingxiu Hu Zongnan, we will be able to achieve salvation for our nation!"

But it was the great Dr. Sun Yat-sen who theorised that the notion of Minzu from the Three Principles of the People was necessary to prevent the nation from falling into disorder and chaos. Interestingly enough, his earlier opinions seemed to encourage the notion of a dominant Han ethnicity. But as evident from his declaration at the 1924 reorganisation of the Kuomintang, Sun proclaimed that the Kuomintang's anti-imperialist mission also included securing self-determination for all \"domestic minzu.\" But the notion of Minzu itself is disputed as Sun considers the great races of Qing China (aside from the Han majority), the Tibetans, Mongols, Manchus, and Hui, as mere relics of an ancient social structure.\n\nInstead, the late premier's stance was that the Minzu of China were all subordinate to the ethnically dominant \"Hanzu\" (Han ethnicity). It was, therefore, the more cultured and sophisticated Hanzu's destiny to lead the Minzu into the evolutionary formation of a single Han Zhonghua Minzu. In the National Revolution, all notions of self-determination were to be suspended until the period of tutelage is passed as the country's Minzu are merely inept to rule themselves.\n\nThe Repatriated Congress, in particular Wang Jingwei's faction, is mostly in favour of following Sun's principles. Nonetheless, the Provisional Action Committee has voiced openly that they would be more than happy to promise a degree of self-autonomy for the minorities, provided they support the KMT of course. While a Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has been formed, the official doctrine of the said department is to train these peoples to adopt the revolutionary spirit of the superior Hanzu Kuomintang.

Widely respected among the left, he has continued to nurse lasting wounds from a brutal assassination attempt in 1925. It seems that he has finally succumbed to those wounds, though thankfully lived long enough to see the party return from its exile.\n\nAs his funeral concludes near Nanjing, his personal effects are not the only things being divided.

The position of Vice Chairman of the CEC, a position specially created for him during the exile period, has gone to Song Qingling - helping preserve the balance of power within the party.\n\nRemaining in contention however, is the title of Premier of the Executive Yuan. The nominal head of the executive branch, it was freshly created during the League War as a replacement for the old Beiyang prime minister. Liao hardly had any time to utilise it however, leaving executive power effectively in the hands of the nominally weak Presidency. To Wang, the job was meant as a means of personally recognising Liao's contributions. To his rivals in the PAC, it represented a necessary counterweight to the Chairman as Liao was seen as more conciliatory.\n\nWang is determined to avoid having to split executive prerogatives, fearing the perils of a powerless President vulnerable to political machinations. As President of the Republic, it is in his right to appoint the Premier, and Chen Gongbo is the most logical candidate. A loyal protege, friend, and the leader of the RCA, his candidacy is troubled by his personal radicalism and the fact that Wang needs him elsewhere.

His blunder is highlighted by the fact that it is not only the PAC and RF that have decried the move - many of the RCA's Moderates have been enraged and driven closer to the PAC's camp. Even among the RCA's radicals, there has been some stir, with Chen Gongbo rumoured to be fuming at Wang's decision to pass him over for the job.\n\nCaucuses within the Kuomintang are not well-defined, with the state being officially one party and factionalism de jure banned. But it certainly has not been good for Wang's camp - with blood now in the water and the Chairman appearing vulnerable for the first time, many have come out to knock him down a peg. Any attempt to force his resignation is unlikely to succeed at this juncture, but he has hurried to try and salvage the situation by tentatively offering to appoint Gu Mengyu, the most prominent RCA-Moderate leader, as his Premier in exchange for a political truce.\n\nThe onus now lies in the PAC to make their move. Word of this offer has quickly leaked and spread, though for Song Qingling and her allies it might not be good enough. Having an RCA member in the position would be a victory for the Chairman regardless and with his statesmanship he'll likely reconcile the Moderates soon enough. But openly holding out until a candidate from their quasi-illegal opposition camp may disgust the wavering RCA-Moderates, turning their anger towards PAC obstructionism and validating Wang's fears of partisanship. The party's future hangs in the balance."

 CHI.midgame.010.d: "Ever since Dr. Sun declared himself Generalissimo and the Kuomintang lurched towards a vanguardist direction, questions of constitutionalism, checks and balances, and power sharing have always been a sore spot for the ostensibly democratic party. His often bickering successors have not helped their case, struggling to keep the party together even with such extra-constitutional powers.\n\nWang Jingwei is the latest to assert his unchecked authority for the duration of the political tutelage. And with the Premiership crisis having failed to be quietly resolved within the halls of power, it has since reached the ears of the public. As the scandal continues to dog the party, support has largely bottomed out as the people return to their usual apathy - the KMT are little better than the squabbling Beiyang politicians.\n\nBack in the CEC, the stand-off between RCA and PAC oriented factions continues. Sun Fo and the Reconstruction Faction, whether because of political shrewdness or fears of instability, have offered to break from the PAC-lead blockade. Sun Fo, already Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan (a position created for him), has \"generously\" offered to become Premier with Gu Mengyu as his deputy. This would hardly fix the underlying problems that the dispute has exposed, but with the PAC showing no indications of giving up, this will at least allow Wang to move on for now.\n\nDiscarding this chance to \"off-ramp\" is not an ideal option either. Throughout this crisis, Wang has been forced to acknowledge the Premiership as at least a distinct job albeit with ambiguous powers and given up from directly abolishing it. Chen Gongbo, slighted but still loyal, has concocted a plan with the reluctant assent of the RCA-Moderates - tired of the unabating crisis. Wang will appoint himself as Premier, holding the Presidency and Premiership simultaneously during the tutelage. The RCA will use every dirty trick in their arsenal to ram it through the provisional legislature and Wang use his powers as commander-in-chief to silence dissent. Their bluff called, the PAC will be forced to fold for the sake of the nation."

 CHI.midgame.011.d: "While denounced as an autocratic clique, the Chairman of the Kuomintang Wang Jingwei's camp boasts one of the largest factions within the Party. Those that make up his support base within the government include both the Residence Faction and the Reorganised Comrades Association (RCA). As such his \"clique\" features its own internal power struggle, as the various factions vy for Wang's favour and approval.\n\nThe Residence Faction (derisively called the Palace Faction by Wang's critics), are those who reside with the Chairman in his mansion. The main voice of the Residence Faction is none other than Wang's wife, the ambitious and strong-willed Chen Bijun - who is nicknamed by those within the RCA as \"Wang Furen\" (Madame Wang) or \"Laotaipo\" (the old woman, due to her looking older than her husband). A loving couple, she often has her husband's ear and protects his interests even when he is unwilling to do so himself. Additional members of this faction include Chu Minyi (married to Chen Bijun's adopted sister), Zeng Zhongming (Wang's most trusted secretary), Zeng Xing (Zeng Zhongming's sister), Wang Wenxun (Wang Jingwei's third daughter), and Chen Yaozu (Chen Bijun's brother). They are also joined by Wang Qi and Wang Zongzun (Wang's nephews) and Chen Chunpu (Chen Bijun's nephew).\n\nBitterly opposing the Chairman's wife is none other than the Chairman's beloved friend - Chen Gongbo, who is the de-facto voice of the RCA - Wang's political followers in the KMT. Nonetheless, Chen and his followers form the Radical wing of the RCA, his pro-authoritarian materialist stances are joined in conjunction with his belief that class war is inevitable in China. He is joined by followers such as Shi Cuntong, Wang Faqin, Liu Kanyuan, Gu Zhengang, and Gu Zhengding.\n\nThose who refuse to adopt Chen's Marxist-oriented world-view and are generally more moderate in their discourse, are the RCA-Moderates led by Gu Mengyu. While a significantly smaller faction, Gu nonetheless holds influence as being one of Wang's most favourite writers and the Moderates themselves agree that a Reorganisation of the Kuomintang is needed to purify the revolution. Joining Gu in the Moderate camp are Pan Yunchao, Wang Leping, Lin Bosheng, and Zhu Jiqing."

 CHI.midgame.012.d: "\"We should follow Dr. Sun's Principles. What we need now is action and the people to take action,\" announced Song Qingling at the creation of the Provisional Action Committee (PAC). A development of the earlier populist MinGan Government, the PAC is devoted to the cause of establishing a socialist and free China - one devoid of imperialism, warlords, and greedy landlords.\n\nTo the PAC, the Chinese revolution is complex, with the revolutionary characteristics of a military rebellion, of civil rights, of democracy, and of socialism. Members of PAC adhere to the Marxist ideas of historical materialism, they are convinced that China is headed towards a socialist future and that the common people (pingmin) would assume leadership in this new order. The society of the future would be built on the active participation of the masses of common people. Due to the complex nature of PAC's beliefs, they maintain a shaky relationship with the Reconstruction Faction, the World Society, the Chinese Syndicalist Party, and even members of Wang Jingwei's Reorganised Comrades Association.\n\nWhile PAC members agree with the Reconstruction Faction (RF) on the nature of eventual democracy, to them the RF is nothing more than the representation of bourgeois interests which will tarnish the actual revolution that is to be led by the Chinese commoners. They see those in the RCA as mere lackeys to an authoritarian Chairman, and while they indeed hold similar grass-roots and socialist views as their syndicalist and anarchist counterparts, more conservative PAC members have reservations regarding the Third Internationale's role in the world revolution.\n\nLed by the dynamic Deng Yanda and the charismatic widow Madame Song Qingling, the PAC does not advocate orthodox Sunism but rather the improvement and development the Three Principles of the People to make them more concrete and practical to meet the needs of the people. Their intellectual flexibility is what allows them to court these various factions, from syndicalists to liberals, while also maintaining their own goal of a democratic and socialist China."

 CHI.midgame.013.d: "As the largest faction and movement within the League of Chinese Syndicalists, the Chinese Syndicalist Party boasts the most union membership and followers in China. With inspiration from the glorious revolutions of Britain and France following the Great War, the Old Guard of the Chinese Syndicalists such as party members Chen Duxiu, Li Lisan, and Liu Shaoqi believe that in order for the proletarian socialist revolution to happen - the national revolution must be won first. When the Kuomintang was reorganised in 1924, the syndicalists and the Kuomintang worked together in a pledge of unity - the so called United Front.\n\nIdeally the Orthodox Syndicalists of the CSP envision a system akin to the Commune of France, with unions and councils working together in tandem. The ongoing civic and political turmoil of the French state however has led to doubts towards the leadership of the orthodox CSP. Within the LCS, criticism has come from groups ranging from the anarchists to the Radical Faction of the CSP, regarding cooperation with the Chinese Kuomintang. To Chen Duxiu, the \"all-class\" revolution is the only form of revolution possible for the proletariat at this stage in time.\n\nThe policy of the United Front had been successful in organising both the failed 1932 Shanghai Uprising and the NRA's success in the League War. Nonetheless, the Orthodox Faction find themselves pulled at the hems with the Kuomintang's own factional struggle splitting the LCS' tense coalition. There is little doubt that the elders of the World Society are certainly closer to the PAC in beliefs and that the Radicals of the CSP find common ground with the radicals of the RCA. As the LCS begins to unravel into infighting once more, the Orthodox Faction has a choice: to side with one of the major factions of the Kuomintang, or to continue their course of independence from Nationalist party politics."

He is a faceless man, deliberately wearing a drab, monotonous outfit calculated to prevent the man from standing out as he conducts the \"labour of hound and horse\" as he so calls it. He carries with him a proposition from his master.\n\nInside is one of the fledging Republic's most eminent figures, perhaps the third most influential figure in the old MinGan insurgency. The circumstances are grim and he shoos out his hand-picked guards from the meeting room. He is not fooled by his guest's act, watching the man's wolfish eyes dart around for weakness as he speaks.\n\nIn the paranoid atmosphere that permeates the land, conspiracies and furtive meetings are all too common. But this perhaps eclipses all others in its scale - a plot against the leader of the very party they claim to serve. Dai Chunfeng, the guest, begins by reminding General Deng Yanda of their common struggle together in the insurgency, which soon devolves into a rant about how the Paris Committee has swooped in to steal all the glory despite hiding in safety for nearly a decade. He insists he and other officers are willing to fight to protect the revolution from Wang's folly and proposes an alliance with unspecified conditions against him. He is already armed with potential areas of coordination between their respective factions.\n\nDeng is quick to show his annoyance at Dai equating his efforts to those of the insurgency barely concealing his disdain for the former gangster. He is well aware who Dai serves - Hu Zongnan and his clique have long been undermining Deng's authority within the army. But as the Chairman's power grows, the threat of tyranny hangs over the nation and there is some temptation towards the use of \"special methods\" to keep the RCA at bay. As the veteran general stares down the \"officer\" who failed to graduate Whampoa with flaring contempt, he nonetheless contemplates his own labour of hound and horse for Song Qingling and the PAC."

 CHI.midgame.015.d: "The hound has long slipped from its leash, a fact that many within the Kuomintang central leadership have come to regret. The National Revolutionary Army, a force designed specifically to protect the party from warlord and military control, has slowly developed a mind of its own, and rumours of military conspiracies swirl as each faction courts sympathetic officers.\n\nWang Jingwei is no stranger to this threat, and neither are those closest to him. Although Wang has substantial control over the bureaucracy, the support of at the least plurality of intellectuals and Chen Gongbo has whipped his RCA into a disciplined (albeit unofficial) caucus, his position at the top of the party has never felt quite secure.\n\nHis wife, Chen Bijun, has a plan. A determined woman, with painful memories of the power-struggle her husband had with Chiang Kai-shek, knows all too well the power of the military in dictating party priorities. She has independently begun the legwork for creating a pro-Chairman military faction, something that she has finally informed Wang in detail. With the help of Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Enlai, and the advisors of the MMIC, she has drafted a list of members of the Political Department, the European-trained syndicalist officers, and other young guard loyalists to install into key positions in the NRA hierarchy.\n\nSuch blatant meddling in the army might be just enough to bring the military to heel, breaking their independent political spirit. On the other hand, Wang is hesitant despite Chen's rosy outlook, noting that many NRA officers are genuinely apolitical and such open demands of political loyalty may backfire by driving them into the opposition. Chen's open efforts to install her brother Chen Changzu as a general in the air force has caused plenty of blowback in the past. Presenting an image of being a respectable statesman above such petty bickering might be the better route to keep his power. Then again, revolution is often a dirty business and as President and Commander-in-Chief it is his right to grant military commissions. Perhaps it is better to be feared than overthrown."

 CHI.midgame.016.d: "Long respected amongst Chinese leftists for organising Chinese workers and students in the Diligent Work-Study Programme, the Four Elders of the Kuomintang hold an eclectic view of anarchism and its role within the Kuomintang. Li Shizeng, one of the Elders of the World Society, has proposed that the Kuomintang adopt a federation based on Proudhon's principle - this federation would be a combination of local and central governments with the goal of decentralising power to regional bodies. However, given the political situation of China, a degree of central authority (military power, finances, and heavy industries) would still be in government hands until anarchism was achieved.\n\nThe anarchists of the Kuomintang aim to construct a Labour University akin to those in Europe, where a new kind of labour leader and intellectual would be created - legendary organisers who would transform not just the Party but rather the nation. With the help of their newspaper, \"Revolutionary Weekly\", they would propagate anarchist ideals and argue that Sun's Three Principles of the People was by default - a way to create anarchism.\n\nIn the latest article of Revolutionary Weekly, the fiery elder Wu Zhihui denounced Chairman Wang and the RCA for \"inciting class struggle\", arguing that Dr. Sun's revolution called for all of China to rise up - as evident by the declaration made in the First Congress of 1924. To Wu, the revolution was \"quanmin geming\" (revolution for all people). However, RCA members have denounced this terminology on the basis that it is used by the counter-revolutionary Chinese Youth Party in the North. To the RCA, by using counter-revolutionary language - Wu assented the repudiation of social transformation as part of the National Revolution, which was considered ironic for an anarchist.\n\nFurther criticism has come from Chen Gongbo, who has decided to draft an open letter to the Revolutionary Weekly. In his letter, he argued that the World Society seemed to enjoy their official positions as elders within the Party and spent most of their time courting the influential military leaders of the Provisional Action Committee. To Wu and Li Shizeng, whom he once may have idolised, he has growing doubts about their commitment to the revolution - especially with regard to their lack of belief in class struggle. The only solution, according to him, was for them to resign their positions immediately and for the rest of the KMT to dismiss their ideas as folly."

 CHI.midgame.017.d: "Within the Party, one of the most common means of inter-factional bickering comes in newspapers and pamphlets from respective cliques to demonstrate their supposedly better understanding of Chinese society and history. Of the most popular newspapers read by Party members are Chen Gongbo's \"The Revolutionary Critic,\" Gu Mengyu's \"Advance,\" and Sun Fo's \"Reconstruction Review.\"\n\nChen Gongbo's Revolutionary Critic features a collaboration of writers within the RCA's most radical wings, including Shi Cuntong, Guo Chuntao, and Xu Deheng. Their writings mainly deal with their desire to see the Party reorganised and restructured once more, a more complete \"Reorganisation\" than the 1924 party reshuffle. To them, the revolution must be led by cadre of revolutionary intellectuals, and the masses must be drawn  as they are the true vanguard of the national revolution. The Critic's writings deal with mostly scientific and Marxist terms, with writers like Chen frequently using words such as materialism to dictate their thought processes.\n\nGu Mengyu's \"Advance\" shows that Gu and his followers were well-read on Marxism, but they rejected the notion that Marxism was scientific or historical - instead they call  for a similar reorganisation expressed by Chen and his followers but with less radical means. To Gu, there is no need for a \"class base\" of the Party as Chinese society had not yet developed into a class society - instead, the KMT should represent \"all oppressed peoples.\"\n\nSun Fo's Reconstruction Review differed in the Reorganisationists in that the writers of the Review argue that the KMT should not be reorganised but rather reconstructed. To these writers, the KMT has been tainted since the United Front, and the RCA-Radicals merely echoed the tenets of Marxism rather than adhering to the orthodox theory of Sun Yat-sen. Furthermore, they also disagree with PAC, seeing PAC's populism and PAC's flexibility in working with syndicalists as a potential threat to the National Revolution's success."

Infighting among party cadres has long been accepted as a political reality, though at times it can reach the point of paranoia. Accusations of reactionary thought or subverting the Three Principles is unfortunately common practice, but now it seems like a new round of hysteria is starting.\n\nAlthough the Yiguandao movement may be associated with Shandong province, its adherents can be found throughout China. At the 1929 Party Congress, the Kuomintang resolved that none of its members could also belong to any charismatic spiritual movements, chief among them being the cult lead by Mad Mystic Zhang Tianran. Spurred on by a rumour, an extensive counter-intelligence sweep has ensnared one secret Millenarian of high party status: Zhou Fohai.\n\nZhou is a friend and close associate of Wang Jingwei, and it is sometimes said that his government runs on \"Chen Gongbo's mouth, Zhou Fohai's pen and Chu Minyi's legs\". Despite this, he is personally unpopular within Wang's camp, not a devout member of the RCA and estranged from the Residence Faction, and said to be disillusioned with socialism. As word spreads, the PAC has worked to spin it to their advantage, insinuating that Wang has allowed treason to flourish right under his nose.\n\nZhou for his part has thoroughly denied any wrongdoing and claims he has ended his association with the Yiguandao years ago. He has begged the Chairman to protect him and has let slip a few thinly-veiled threats to denounce his rival Chu Minyi as another Yiguandao member, worsening the scandal. He says that Dai Chunfeng's agents have already made several enticing offers to shield him and give him a job doing \"research\" for them. But he knows that Wang will do right by him and bury the investigation, publicly exonerating him before the party. In exchange, he is willing to duck away from the spotlight for the near future."

And after what happened to him, Wang and his allies have been plotting their revenge for some time - waiting just long enough for the scandal to fade from public view before counterattacking. And strike back they did.\n\nThe RCA held little back when they began following up on leads regarding financial propriety surrounding the Central Bank of China. Run by Song Ziwen and his clique, investigators claim to have found significant discrepancies in its accounting following a preliminary audit, and have already begun a series of arrests. As they continue to chase down the paper trail, Song has defended his compatriots' actions in a closed-door CEC hearing as being necessary to pay off various illicit debts accrued by the party during the insurgency - a revolutionary necessity. Moreover, he notes that continuing this investigation will undermine the fragile stability of the central bank.\n\nNo one has yet to accuse Song himself, a CEC member and Song Qingling's brother, of any wrong-doing. But as the hounds close in, it is increasingly obvious this witch-hunt is a reprisal for the Yiguandao crisis. Pointedly, Chu Minyi is said to have already been lined up to replace Song, a testament to the Residence Faction's growing power. Faced with the prospect of being publicly disgraced, Song has expressed the preference to quietly resign from his CEC seat (while retaining his responsibilities in the financial world) as his sister's allies scramble to respond."

Many in the Party witnessed the events of the 1900 Boxer Rebellion unfold and have grown up in a China long battered by the Western powers.\n\nThe French journalist and member of the Internationale's Military Mission in China, André Malraux, has recently returned from China on leave to report to the European socialist community on the whereabouts of the Chinese national revolution. While he writes warmly of members of the Reorganisation Comrades Association, he also writes warily off the intense politicisation of the National Revolutionary Army - a concept unfamiliar to the French system of militias and the national guard. Furthermore, he presents Deng Yanda in an unflattering and orientalist light - denouncing the latter as a Bonapartist.\n\nIn return, Deng has fired back against such accusations by arguing that the MMIC has intervened in the existing structure of the NRA by promoting individuals such as Zhou Enlai, amongst other conflicts. He rumbles that the MMIC behave recklessly, willing to expend Chinese soldiers like their own version of sepoys or askari.\n\nThe tirade has invited a difficult look into the NRA's politicisation as more nationalist members of the NRA have sided with Deng. In contrast, European-trained officers have sided with Malraux and the decisions made by the MMIC. Faced with this potential faux de pas, the leadership of the Kuomintang must act quickly in deciding whether or not to reprimand the haughty Napoleon-in-the-making or to reprimand the foreign sower of discord."

They have also been known for their pragmatism, willing to accommodate aligned groups as needed to advance their goals.\n\nStretching this however, is the entry of newer groups into the national intellectual dialogue. The China Revival Society and the Chinese Syndicalist Party's \"Radical\" faction have both ridden the coattails of the successes of more mainstream socialist groups. However, as nationalistic, iconoclastic sentiment rises they have found a greater following, emboldening them to create newspapers and publications of their own.\n\nAffiliated with the CRS is the Qian Tu (lit. \"Future\", \"Prospects\") paper. Meanwhile many CSP Radicals have begun subscribing to Qu Qiubai's Hot Blood Daily (so-named for their belief that the hot blood of the oppressed will overcome the cold iron of the strong) and Dongfang zazhi (Eastern Miscellany) which frequently runs articles dealing with the tensions between Marxism and utopian socialism.\n\nThe party wields a fairly powerful security apparatus, capable of censoring unwanted opinions as needed - especially those bucking the Kuomintang orthodoxy.

Li Jishen has privately reported to Chairman Wang that more and more officers are joining radical groups within the military. Worryingly, the main benefactor is not the \"usual suspects\" - in Deng Yanda and his Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association (WMARCA). Although Deng is too proud to admit it in public, he has privately confessed to his close allies his fears that the WMARCA is losing respect with younger officers and freshly graduated cadets.\n\nThe primary benefactor of this shift appears to be China Revival Society, a group of totalitarian nationalists led by General Hu Zongnan and other disaffected officers. Also distrusting the military Old Guard are many radicals in the CSP, who have begun to organise militias independently of the NRA - increasingly disobeying the directives of the CSP's Orthodox Faction and Internationale advisors.

The greater damage however was the media fallout as images of the attempt circulated. Although most published statements condemning the attack and wishing the Chairman a speedy recovery, plenty noted that this is only the latest report of violence against politicians.\n\nFor insiders, the culprit is an open-secret, even as the police interrogate the perpetrator. Radical officers within the NRA affiliated with the CRS have often acted with reckless abandon, a testament to the Kuomintang's inability to handle the rising radicalism within their own movement, too busy fighting amongst themselves to give stable leadership.

The small cell he was part of was well organised, and despite efforts to conceal it, part of larger cells nested within cells.\n\nThe trail went cold before any conclusive proof could be brought against anyone, though it was most definitely tied to security and intelligence circles. A disturbing \"hit-list\" was uncovered in a raid, with dozens of names of major civilian and military leaders listed as targets. The extent to which the list represents carefully chosen targets versus fantasy is moot, given its horrific nature.\n\nDue to the clandestine nature of the situation, it is unlikely that the highest ranking culprits will be caught, at least this time.

In rural villages and hamlets, once strongholds for the PAC and agrarian cooperative ideals, fear permeates the air. Many turn away from Song and the PAC, seeking protection from the utter mayhem plaguing the region.\n\nAcross the land, radicalised peasants turn to the RCA and CSP radicals, organising militias that often rove about to stamp out \"reactionaries\".

In response, worrying reports have emerged that some landlords have been allowed to return as the people tire of political radicalism.\n\nIn light of these developments the PAC has doubled down on their strongholds, stripping away various aligned NRA detachments to guard aligned villages, adding to the disarray.

 CHI.midgame.026.d: "In 1906, two years after the foundation of the Tongmenghui and long before there was a Syndicalist revolution, the (New) World Society (Shijie she) was founded by four friends Zhang Renjie, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and Cai Yuanpei in Paris. They believed that a new world was coming, one of liberation and freedom for every man - one not only political but also social. Young, intellectual, and anarchist at the time, they mentored many future socialists in the Kuomintang through their various revolutionary efforts including newspapers, the Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement, and countless writings.\n\nUnfortunately, despite being validated by the European revolutions, the syndicalist movement had left them behind in forming the Chinese Syndicalist party. Forced into a secondary role in the League of Chinese Syndicalists, much to their chagrin, their vocal defence of the political tutelage made them unpopular among libertarian socialist circles - Li Shizeng for example has been quoted as saying \"China's fourth-order revolution is a revolution for the entire populace adapted to the complex demands of the situation.\"\n\nStill, their powerful connections within the dominant Kuomintang party (they effectively control the Central Supervisory board) has given them a critical advantage in syndicalist politics and vaunted them once more into the spotlight. Although the League of Chinese Syndicalists has since collapsed under the weight of infighting, the World Society (led by their protege Yi Peiji) commands the respect of most syndicalists in China.\n\nProponents of a certain utopian interpretation of Proudhonist class reconciliation and universal harmony, they condemn what they see as needless stoking of class conflict while creating a syndicalist nation. They have begun to stand harshly against Wang Jingwei and the RCA's authoritarian leadership, throwing their lot with the opposition."

 CHI.midgame.028.d: "The first generation of the Chinese Syndicalist party's leadership has long coalesced into the so-called \"Orthodox Faction\", a group of older intellectuals educated abroad. Consisting of many former anarchists and labour organisers, similar to France a compromise was hammered out between the council-based Marxists (led by former anarchist turned councilist Chen Duxiu, who has since renounced the anarchist movement) and union-based syndicalists (led by Li Lisan). They were pragmatic - compromising with the Kuomintang to form the United Front and other non-KMT leftists to form the Chinese Syndicalist party.\n\nThese critical compromise kept the spirit of syndicalism alive and well, even with the disastrous Northern Expedition and many of their revolutionary niches absorbed by the Kuomintang. Primarily urban-based, they reason that the proletariat and peasant must work together to defeat imperialism and further believe that China must industrialise first to achieve true syndicalism. In the meanwhile, they hope to steer their sister party away from authoritarianism.\n\nThe restive nature of the syndicalist movement has unfortunately proved to be its downfall. The League of Chinese Syndicalists is effectively no more, with many having grown alienated by the power-struggles that emerged from within it. Even as the CSP-Orthodox Faction re-establishes its leadership, there is no piecing it back together. That said, Chen and Li are determined to carry on its legacy, ensuring the stable, but steady transition to China's syndicalist future."

 CHI.midgame.029.d: "The Kuomintang's centrist, civilian faction has always had a complicated relationship with the left. When the Western Hills Conference was first held in opposition to the reorganisation and the late Dr. Sun's alliance with the Internationale, Sun Fo and his clique was initially open to joining with other right-wingers but ultimately was cowed by the growing influence of Wang Jingwei. Since then, they have mostly acted on the sidelines, serving as a more pliant internal opposition for the RCA that Wang can \"compromise\" with to demonstrate his statesmanship while containing the PAC.\n\nStill, this has not stopped Sun Fo from openly criticising the government or continuing to champion his relatively liberal views influenced by his education in the United States. The PAC have made repeated overtures to the Reconstruction Faction (RF), but with the RF's growing internal clout it appears the old \"iron-neck\" has begun flying a bit too close to the sun and fancying himself as genuinely the primary alternative to Wang's leadership.\n\nIf that was the case, a harsh reality check is soon to come - outside of government halls and party elders the RF finds very little popular support and a growing chorus of opponents who condemn them for \"selling out the revolution to the bourgeoisie\".

Whether because of their own initiative, the RCA's desire for a controlled opposition, or the PAC's effort to build a broad opposition to Wang, the institutional strength of the RF has backfired.\n\nWhile not necessarily reactionary, the RF is clearly to the right and out of step with the broader Kuomintang. To an extent it appears their leadership recognises this, and the \"India Clique\" (nicknamed for their service [HND.GetNameDef]) have grown bolder in courting high ranking officers in the National Revolutionary Army.\n\nGenerals Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue have been identified as the ring-leaders of this effort and are long-time personal friends of the Sun family. The scandal further imperils the position of Minister of War Li Jishen, a fellow former Fourth Army compatriot. With the neutrality of the National Revolutionary Army now in question, Marshal Li's stature has diminished to the benefit of his enemies, allowing Young Guard officers dissatisfied with his leadership to push for changes."

 CHI.midgame.031.intro: "Although the Kuomintang, in a vanguardist fashion, maintains that the party takes precedence over the state for the duration of the political tutelage, the conquest of Nanjing means that the party is forced to contend with the realities of governance. To set the groundwork for Dr. Sun's vision, a provisional Legislative Yuan has been established. Still subordinate in status to the Kuomintang National Congress and the Central Executive Committee, the exact relationship between this government parliamentary body and party organs is still in flux.\n\nDespite their junior status, this unicameral legislature is not totally powerless, meeting regularly (unlike the party congress) and appealing to the intellectuals. Naturally of course, RCA members hold a thin majority of seats (albeit divided between radical and moderates). Other KMT seats have been given to the PAC and RF, as well as a few old-guard members. Considerably fewer have been given to the United Front, the largest being the CSP joined by a few allied independents (the Dangwai)."

 CHI.midgame.032.t: "The Passage of the [GetYear] Organic Law"
 CHI.midgame.032.d: "With a finalised constitution far in the distance (envisioned only after unification), a working group has been tasked by the National Congress to draft an organic law to supplement the largely defunct 1912 Provisional Constitution. It is modelled after Sun Yat-sen's writings, where he envisioned a government with five branches, with a weak President above them.\n\nThe first three are the more traditional Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Yuans. They are joined by the Examination Yuan, dedicated to identifying and keeping records of qualified candidates for civil service positions both nationally and provincially and in some ways a modernised Imperial Service Exam. The second is the Control Yuan, which is given the powers of audit, oversight and impeachment.\n\nGiven the circumstances, these two smaller Yuans are effectively sinecures, meant to respectfully shunt side-lined elders, incompetent recipients of patronage, and over-ambitious upstarts to a place they can do minimal damage. Accordingly there were concerns of corruption and \"bureaucratisation\", however Wang has elected to throw a bone to the Reconstruction Faction. Whether out of genuine idealism or simply to be contrarian, the RF is insistent that the new government be done \"correctly\" in their eyes and follow Sun's constitutional theory.\n\nWith the legislation now sure to be approved, the only remaining matter is how to distribute positions. With a list of applicants already in front of him, the President and his closest advisors decide their nominations..."

 CHI.midgame.033.d: "The Judicial Yuan is the branch of government that oversees the Supreme Court, the Supreme Administrative Court, the Disciplinary Court, and also the Ministry of Justice and Administration. Given the numerous constitutional ambiguities during the political tutelage period, with a decades old Provisional Constitution that has yet to be formally replaced, there is some interest by the Kuomintang's competing factions to have a sympathetic figure at its helm. Although in practice the Central Executive Committee has the final say in constitutional affairs, the final candidate will likely set the tone for the yuan as a whole in its formative years.\n\nGiven the RCA's dominance of the government thus far, it is widely expected that Wang will appoint someone from outside of his clique. The leading two candidates are Guo Guanjie and Wu Chaoshu (CC Wu). Guo Guanjie is a French-educated professor of law who taught at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou. Well qualified, he is also a high ranking member of the PAC - a faction Wang would like to keep contained. Wu Chaoshu was the first Chinese lawyer in Hong Kong, educated in the United Kingdom, and the chairman of the Judicial Committee in the 1925 Guangzhou government. His outspoken affiliation with the RF has made him an object of mistrust however among socialist circles.\n\nOf course, there is always a third option. Both men are long-time Kuomintang members, but perhaps some fresh blood is needed. The young Gu Zhengding is a scion of the RCA educated in Sun Yat-sen University in Paris. It certainly would not be a good look for the Chairman, but he's survived worse."

 CHI.midgame.034.t: "The Clash for Canton"
 CHI.midgame.034.d: "Guangzhou, and indeed Guangdong province as a whole, was in many ways the birthplace of the Kuomintang revolution. Many revolutionaries are Cantonese or have deep ties to the region, and as a result it was no surprise that its liberation caused great celebration within the party. President Wang Jingwei gave a triumphant address to great fanfare before a crowd at the old Whampoa site, echoing Dr. Sun's address at the academy's opening ceremony in 1924.\n\nBut as the jubilant mood recedes, the troubles begin. Officially, governors (a title now renamed Chairman of the Provincial Government) are supposed to be elected by local party Provincial Congresses. Practically however, with local cells still in disarray, governance has been administered on an ad hoc basis. With the sheer symbolic importance of Guangdong, the new Provincial Chairman will likely be decided by the Central Executive Committee.\n\nThe Residence Faction has put its weight behind Chen Yaozu, a Guangzhou/Guangdong civil servant in the 1920s and Chen Bijun's younger brother. They managed to strong-arm the reluctant RCA to back his candidacy, but Wang, embarrassed by their shameless nepotism, has expressed some openness in hearing other candidates. Sun Fo and the Reconstruction Faction are backing Liang Hancao, a legislator with experience as a Guangzhou party secretary. Both factions have the same idea in mind - have their associate take control of the region's fruitful patronage networks to build a fortress for their camp.\n\nSong Qingling and Deng Yanda for their part have an ace up their sleeve. General Chen Mingshu, the face of the \"Productive People's Party\" (a KMT splinter group in Guangzhou during Chen Jiongming's rule) continues to be a bastion in regional politics. Despite his checkered past siding with opponents of the party, he has attempted to return to the fold along with the PPP. The MinGan leadership testify that they played an integral part in supplying the insurgency with smuggled arms, and should be rewarded. Others protest that allowing military officer to hold the position would dilute the civilian leadership of our revolution."

Harnessing the power of the mass movement is ever vital if we are to win this time around, and figuring out how to do so remains fresh on the minds of leading voices in our government. Dong Biwu, perhaps the most famous dual KMT-CSP membership holder, regularly speaks on regulations for punishing local despots. Ling Ping, another radical, speaks of giving farmers their own guards and the power to suppress \"counter-revolutionaries\" on their own initiative. These radical CSP aligned voices are often supported by members of the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine (MMIC), notably M.N. Roy, who argue for radical agrarian uprisings to advance the revolutionary cause. In general, radicals in the CSP (and even some of the Orthodox Faction) see their duty to bring the idea of class struggle from the proletariat in the cities to the rural countryside.\n\nNot everyone agrees however. On the other end of the revolutionary spectrum, there are plenty of those who emphasise the nationalist element of the revolution at the expense of the socialist dimension. They often find their voice in the Reconstruction Faction, who argue that this is not a time to make enemies and that there are plenty of \"honourable\" league authorities who were simply misguided in their initial alignment. They wish to offer broad amnesty for \"reformed\" reactionaries and for the party to moderate its language to simply \"measured\" reforms."

The young two brothers, Gu Zhenglun and Gu Zhenggang studied abroad in their youth at Sun Yat-sen University in Paris before joining the RCA in its exile phase. They became prominent organisers within the Reorganised Comrades Association (RCA) - often doing the dirty work for Chen Gongbo and are in many ways rising stars for the Radical Faction.\n\nThe elder brother (born over a decade prior to Gu Zhenggang), went a different path. Gu Zhenglun entered military school about four years after the birth of his first younger brother, studying in Japan and participating in the Xinhai Revolution. He fought under Sun Yat-sen in the Constitutional Protection War, and a leading member of the right-wing faction of the Kuomintang. He has become locally famous for organising the Gendarmerie (Military Police) in Yunnan, with giving them the motto \"don't lie, don't cheat, keep your duty, and remember your duty\".\n\nWith the conquest of Guizhou, the younger Gus have lobbied extensively for not only amnesty but also the instatement of their brother to command. Privately, they have noted that the RCA is short on loyalist military personnel, and having a \"Praetorian Guard\" of sorts made up of Gu Zhenglun's fanatically courageous Gendarmerie might give them an edge in forestalling any coup. Naturally of course, there are many who feel allowing not only a reactionary but a party traitor into our ranks puts the entire revolution in jeopardy."

Wang and his allies have been steadily accruing power across the government, taking advantage of his position as Chairman of the ever weakening CEC and President of the Republic.\n\nThis near absolute power over his rivals, however, has also stifled internal discourse and made it difficult to present even legitimate grievances against his policies. The RCA and the Residence Faction have grown bolder to the point of arrogance, and perhaps even worse than the complacency is that they've already begun fighting over the spoils across major institutions.\n\nWang's rivals are hardly extinguished however. Dissatisfied and no longer feeling that they can achieve change through legitimate channels, many feel enticed towards other means of ousting Wang. If the Chairman wishes to step up and be the wise statesman he claims to be, this would be the time - the stability of the republic is at stake."

Even as a battle of wills is waged between supporters of the Chairman and his growing list of opponents, the brave soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army and the millions others counting continue to suffer and die across the nation. The Provisional Action Committee does not seek to destroy the Kuomintang along with its conceited RCA leadership, instead they wish to redeem it from within and restore the legitimate values of the party.\n\nNonetheless the withering attacks against Chairman Wang have been ceaseless, destabilising the government as a whole and threatening the cause. It has also bred considerable resentment among those who defend the Chairman as well as those who extol the need for a strong leader to protect the nation.

 CHI.midgame.039.d: "As the ranks of syndicalists grow, the League of Chinese Syndicalists has become more and more divided. The original League was founded by the Chinese Syndicalist party as a means of consolidating non-Kuomintang socialists together within the confines of the United Front, as part of a deliberate strategy to maintain leverage in negotiations with their senior partner. This mean that a disparate coalition of Marxists, anarchists, syndicalists, and other leftists - who otherwise would never had any chance of power in the original United Front - were brought under a shaky banner. Now the League suffers from their own success - with all their hard work and sacrifices potentially undone if the League fails to find a direction soon.\n\nLike the Kuomintang, their libertarian promises of utopia have been largely confined to rhetoric for the duration of the tutelage. The Orthodox establishment of the Chinese Syndicalist party is effectively built on being compatible with the United Front, willing to work closely albeit independently with the Kuomintang. They envision a future compromise system of both union-based and council-based democracy, a platform that has come under increasing scrutiny as the flaws of the French system become more apparent. The younger generation of the CSP, often known as the radicals, are Marxist by orientation. Less concerned than their Orthodox peers about democracy in the near-term, they see unions as a means to an end - a way of empowering the proletariat and to be eventually discarded in favour of a council-based system of representation.\n\nOutside of the CSP is the World Society, the continuation of the older Chinese anarchist movement. Utopian by nature, their members are heavily integrated into the Kuomintang and see a future where the League is folded into their senior party. To them, the tutelage is only temporary, and afterwards the Kuomintang (under World Society influence) will march on to a harmonious, free future."

Although in theory joined together in a united front against imperialism and reactionaries, in practice they often compete for influence among similar power bases in students, unions, and intellectuals. Therefore the League's power expands, so does the ranks of its detractors who fear the Kuomintang's role being usurped.\n\nAs evidence of the senior party's displeasure, official newspapers have stopped reporting League successes - downplaying its role in United Front activities and in some cases even portraying them negatively. Discussions have notably chilled between the competing leaderships, especially as younger activists begin to take initiative of their own to break out of the Kuomintang's shadow.\n\nFaced with this situation, the leaders of the League have begun to diverge in approach. Independence has its benefits in establishing the syndicalist movement as being more than just window-dressing, but it has its cost - especially as power begins to shift. On the other hand, remaining too close to the Kuomintang has drawn criticism of being overly subordinate - discarding syndicalists promises for the benefit of entrenched party interests over the needs of the people."

 CHI.midgame.200.d: "When the National Revolutionary Army collapsed during the concluding stages of the Northern Expedition, it also had to bear the loss of the academy's beloved instructor - the now controversial Chiang Kai-shek. As the NRA remnants loyal to the left-wing of the Party fled for the MinGan Zone, they nominated the capable general Li Jishen to take on the role of Whampoa's headmaster.\n\nAs the titular headmaster and War Minister of the Kuomintang, Li transformed and prepared the NRA for its liberation of China's east. However his responsibilities have since grown tremendously and he has indicated his desire to delegate responsibility for the restored academy to someone else. Meanwhile with the NRA swelling in ranks, staff officers who served with distinction during the League War have been promoted to fill newly opened positions, most notably Huang Qixiang, Zhang Fakui, and Xiao Jinguang.\n\nDespite the plethora of new openings, competition has nonetheless been fierce, especially within the growing Academy in regard to Li's successor. Members of the NRA's Old Guard, including long-time guerrilla officers, have coalesced around the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association (WMARCA). Their leader is Deng Yanda, Whampoa's former head of the Political Department and co-leader of the PAC.\n\nThey are opposed by the \"Young Guard\" of the army, consisting primarily of those trained abroad in the Whampoa in exile. These European-trained officers favour a modern approach to the NRA, seeking to transform it into a truly party-subordinate armed force while relying on Western-style tactics and technologies. Led by the deputy (and often acting) Headmaster of Whampoa during the exile period, Zhang Zhizhong (an RCA sympathiser), their supporters have traded accusations with the Old Guard for their \"outdated\" views and tolerance of suspected reactionaries. In turn, WMARCA officers often suspect the young guard of harbouring ultra-radicals within their ranks, with potentially nefarious ideas for the future."

The NRA's official military doctrine, therefore, is to focus on rapid engagements designed to strike and surprise the enemy - focusing on grand encirclements against what could potentially be a much larger enemy foe. For many of the officers that had served in the guerrilla zone, such as Zhang Yunyi, Wang Yaowu, and Xu Xiangqian, promotions have been handed out due to their service.\n\nSince the return of the Kuomintang to the world of Chinese politics, Deng Yanda's WMARCA has grown substantially in size - owing itself primarily to alumni members of the Whampoa Academy and also to those who are personally loyal to Deng. Organised into smaller cells, the goal of the WMARCA is to inspire and recruit new and past members of Whampoa; so that they may foster loyalty to the Provisional Action Committee.\n\nWhen the NRA split, a faction loyal to the leftist Central Committee was sent to wait and observe the nationalist revolution held in [HND.GetNameDef]. The so-called India Clique is known throughout the Central Committee as being sympathetic to the Nationalist Revolution while not necessarily holding much commitment to the ideals of socialism. While Deng was overseas, he was able to establish connections with sympathetic Indian ears, and curiously enough, the NRA officers stationed in India offered their membership in the WMARCA. Citing Deng's connections to the former 4th Army of the NRA and their respect for the General, working with these officers may help give the PAC further support within the NRA."

 CHI.midgame.202.d: "Eloquent, charismatic, handsome, visionary - these are words that the pamphlets of the PAC and the WMARCA frequently use to describe the headmaster of Whampoa, Deng Yanda. To some observers, owing to his military genius and his studies in Europe- he has earned the nickname of \"the Tukhachevsky of the East\" or even \"Red Napoleon\" due to the considerable influence he had gained within the Kuomintang and the National Revolutionary Army. The General holds connections ranging from Guangdong militarists such as Chen Jiongming, Chen Mingshu, and Deng Keng to those within both the LCS and the conservative wings of the Kuomintang. Not only is he a soldier, but years of study and party politics have gifted Deng with a great sense of politics, and he is known to be well-versed in Marxism. A highly proud man, Deng views himself as a tool in the greater spinning wheel of destiny - with the PAC's revolution an inevitable part of world history.\n\nWhile few can deny that within China, there are few as exceptional as General Deng Yanda - there are also those who view his arrogance with heavy distaste. In speeches given to the WMARCA, he has likened the PAC to the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ - with himself being the Christ, willing to be sacrificed on the cross for national salvation. His frequent engagement in criticism of Wang Jingwei has earned the scathing hatred of RCA members such as Chen Gongbo and the Residence Faction. There are rumours among more radical NRA members that Deng is merely a romantic fool that may drive China into chaos.\n\nNonetheless, Deng is held in high regard by the WMARCA and many of the so-called \"Old Guard\" of the NRA. While having our own Red Napoleon certainly boosts morale, perhaps we should consider toning down the rhetoric of such praise - lest we further divide the Party's unity."

Several leading officers from Europe have been promoted as well including Nie Rongzhen and Du Yuming (the latter of whom is actually a member of Deng Yanda's WMARCA but nonetheless has pledged to work with the new headmaster due to his own interest in armoured technology). Recent appointments have also curiously seen a number of \"China Revival Society\"(CRS) members promoted including He Zhonghan and Deng Wenyi. While appearing as army reformers and modernists, there are rumours that they hold much more radical plans on the direction of the NRA.\n\nIn addition, there has also been a curious interest to the growing relevance of the China Revival Society and the \"European returnees.\" For some in the MinGan Zone, the leadership for the past decade was decentralised to say the least, and some MinGan members preferred the nostalgia of a different era, when the Academy was led by an endearing headmaster whose absolute word was authority. As a result some of those who were in the NRA during the insurgency have nonetheless began to pivot ideologically towards the growing influence of the so-called \"Young Guard.\"\n\nCertainly the Young Guard brings a new energy to Whampoa, with the new headmaster proclaiming that this will be the start of a new modern Chinese revolutionary army. Nonetheless there has been notice that there are more radical ideas being published or spread routinely - ideas linking the revolution to Maximalism, Savinkov, and Sorel. Only time will tell whether or not this threat of radicalism is real."
 CHI.midgame.203.a: "We need fresh ideas to win."
 CHI.midgame.203.b: "Their ideas are awfully drastic."
 CHI.midgame.204.t: "The United Front and Whampoa"
 CHI.midgame.204.d: "Despite the Kuomintang's United Front policy with the League of Chinese Syndicalists  (LCS), the party's \"dangguo\" policy had in theory only allocated those with Kuomintang membership to participate in the training halls of Whampoa. Nonetheless, in the spirit of the Academy's first united front policies, those who are members of the Chinese Syndicalist Party are allowed to enrol in Whampoa despite holding membership for both the CSP and the KMT.\n\nThe Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine (MMIC) has nonetheless proposed that the Kuomintang relax its strict policy on cultivating party members to Whampoa. They argue that if the Kuomintang is to indeed become the vanguard for a free China - that it must be open to the idea of accepting other patriotic Chinese revolutionaries to the academy's ranks. Furthermore, they would like to be able to sponsor individuals from the LCS to participate in Whampoa under their proposed reformed policy.\n\nWhile the move has been met with warm reception by Guo Moruo (an LCS member in the Kuomintang's political department) along with more radical members of the LCS, who do not have joint membership but rather are mostly loyal to the Chinese Syndicalist Party - the proposal has also been met with frustration especially amongst more conservative members of the Party. To them, the introduction of recruits from non-KMT aligned socialist leagues or unions will merely dilute the ideals of both the Party and the Army. As such a compromise has been proposed - to only allow a certain number of syndicalists from the CSP to participate in the new ranks."
 CHI.midgame.204.a: "Allow anyone from the National Revolution to join."
 CHI.midgame.204.b: "Allow only token CSP representation."
 CHI.midgame.204.c: "Maintain a strict one party stance."
 CHI.midgame.205.t: "The Propaganda Department"
 CHI.midgame.205.d: "In May of 1924, the first cadets at Whampoa received political training from Whampoa's newly established Political Department - inspired by revolutionary trends worldwide. At that time, Liao Zhongkai was appointed the official head of the department. At the same time, prominent party members such as Dai Jitao, Wang Jingwei, and Hu Hanmin were lecturers in political subjects. This first class was routinely given political talks as they were organised into the Model Regiment - the precursor to the NRA's First Army.\n\nWith the re-establishment of Whampoa, the Political Department has been re-established with General Zhou Enlai once more resuming his position as head of the political department. With the encouragement of some in the RCA and LCS, Zhou has the position to encourage Whampoa students to read about socialism, the history of the French and British revolutions, and Marxism. Nonetheless, other ideas are flourishing in lectures as well - General Deng Yanda is known to frequently encourage his soldiers to seek the peasants out in the countryside and to live amongst them. Other classes play up the notion of carrying the late Dr. Sun's will with the promise that perhaps the Kuomintang may be successful this time. There have also been lectures by more nationalistic and radical officers, who instead focus on revitalising the revolution against China's true domestic and foreign enemies."
 CHI.midgame.205.a: "Extol the defence of the peasants."
 CHI.midgame.205.b: "Emphasise the socialist revolution."
 CHI.midgame.205.c: "Stress the nationalist cause."
 CHI.midgame.205.e: "Play up Sun Yat-sen's legacy."
 CHI.midgame.205.f: "Note we are not alone in this fight."
 CHI.midgame.206.t: "The Fujian Naval Community"
 CHI.midgame.206.d: "Fujian is home to a thriving naval community, owing to its strategic location and lucrative coastal trade over the years. Fuzhou for example is home to major naval institutions such as Fuzhou Shipping Bureau, Fuzhou Shipping Academy, and Mawei Naval Academy. Even with the Legation Cities establishing further control over the area, Fujianese often dominate the military and civilian fleet. Further north, the Jiangnan region also competes as a naval and commercial shipping centre. Jiangnan Shipyard and Wusong Naval Academy in Shanghai and Jiangnan Naval Academy near Nanjing have provided ships and sailors for the modernising nation.\n\nWith the triumph of our previously Fujian-based revolutionaries and the provisional capital being established in Nanjing, it is only natural that both regions dominate our small fleet. That said however, like most things in the new government, things have quickly divided into factions. Li Zhilong, a graduate of Wusong and having studied abroad in the exile period, has rallied a clique of Internationale trained officers and those educated at Whampoa naval academy to demand a strictly socialist, revolutionary navy. They argue that with the limited number of officer spots available, they may as well be filled with dedicated revolutionaries and in any case foreign trained officers are of superior quality.\n\nChen Shaokuan and Chen Jiliang, both Fujianese and graduates of Jiangnan Naval Academy, have pushed for the broader admission of former League personnel like themselves. They dream of a much larger fleet and call for a lenient political rehabilitation programme, merely requiring vetting from known Kuomintang loyalists. Given the fluid nature of loyalties during the insurgent period and tight family ties of the region, this would give a substantial advantage to old MinGan leadership."
 CHI.midgame.206.a: "Keep the revolution pure - favour the Whampoa naval clique."
 CHI.midgame.206.b: "A grand navy is our shield - favour the Fujianese naval clique."
 CHI.midgame.207.t: "The Central Naval Academy"
 CHI.midgame.207.d: "The sea and rivers is the lifeblood for much of the Five Provinces, and for our revolution we depend on access to Internationale aid shipments and regular donations from OCC comprador bourgeoisie magnates. For much of the late Qing era, the navy was heavily decentralised and placed under regional leadership, with little coordination. This problem was worsened by the diverting of funding away from the fleet during the warlord era, a neglect that further hollowed out our naval capabilities.\n\nYet, slowly but surely this appears to be ready for change. Senior naval officers have proposed setting the groundwork for rebuilding the Chinese fleet to match imperialist powers, a process that may take years but the basic preparations can begin almost immediately. They have taken over the old Jiangnan Naval Academy site, turning it into the headquarters for the Republic of China navy.\n\nTheir zeal and grandiose visions, however, have soon met a match with the senior National Revolutionary Army leadership, who have demanded a total modernisation of the fleet under a central command structure. Rather than the Navy being given an equal seat at the table however, it is clear their vision involves the subordination of this new fleet to the army - a fact reinforced by the NRA's plan to create their own naval school under army jurisdiction. Naval officers have protested that the generals simply do not understand naval affairs and the navy should be a separate branch, widening the headache the Military Affairs Commission is now forced to address."
 CHI.midgame.207.a: "A revolution is won by land, everything else is secondary."
 CHI.midgame.207.b: "The admirals know best about defending the coast from invaders."
 CHI.midgame.208.t: "Internal Security of the Party"
 CHI.midgame.208.d: "While the revolution may have initially been successful with the recent victories of the NRA during the League War, to many within the Party - there are still plenty of imperialists, warlords, dissenters, counter-revolutionaries, and reactionaries that lurk even amongst the Party itself. As such the Central Committee has come together in a brief emergency meeting to determine the future of the Party's internal security apparatus.\n\nEncouraged by the Reorganised Comrades Association, the Political Department under the distinguished General Zhou Enlai has proposed the creation of the \"Special Service Section of the Central Committee\" (Zhongyang Teke). Along with his chief lieutenants Gu Shunzhang, Xiang Zhongfa, and Xiong Xianghui - the Teke professes to enforcing the party's socialist based orthodoxy while promising efficiency to root out local resistance. Nicknamed the \"Red Squad\", the organisation's members are mostly localised in the Legation Cities with connections ranging from syndicalist unions to gangsters.\n\nMeanwhile, members of the National Revolutionary Army have been eager to push utilising Dai Chunfeng's established networks across the Shanghai Underground to create the National Bureau of Investigation and Statistics \"Juntong.\" An outgrowth of underground clandestine activities with extensive connections to criminal activity and \"nationalistic\" gangs, the Juntong is known to have some fraternal and semi-esoteric behaviour - with their own shadowy \"League of Ten\", whom profess nothing but absolute loyalty to their Laoban, Dai Chunfeng.\n\nAs a compromise, party members have instead suggested merging both planned organisations to create a unified Ministry of State Security. Increasingly worried by the growing factionalism within the Kuomintang, this plan will place the leadership of state security under Dai Chunfeng, while granting considerable power to Zhou and the Political Department in handling internal affairs."

 CHI.midgame.208.b: "Fund Dai Chunfeng's BIS"
 CHI.midgame.208.c: "Combine both into the MSS"
 CHI.midgame.209.t: "Teke Heroism on Display!"
 CHI.midgame.209.d: "Nicknamed the \"Zhongyang Teke\", the Special Operations Section of the Central Committee is the brainchild of the head of the political department - General Zhou Enlai. The organisation is made up of mostly younger volunteers, those with connections to syndicalist-aligned unions, and some Shanghai gangsters. It is split into four departments: The first section (General Service Section) is in charge of protecting members of the Central Committee, the second section (Intelligence Section) is in charge of gathering intelligence on foreign and domestic enemies, the third section (Operations Section also known as the Red Squad) are in charge of assassinations, and the fourth section is the Communications Section in charge of maintaining secret codes and communications.\n\nOne of their most recent exploits involve the freeing of a prominent Chinese syndicalist Ren Bishi. Ren had been betrayed by Bai Xin, a former Whampoa alumni who has grown disillusioned with the cause. At an underground syndicalist rally in Shanghai, Legation Cities stormed the meeting hall with the help of Bai Xin's information and arrested Ren on the spot. As Ren was being escorted in a police truck to the mansion of Fan Zhengbo (detective captain of the Shanghai Police Command), members of the Operations Section ambushed the truck with pistols and submachine guns. In the chaos of the fighting, Bai Xin attempted to flee the scene but was caught and subsequently eliminated in the operation.\n\nThe operation has been lauded as a complete success with minimal losses by the Party and also by the League of Chinese Syndicalists for supporting their fellow socialists. Since the operation happened on the soil of the Legation Cities, it is also seen as a victory against foreign imperialism. Members of the Central Committee have suggested using Teke's power further by arguing that they may be used to either strengthen the Party internally, crackdown on internal dissent, or raise support amongst like-minded socialist groups and organisations."
 CHI.midgame.209.a: "Strengthen the Party."

 CHI.midgame.210.t: "The Juntong on the March!"
 CHI.midgame.210.d: "With funding for their plans secured, the League of Ten have sprung into action in building their new \"Juntong\" (National Bureau of Investigation and Statistics). Originating from a mixture of Dai Chunfeng's shady connections with the Shanghai nationalist underground and the existing military intelligence apparatus, this new agency is gearing up for offensive action - infiltrating and destabilising rival factions in China. Dai has posed three priorities for his agents to guide them for the years to come.\n\n1.) Ensure the Leader's Safety. Although they are now officially independent of Hu Zongnan's personal staff, it is clear that Dai remains a major asset for the general and his clique of extremist officers.It is no secret that they view Wang as an unworthy leader, and want him replaced.\n\n2.) Punish Corruption. The League was known to have a spartan, fraternal work environment, mixing Confucianism and revolutionary nationalism to become what they say as modern knight-errants (ironically, Dai is self conscious about his lack of direct military experience compared to his Whampoa classmates). The Juntong are adamant about eliminating internal corruption, and xenophobically view both the RF and CSP as foreign lackeys.\n\n3.) Destroy all counter-revolutionary forces. The Juntong are utterly devoted to the nationalistic cause and have thrown themselves into the task at hand. Cells are being established across the nation, and agents embedding themselves across society. Clergymen, politicians, the press have been swayed, bribed, or coerced into service and Dai has already begun making ties with movie stars, playboys, and opera performers. Even plenty of Chinese overseas have been recruited to this growing intelligence agency."

 CHI.midgame.211.t.juntong: "Juntong Sleepers Form"
 CHI.midgame.211.t.teke: "Teke Sleepers Form"
 CHI.midgame.211.intro: "Agents of [CHI.GetNameDef] are on the move! Ever since their victory over the League, the Kuomintang and their allies have swelled in numbers, with pockets of sympathisers scattered all over the nation. Some are true believers - educated in socialism's promises and disgruntled with the status quo. Some are veterans of China's various republican armies, who have thrown their lot with a new hope. Many are graduates of Whampoa, whose nationalistic or revolutionary spirit has been reawakened by the party's return. Still, plenty are simply men or women with their own private grudges, or perhaps bought off by the prospect of social mobility."
 CHI.midgame.211.d.CHI.juntong: "$CHI.midgame.211.intro$\n\nDai Chunfeng has organised his detachments carefully, selecting leaders often from men he knew from his Whampoa days. Zheng Jiemin has been sent southwards to set up camp in Guangdong, while the Hunan branch has been assigned to Tang Zong. Further west cells have been established in the mountains under Qiu Kaiji in Kunming and Zeng Guangqing in Chengdu. Northwards defunct cells under Qiao Jiacai and Ma Hansan have been reactivated, and contact made with Manchuria-based freedom fighters led by Guan Xiangying. In the various Legation cities, different station chiefs have been appointed, most notably Shanghai station chief Shen Zui. Closest to the centre of power is Dai's childhood friend Mao Renfeng, assigned to the east. Helping coordinate them is Wei Daming, a prominent communications officer.\n\nThese men, and the hundreds beneath them have gone into the belly of the beast, putting their lives in jeopardy for the cause. We can only hope that their sacrifices will be worth it one day."
 CHI.midgame.211.d.juntong: "$CHI.midgame.211.intro$\n\nWhatever the case, the source is fairly obvious. [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has authorised the creation of the humbly named National Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (also known as the Juntong) to coordinate existing clandestine networks. Led by the secretive Dai Chunfeng, detachments organised by Dai's must trusted men have been deployed nation-wide to establish sleeper cells in the various provinces. He has taken advantage of his various criminal contacts along the coast, an outgrowth of his old \"League of Ten\", but he is no ordinary gangster - his men are noted for their fanatic nationalism and commitment to the cause. Their practical ability to undermine our government is doubtful, and much of their activities have been dismissed as bluster, but we would be wise to keep an vigilant watch all the same."
 CHI.midgame.211.d.CHI.teke: "$CHI.midgame.211.intro$\n\nZhou Enlai has worked diligently in building his agency, a collection of men and women from varying walks of life. Many senior officers are from the \"Red Squad\" and long-time party operatives, though Zhou has been careful to select plenty of agents who did not have a long history as socialists - letting them blend in both inside the party and outside. Four operational sections have been created: the General Affairs Section, the Information Section, the Radio Communication Section, and the Action Section. Given Zhou's responsibilities elsewhere, his chief lieutenants Chen Geng, Gu Shunzhang, and Xiang Zhongfa often handle the day to day running of the Teke."
 CHI.midgame.211.d.teke: "$CHI.midgame.211.intro$\n\nWhatever the case, the source is fairly obvious. [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has authorised the creation of the Special Operations Section of the Central Committee (also known as the Teke) to coordinate existing clandestine networks across the nation. Led by prominent revolutionary, propagandist, and and intelligence coordinator Zhou Enlai and built around a core of intelligence operatives known as the \"Red Squad\", these agents have been sent to even the farthest corners of the nation. Ruthless as they are zealous, nonetheless they are unlikely to be able to directly undermine our government. However, it is clear the Kuomintang's national ambitions are growing."

 CHI.midgame.212.t: "Dysfunction in the MSS"
 CHI.midgame.212.d: "Like oil and water, the Red Squad and the League of Ten have not mixed well at all. Ostensibly under the purview of the Ministry of State Security, the competing groups have found themselves nearly constantly at odds despite initial efforts to integrate the revolutionary agencies. Frustrated, an effort was made to try and separate the two into different departments - with the Red Squad being assigned to interior tasks and the League assigned to external assignments.\n\nThis has not panned out all that well either. Like squabbling children, there have been fights over control of many lucrative functions such as the collection of taxes and tariffs, maintaining of smuggling networks, secret policing, and foreign intelligence gathering. A superficial level audit has revealed multiple parallel organisations, and considerable resources have been spent spying on one another rather than doing their jobs. The last straw for many in the CEC however was the decision for Dai Chunfeng and Zhou Enlai's partisans to go to the press to air their grievances, accusing the other of stealing credit and undermining the MSS.\n\nHaving made an utter fool of themselves in public and with patience running out, Deng Yanda has finally made his move. He has proposed sacking Dai as acting head of the ministry and curtailing Zhou's influence, instead creating a new position of Minister of the Interior. He has pushed forward Zhang Yunchuan, a WMARCA military officer, who has promised to build the MSS from scratch - effectively sidelining both the Red Squad and League of Ten.\n\nSome wonder if this was what the PAC wanted all along - a chance to put a man on the cabinet. Faced with the threat, both MSS factions have sworn up and down that they will back off from infighting, and that any issues were mere growing pains. This is not a particularly credible assertion, but on the other hand, whatever we choose things can really only go up from here anyway."

 CHI.midgame.213.d.deng: "If National Revolutionary Army had a face ever since General Chiang's untimely death, it would be Deng Yanda. His storied career has taken him to the halls of Whampoa, to the cities of Europe, the hills of Jiangxi, and now to battlefields across China. With every success, his prominence rises - creating a powerful nucleus for those seeking an alternative to Wang's rule. But as his prestige soars, sometimes even his closest allies fear he is flying too close to the sun, and derogatory comments of a \"Red Napoleon\" have quickly swirled. For now though, public opinion remains on his side and so does the army as he basks in military glory."
 CHI.midgame.213.d.zhou: "If there is anyone who can save the National Revolutionary Army from corruption, it is Zhou Enlai. Diplomatic and humble, but well vested in socialist ideology, he is a long-time favourite of the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine as a paragon for a red officer. Although plenty questioned how effectively a political officer, Whampoa instructor, and minor guerilla commander would fare in the field, the trust has paid off with his determined leadership in combat. With his prestige at an all-time high, he is expected to exert it to bring the National Revolutionary Army closer to his camp, helping fend off the disloyal military cabals that threaten national stability."
 CHI.midgame.213.d.hu: "Built to create a force totally loyal to the Kuomintang, Whampoa's graduates have fought courageously for the party. But sometimes the National Revolutionary Army can take a life of its own, demanding revolution even within the party. Hu Zongnan is a veteran some of the earliest KMT expeditions, but was deprived of his chance at glory in 1927. He nonetheless made up for lost time with his recent accomplishments in the battlefield. His successes are hard to dispute, but one questions if those victories are truly to the benefit of the party. The zeal and brutality of Hu's men have caused significant concern within the CEC, even as they have little choice but to laud him in public."
 CHI.midgame.213.d.zhang: "Zhang Fakui was Dr. Sun's personal bodyguard and fought for the Kuomintang all across the Warlord Era. He rose to become commander of the legendary Fourth (\"Iron\") Army during the Northern Expedition, but during the exile period he was sidelined and sent to India to help advise [HND.GetAdjective] forces. Since the return however, he has eagerly retaken the initiative on the battlefield and claimed multiple success. With each triumph, he elevates the influence of his \"India Clique\" of centre-right officers closely affiliated with the Reconstruction Faction. How much this may calm troubled waters within the military as opposed to aggravating existing rivalries remains to be seen."
 CHI.midgame.213.d.xiao: "In many ways, Xiao Jinguang is an unlikely military hero for the Chinese revolution. Born to a disadvantaged family in Hunan, his father and grandfather died suddenly. Yet he rose to prominence nonetheless, joining the newly founded Chinese Syndicalist party and going abroad to study military theory in France. An outsider within the military, neither educated nor teaching at Whampoa, his road to command was very narrow. But having been given the chance, he has scored multiple triumphs in the battlefield. The LCS's leadership has lauded him as an example for a younger generation of syndicalist officers struggling to break into higher ranks dominated by KMT members and Old Whampoa graduates."

 CHI.midgame.218.d: "The Military Affairs Commission (MAC) was originally founded in Guangzhou as a means of overseeing, supervising and managing the National Revolutionary Army in its infancy. Originally with 64 members, Dr. Sun reduced it to 26, and by the time he died it was reduced to a board consisting of Wang Jingwei, Xu Chongzhi, Liao Zhongkai, Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, Chiang Kai-shek, Mikhail Borodin, and Wu Chaoshu. In the ensuing year or so, Cheng Qian, Li Jishen and Chen Gongbo would join the staff along with allied warlords Li Zongren, Huang Shaohong, Feng Yuxiang, Li Fulin, and Gu Yingfen.\n\nThe infighting among the MAC did it little favours during the Northern Expedition, as Chiang attempted to strong-arm Wang into yielding the Chairmanship to him, charging Wang with incompetence in military affairs. Most of its old membership have since gone one too - Tan and the warlords left, Hu and Xu were executed, Borodin recalled and replaced by Malraux, Chiang was killed in the expedition.\n\nHaving recently been restored to coordinate the new National Revolutionary Army's activities, many fear a repeat of previous battles over control of the MAC. The military brass blame interference from civilians and outsiders for its old failures, demanding only the President and senior commanders be appointed. This has been contested by those believe the NRA must be held accountable, denouncing the independent streak Chiang encouraged, and insist on further civilian oversight by the Central Executive Committee. The United Front with the backing of the MMIC has also insisted on a fair say, complicating matters even more - insisting on LCS and advisor presence on the commission. The situation on the ground demands however a decision be made quickly about the size and makeup of this body."

As a Korean nationalist party, the KNRP is generally a socialist party that also professes to adapt and follow the Three Principles of the People. As the Korean people, like the Chinese people, are oppressed and live under the chains of Japanese imperialism, the bonds between these two nations are strong. As the conflict between the Empire of Japan and a nationalist-led China seems inevitable, many Korean expatriates believe that by working with the Chinese, they may one day achieve independence with Chinese help.\n\nThat being said, per formal orders to the NRA - Kim Wonbong's rank and status have been reinstated as an official soldier within the NRA. He commands the Korean Liberation Army, a battalion of equally patriotic Korean volunteers, including a young Chang Cheol-bu, with the grand goal that one day they may return home to Korea as liberators."

 CHI.midgame.221.d.india: "Across the continent, anti-colonial sentiment has swept the Chinese nation. Of such groups is the Chinese Kuomintang, a nationalist, vanguardist party built around Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles. Dominated by leftists, they have driven out various warlords that have occupied the east coast and recently have begun outreach towards like-minded governments.\n\nAs one of the largest revolutionary governments working to free their nation from colonial shackles, the Kuomintang claim us to be kindred spirits. In some ways, this outreach began as early as 1907 when exiled Chinese revolutionaries worked with Indians and Japanese revolutionaries to form the \"Asiatic Humanitarian Brotherhood\".\n\nTimes however have changed considerably. The Northern Expedition's failure in 1927 torpedoed their initial chances at uniting their nation, and they have continued to drift leftwards. A small detachment of Chinese advisors were sent to aid us in 1934, though have since returned home, but the Chinese have been quick to point this out as proof that a fruitful partnership is possible.\n\nEven as they have returned, there is no guarantee of their success. And even if they were successful, Japan's power continues to rise, and they are likely to clash with the Chinese one way or another. Moreover, there remains disputes about the Sino-Indian borders and the status of Tibet as the Kuomintang embrace revanchism.\n\nAs the Chinese offer to mutually recognise one another, the dream of Pan-Asian cooperation seems dim. But might we still dream?"
 CHI.midgame.221.d.china: "Across the continent, a liberation fever swept across India and the people have risen up against their British oppressors! The result was the foundation of [HND.GetNameDef] by the Indian National Congress and their various allies, a government that stands as a continued testament to freedom's enduring call.\n\nOften working parallel to our own efforts across the 1920s, the [HND.GetAdjectiveCap]s are often seen as kindred spirits to our own. In some ways, this exchange of ideas began as early as 1907 when exiled Chinese revolutionaries worked with Indians and Japanese revolutionaries to form the \"Asiatic Humanitarian Brotherhood\".\n\nAs we work to free our homeland, it is imperative that we remember all the others in Asia that need liberation. A direct example of such pan-Asian partnership, independent of Japan's misguided sphere, was the Chinese military mission sent to India in 1934 under Zhang Fakui. There remain of course plenty of hurdles in future ties, such as the question of borders and dealing with the Japanese threat. But for now we salute out revolutionary comrades as we march towards freedom (and let us hope they do the same)!"

 CHI.midgame.222.d: "The brave rebels of the nations of Indochina are fighting courageously against the vile [GEA.GetAdjectiveCap] imperialists, and with our position in Eastern China secure it is high time that we support our revolutionary comrades. After all, the German intervention in 1927 showed more than anything that our struggles are connected.\n\nThe Viet Minh are a coalition of disparate socialist groups united under one banner, and there have been different points of contact throughout the years. Several attended Whampoa for example, and a few dozen even fought with us in the MinGan insurgency. Others were trained by our officers in India during the exile period. On a civilian level, their chapters are scattered throughout Southeast Asia, similar to our own diaspora networks and there is frequent contact between them.\n\nThe practical element of supporting them is more of a challenge. The [INC.GetAdjective] revolutionaries do have sympathetic contacts among civilian shipping, which has allowed them to partially evade the [GEA.GetAdjective] naval blockade, usually by first sending equipment to Bangkok and then smuggling it overland to rebel held territories. If we pooled our resources with our own OCC contacts in Southeast Asia, we might be able to get a few shipments through, though it will be dangerous and not all will make it.\n\nOwning ports closer to the region would be a great advantage, most notably Guangzhou. Given the extensive trade that flows to and from there, it would be much easier and cheaper to smuggle in equipment and we could send far more of it.

 CHI.midgame.400.t: "The Foundation of Land Reform"
 CHI.midgame.400.d: "A paramount raison d'etre for the revolution is the liberation of the peasant from exploitative tenantry and landlords. Land reform is a rallying cry for the party, and the much publicised successes in MinGan proves to be a major draw. The realities of governing however have not been as idyllic. Replicating the apparent accomplishments in MinGan has been difficult and divisive despite a shared goal of peasant run cooperatives.\n\nChen Gongbo, the leading RCA ideologue, has argued that China is a semi-feudal state that requires political organisation before a social revolution could occur. While class conflict is inevitable, he believes the mass movement requires a different handling than in Europe. Chen Duxiu and the CSP-Orthodox have switched to adopt this stance, however many CSP-Radicals continue to argue that China's problem is not feudal institutions but the domination of urban capitalists, and must adopt a proletarian socialist revolution.\n\nGu Mengyu and many RCA-Moderates contend that class struggle is not inevitable, and that China is an incipient capitalistic nation dominated by feudal lords. They, World Society, and others call for a non-violent land reform focused on rent caps and moderate redistributions. Not included in the discussion are the commoners themselves, who often know little of Marxism, syndicalism or nationalism and cling onto traditions and superstitions - a dissonance not uncommon in vanguardist politics.\n\nAs pilot programmes for land reform begin in Jiangsu, these clashing philosophies take centre stage. Until now, redistribution has been implemented on an ad-hoc basis by various commanders and commissars, creating a patchwork and inefficient system. The PAC have pushed for allowing peasants to organise from the get-go, with the party coordinating them later. The RCA have encouraged having magistrates to organise land first before giving it to the peasants, and condemn what they see as subversive PAC activity. Some extremists have privately urged the need for total nationalisation until the end of tutelage, saying it is a wartime measure."
 CHI.midgame.400.a: "Leave the patchwork system as is for now."
 CHI.midgame.400.b: "Deploy magistrates to streamline matters."
 CHI.midgame.401.t: "Rocking the Boat"
 CHI.midgame.401.d: "Across the board, the Chinese left can agree on one thing: that the sheer destitution and crushing poverty of the peasants have left them in a state of de facto feudalism, worsened by the utter instability of the warlord era. Freeing them from the (often absentee) landlords, foreign interests, tyrannical warlords and their local thugs is a major revolutionary goal, and the Kuomintang can chalk plenty of their successes to their ability to rally rural enthusiasm and nearly spontaneous uprisings of peasant militias as they march.\n\nSo why not be truly revolutionary? Not simply defeating old tyrants and replacing them, but building an entirely new system. Sadly however, progress requires breaking a few omelets, and it's not always as easy as chasing out old reactionaries.\n\nWhen magistrates (often affiliated with the RCA) were deployed in areas just outside of Nanjing to to help reorganise freshly created cooperatives and sort out disputes, many reported being intimidated or even fired upon by local militias. Worryingly, many were previously armed by the NRA and report fears that central government magistrates have come to take their land.\n\nIt wasn't long before accusations of treason began to fly. Angry hearings have charged PAC affiliated officers of deliberately stoking peasant fears to sabotage the RCA's efforts at land reform, exploiting their dominance of recently installed local rural leadership councils to undermine the party. The PAC have countered with sordid peasant testimonies of brutality and corruption by party commissars, though it appears too late: once the wheels of party machinery have started there is little stopping it.\n\nMany militias have been ordered to disarm or at least stand down, and Deng Yanda's reputation cut down to size. As the scandal slowly subsides thanks to government censorship and a PAC tactical retreat, the only thing left to deal with is approach. As a second wave of commissars are deployed they have been instructed to..."

 CHI.midgame.402.t: "The National Labour Union"
 CHI.midgame.402.d: "China's industrialisation has been uneven and heavily concentrated along the coastal cities, but it has been a long-running process facilitated in part due to external investment. The wealth generated however, has been extremely unequal - with much of it flowing out of the country and the rest lining the pockets of comprador bourgeoisie, corrupt magistrates, and warlord armies. Little trickled down to the urban poor, and plenty flocked to the socialist cause when they liberated the land.\n\nThe Kuomintang has sponsored many unions under the banner of their party-controlled \"National Labour Union\" federation in hopes of inspiring the urban proletariat to their cause and under an \"amenable\" leadership. This pliant relationship has been challenged however by the zeal in which many workers and organisers have conducted themselves with. Like a tempest in a bottle, the Kuomintang conquest has been met with the release of considerable pent up frustration from the working class.\n\nSyndicalist groups have jumped on a chance to advance their founding cause, with some reluctance at first but soon with considerable vigour. The worker is a key pillar in the Kuomintang power base, and its Central Executive Committee must certainly act quickly to mold the movement before the moment passes. Either they bind the workers closer to the party or work to redefine their relationship with their sister party."

 CHI.midgame.403.t: "The Syndicalists Flex Their Muscles"
 CHI.midgame.403.d: "Escalating Kuomintang rhetoric to fire up the proletariat has not gone unnoticed. Talk of class war and liberation has brought out a revolutionary energy from the workers that exceeds the eager expectations of even the Marxist-inspired leaders of the party. Although many members of the young guard are delighted by this display, seeing it as proof of the Kuomintang's success in bringing a voice to the oppressed, not everyone is as convinced.\n\nParticularly odious to a growing chorus of voices within the party is the independent actions of the CSP-Radicals, who have taken upon themselves to organise the workers with a conviction that sometimes outstrips even Chen Gongbo's faction. There have been growing discussions about striking against even government-operated industry (which the Kuomintang and even some CSP-Orthodox leaders maintain works for the betterment of all of China). Worse, the CSP-Radicals have begun organising militias of their own.\n\nIn their defence, Chen Shaoyu and other leaders insist that corrupt magistrates are the cause of these tensions, and that if the Kuomintang wish to truly win the people's hearts they need to do better. Many agrarian, liberal, and nationalist elements have demanded that they be reigned in for the sake of preserving unity, looking to Deng Yanda to step in their defence. Should he and the PAC fail, there is concern that amidst the rising tensions, they will turn to others for a solution - further dividing the party and pushing it to extremes.\n\nAs Deng presents his solution to the Chairman before the Central Executive Committee, he weighs his next words carefully."

 CHI.midgame.404.t: "The Draft Law on Disposition of Rebel Property"
 CHI.midgame.404.d: "To the victors go the spoils, and with the Kuomintang's victory in the Five Provinces they have seized a copious amount of treasure from defeated warlords and fleeing bourgeoisie, even if sizeable quantities have been stolen, evacuated or stashed abroad in advance. In addition to liquid assets such as gold, jewels, and cash, the Kuomintang has nationalised capital infrastructure such as railways, factories, and ports - especially targeting the hated foreign-owned investments of the AOG.\n\nBut, as always in the aftermath of victory, now comes the question of dividing shares. The National Revolutionary Army's commanders and various party commissars have been remarkably disciplined in protecting and cataloguing seized assets to the best of their ability, even as the count goes on and cases of fraud have emerged. But higher up in the chain there has been considerable discussion about how to best allocate the revolutionary's newly acquired bounty. Further discussion is expected, but to begin with, a general direction must be charted."

 CHI.midgame.404.b: "정부를 안정화시키기 위해 사용해라"
 CHI.midgame.405.t: "The Needs of the People"
 CHI.midgame.405.d: "The Kuomintang's decision to redistribute seized property has proven broadly popular, and the discussion within the halls of power has turned towards how to best enact such a plan. Despite the socialist revolutionaries' egalitarian principles, unfortunately there has already been plenty of backdoor lobbying on where to best spend the influx of League riches. Cases of outright misallocation have been punished, but a focused direction becomes more and more necessary.\n\nAs a general trend, the RCA and their allies in the CSP have pushed for an injection of cash towards urban renewal. In their eyes, winning the urban proletariat is critical for jump-starting industry and giving the production base to win the Kuomintang's future wars. They point out that focusing spending in densely populated areas is more efficient for the limited resources available on hand. The PAC and affiliated factions have called for a distribution of aid for the farmers, who they argue are the backbone of the revolution thus far. With many facing famine conditions thanks to the disruption of war, greater spending there is the only way to bring peace to the countryside and consolidate Kuomintang bastions in the area.\n\nPlenty of moderates would like to do both, and have pushed for relatively even spending - even if it curtails the efficacy of either. They have been joined by a divergent voice coming from the Four Elders, who have stressed also the need for funding museums, conservatories, and other cultural institutions. In their eyes, the poor need not only material assistance but also to be able to appreciate the culture and beauty of their nation if they are to look forward to a new future."

 CHI.midgame.406.t: "국가의 필요"
 CHI.midgame.406.d: "A broad consensus is that the teetering Kuomintang government requires all the assets it can to prop it up. Since the government represents and is for the people, giving money to the state is the as giving it to the people. And sure enough, an infusion of wealth is the oil needed to grease the cogs of bureaucracy and the fuel to get the machine running.\n\nMetaphors aside, leading financial experts in the government have called for the payment of outstanding debts and to raise funding for the new government bureaucracy. Even in a socialist nation, the former is essential for maintaining faith in the government's ability to honour obligations, both externally and internally with salaries. The latter is vital for keeping the revolution running.\n\nOthers have called for the reopening of factories and the promotion of industrialisation in the country. They argue the return on investment will be high and a powerful industry is important not merely for giving an advantage over our rivals but also for the ultimate success of Chinese socialism.\n\nMembers of the military high command have lobbied for further resources to be applied to their own advanced projects, hoping to facilitate the adoption of modern technologies from abroad to win their wars. In their eyes, all other organs of state can wait until after unification to receive their full due."

 CHI.midgame.600.t: "Report from the MMIC"
 CHI.midgame.600.d: "In 1927, the Chinese revolution came to an abrupt halt when German intervention helped tilt the scales in favour of reactionary forces in the nation, dashing the hopes of idealists and socialists throughout the land. The Kuomintang and the League of Chinese Syndicalists were scatter to the winds, and the National Revolutionary Army broken.\n\nThis however, was not the end. The NRA proved its valour on the battlefield, a disciplined army trained by experienced socialist officers and educated in socialist doctrine. Initially led by Red Russian émigrés, the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine expanded to include officers from around the Internationale.\n\nBetween 1927-1936, the MMIC continued to train exiled NRA forces, creating a small but elite standing force of Chinese revolutionaries. Chinese operatives were periodically smuggled in and out of China, joining underground resistance movements.\n\nThanks to the inevitable instability caused by capitalist exploitation, the Chinese people finally gained another chance to break their shackles. In a daring, lighting revolt they overran much of China's eastern coastline, creating the revived National Revolutionary Government for which to challenge reactionary rule. The MMIC has been sent to assist them along their revolutionary path. They have eagerly written back home with giddy anticipation, with high hopes for China's future (and their own)."
 CHI.midgame.600.FRA: "$CHI.midgame.600.d$\n\nAs the long-time leader of the Internationale, French officers make up a large part of the military mission. André Malraux stands at the helm of the MMIC, an adventurer and writer whose revolutionary activities in the east made him an early candidate for the position. A man of action, thinker, and clever writer - his writings on the situation in China has been well received by the public. Jean Fontenoy, one of his lead deputies in charge of combat training, is sometimes said to be his shadowy reflection - another leftist writer-revolutionary adventurer, undoubtably brave but also addled by opium and with a growing sympathy for totalitarianism."
 CHI.midgame.600.ENG: "$CHI.midgame.600.d$\n\nThe deputy head of the mission is David Ramsay, a propagandist and labour organiser. He has thrown himself into his work - hoping to avoid a repeat of what happened in 1927 and in Russia.

 CHI.midgame.600.NOR: "$CHI.midgame.600.d$\n\nAmong our contribution to the mission is one Ingvald Berentin Aase, who has written at length against Norwegian extraterritoriality in China, has been integral in warming ties between ourselves and the Chinese.

 CHI.midgame.601.d: "If there was any doubt about the inescapable tide of history, the almost unstoppable successes of socialist forces in China surely proves it. Inspiring in their tenacity, the National Revolutionary Army has swept across northern China and successfully captured Beijing. This has allowed for [CHI.GetLeader] to deliver a speech before Tiananmen Square, a testament to the growing power of [CHI.GetNameDef].\n\nThese successes however, has not blinded their advisors in the MMIC from the realities the party still faces. With every passing day, [CHI.GetNameDef] is increasingly recognised as the legitimate government of China, a heavy burden to bear. Reactionary warlord forces within the country are likely to strike before the Kuomintang can consolidate their grip, and imperialist nations are weighing their options. Meanwhile, the Kuomintang are forced to contend with the perils of national leadership - including growing expectations from the people.\n\nWithin the party, divisions are growing. Wang Jingwei is beset with foes within the party, who are searching for an opportunity to depose him. Other advisors within the MMIC report a growing feud between mission head André Malraux and Deng Yanda, a prominent NRA general accused of leading a subversive clique of officers. Deng, they warn, is hardly the only one however willing to defy Wang's authority, or consolidating power around him."

 CHI.midgame.602.t: "The Reclus Plan"
 CHI.midgame.602.d: "The growing influence of the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine within the ranks of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army has opened up new opportunities, but also plenty of risk. Aid to [CHI.GetNameDef] has been limited by the long distance and our own equipment needs, but with modern equipment scarce in the Chinese theatre even a small amount can go a long way in elevating the fighting quality of Chinese units.\n\nOur advisors in the MMIC frequently harp on the possibility of a coup in the near future, even as they disagree about the likely source. André Malraux's personal animosity with Deng Yanda has drawn suspicion towards the WMARCA faction of the army, which unfortunately dominates the Old Guard along with the so-called \"India Clique\". He and many MMIC officers have supported the development of the \"Political Department\", affiliated with the civilian establishment and part of the NRA's \"Young Guard\". Others however believe we should back a horse other than the increasingly authoritarian Wang Jingwei, believing that empowering independent Syndicalist officers will help secure the long-term longevity and democracy of the Chinese revolution.\n\nJacques Reclus, a French anarchist that has joined the mission initially as an interpreter, has proposed a plan to divert weapons shipments towards sympathetic units in the NRA. The syndicalist movement in China is divided into factions of its own, and Reclus is connected to the (New) World Society faction, but most have traditionally found themselves sidelined by the NRA establishment regardless of affiliation. Helping support syndicalist led units would increase its influence but draw Old Guard ire.\n\nHearing of this plan, others have proposed modifying it to support their favourites in the Political Department. They see them the safer bet, given their status as a known quality within the army and the plan will likely receive the blessing of Chairman Wang."

 CHI.midgame.603.d: "Officers connected to the \"Political Department\" clique has had it's share of recent successes as of late, almost definitely thanks to the patronage of the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine. Most are \"Young Guard\" officers, trained in the Whampoa-in-exile, and taught the latest in military theory. Units associated with them have been chosen for important tasks and armed with the army's limited support of Western arms.\n\nThis has given Wang Jingwei the excuse he has needed to elevate them to positions of greater authority, promoting them to important staff and command posts at the expense of \"Old Guard\" affiliated officers. This has shored up the RCA's position within the military, a blow to the hopes of those hoping to capitalise on the RCA's military weakness for their own nefarious ends.\n\nZhou Enlai and his protege Nie Rongzhen have benefited from these developments as the ring-leaders of the clique. Nie in particular has been seen much more in public, shaking hands and rubbing shoulders with important civilian and military figures. Their rivals may be fuming, but there is little they can do about it - for now."

 CHI.midgame.604.t: "The Reclus Affair"
 CHI.midgame.604.d: "The National Revolutionary Army and their Internationale advisors have had a long history, but not always a positive one. In the Guangzhou period, they frequently sided with the left against Chiang Kai-shek's faction and even with the purge of right-wing elements it seems that the tensions continue into another decade.\n\nJacques Reclus is a French anarchist and a late-comer to the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine. More of a teacher and an intellectual, it appears he has tried his hand at scheming... unsuccessfully. A whistle-blower within the supply corps has accused him of redirecting valuable Western supply-shipments to Syndicalist aligned units, hoping to forestall a coup by the \"Old Guard\".\n\nInstead however, he has found himself at the centre of the latest source of tension between the military brass and their advisors. Deng Yanda has thrown his weight around, seeing an opportunity to undermine his rival André Malraux (whose direct involvement is questionable) and lambaste the lack of formal training of many MMIC leaders. In an unauthorised public appearance, he has even publicly raised the question of the necessity of the MMIC, arguing at this point their political (rather than military) training has done more harm than good. He has excoriated the politicisation of military affairs, demanding national unity in these troubling times.\n\nThe irony of the statement appears to have been lost on Deng, but that is the least of Wang Jingwei's worries. He and his inner circle were slighted by the MMIC's decision to side-step them in their plan, undermining his authority. The more obvious course of action would be to simply declare Reclus a persona non grata, despite the pleas of some of his anarchist friends in the World Society, sending him home to Paris. On the other hand, it does seem like Deng has gone too far this time, his premature celebration an interference in an active investigation. Perhaps this is the time to cut him down to size."

 CHI.midgame.605.d: "Whampoa was more than a mere school. Built in a small island in Guangzhou, it was the site where aspiring young revolutionaries trained not only in military tactics but also in ideology. The spirit, dedication, and camaraderie built in those halls has few equals, even if the physical site was only used for less than a decade. It is no surprise then that Whampoa has spawned multiple fraternities, close networks of alumni and former instructors bonded effectively for life through triumphs and tragedies.\n\nAlumni affiliations tend to be fluctuating, with far less clear divisions between \"left\" and \"right\" as it may superficially appear. Headmaster Chiang Kai-shek, for example, had many admirers among leftist cadets for his commitment to action and focus on battlefield spirit. But he has since passed on - resigned the mixed memory of history - the new man of the hour is no other than General Deng Yanda, himself a prominent instructor.\n\nHe commands a large following, perhaps the alumni network - the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association (WMARCA). Despite their affiliation with the \"Old Guard\" of the army, WMARCA also includes many promising young commanders such as Huang Qixiang, Wang Yaowu, and Du Yuming. They often dominated the upper ranks of the MinGan insurgency, a fact that they have been accused of leveraging to ensure favourable promotions for insiders. The WMARCA however, see themselves as the true bearers of the Whampoa spirit - courageous defenders of the revolution, the people, and the Three Principles."

 CHI.midgame.606.t: "What does the Kuomintang Represent"
 CHI.midgame.606.d: "With his recent premiership solidified, Chen Gongbo has officially announced the publication of his new treatise \"What does the Kuomintang Represent.\" Chen begins with an attack on Deng Yanda, Sun Fo, the Four Elders, and others for having encouraged party factionalism and thus losing the Party's capacity to lead the national revolution. In common Reorganisationist rhetoric, he advocates for an intensive house cleaning of the party while rejecting calls for a new Party or separate party.\n\nIn his recent work, Chen has assigned the Kuomintang, three missions: a national revolution, a world revolution, and a cultural revolution. China after all is not a colony nor is it a nation, rather it is an international colony - with losses in its financial, territorial, and judicial sphere. As an economist by background, he considers the loss of financial sovereignty the most painful of China's weaknesses. Chen believes that during the Great War, Britain's imperialistic domination of the world had been shaken dramatically but Germany's ultimate victory meant a revival of capitalism and reaction. This, he argues, explains why postwar Germany is governed for the most part by conservatives (the Zentrum government) and why Germany was leading Europe in a bulwark of reaction. Germany's intervention in the Northern Expedition therefore represents the reactionary imperialists attempting to stifle the natural progression of history.\n\nBut China's enemies do not lie purely with the German Eagle. Chen warns of the ever-hungry ambitions of the Empire of Japan, with Japan's presence in Manchuria a presence that must be dealt with during the National Revolution. As long as these two nations exist in China, there can be no freedom from economic imperialism - no end to a century of humiliation. By upholding a firm stance of anti-imperialism against two of China's greatest enemies, this is what the KMT should represent argues Chen."

The federation's goal (in the spirit of local democracy) is to unite various regional women's groups with the dual goals of building a socialist China and also to promote the status of women. Along with socialist youth groups for young girls, the ACDWF has also been instrumental in establishing various hospitals and schools for women within [CHI.GetNameDef].

 CHI.midgame.608.d: "While he may have flirted with anarchism in his youth, aside from Chen Gongbo within the RCA, no one is more infatuated with Marxism and materialism than Shi Cuntong, also known as Shi Fuliang. An early pioneer in the Chinese syndicalist movement, Shi is also known to hold connections and ties to Japanese leftists; However, he grew dissatisfied with the Chinese Syndicalist Party's leadership under Chen Duxiu and instead joined the Kuomintang.\n\nAs a member of the RCA's Radical wing and one of its most prolific writers, Shi's radicalism is considered to even surpass that of Chen Gongbo's. Shi writes that the Party should be democratised and linked with the masses with elections instituted at every level of party hierarchy. After all, it is the Party's blind faith in Bonapartists such as Deng Yanda or idealistic fools such as Sun Fo that has led to a degeneration in the national revolution. If the KMT is to emerge victorious, it must adopt a new revolutionary platform with a new revolutionary Three Principles of the People - Shi argues that the late Dr. Sun's doctrine could indeed be interpreted by materialism.\n\nShi profusely believes that class conflict is inevitable. In his view, Chinese society is dominated by imperialism - a feudal and patriarchal society. Within the feudal class there are warlord bureaucrats like Wu Peifu and Zhang Zuolin and the landlords; these classes collaborated with imperialism and sold out the nation for self-interest. The bourgeoisie would not participate in the revolution even if they once had; the bourgeoisie and compradors were already economically subservient to imperialism. Basing his observations on the 1932 uprising, Shi believes that the workers are at the forefront of the revolutionary movement, the future vanguard to lead China into national salvation."

 CHI.midgame.609.d: "Shanghai is in many ways the beating heart of the Chinese economy, and home to various groups both esteemed and unsavoury. The centre of Chinese trade, commerce, and finance it attracts individuals and groups from all walks of life. As a result, it has become a nexus point - a place where nationalists, republicans, and even socialists can gather in secluded spaces to talk business. The Kuomintang have long operated out of Shanghai, even with the creation of the International Mandate. Although Legation authorities periodically try to crack down on our activities, in such a big city it is easy to find a friend.\n\nChen Youren, who also goes by his birth name of Eugene depending on the circumstances, has plenty of experience navigating through this world, an estuary of revolution, crime, and privilege. As the foreign minister for a government seldom recognised by reactionary powers, he has nonetheless been careful to steer clear of KMT and LCS cells or the various gangs the revolution has periodically partnered with. Instead he has worked to solicit support from various upper-class contacts, ones the MinGan insurgency have previously worked with to keep them funded.\n\nAlthough divergent in their ultimate end goals, many of China's elites are nationalistic and republican. Although their views on the party have dimmed since the enthusiasm of 1911, plenty remain at least open to outreach either out of habit or idealism. With some careful choice of words and a rosy outlook, it is not difficult to secure their support. What's more intriguing is the growing number of aspiring contacts - people who wish to \"run with the wolves\" so to speak and be on the winning side. Various members of the Overseas Chinese Commission and members of the Vermillion Society have eagerly sought Chen's audience ever since our various victories across the nation."

Often bucking with the socialist orthodoxy, he has marched to his own step and gathered an alliance of those who claim to be loyal to the original ideals of the party and the \"true\" teachings of Dr. Sun.\n\nSun Fo (who prefers the Cantonese spelling of his name over the Mandarin Sun Ke) got his start in independent leadership as the Mayor of Guangzhou, then the revolutionary headquarters of the party. Serving multiple terms, he was expected to squeeze out resources from the city to furnish his father's army with supplies, but also proved to be an energetic administrator as well. He oversaw multiple grand infrastructure projects, the modernisation of legal codes, overhauled the bureaucracy, implemented some local democracy (albeit still under tutelage), and hoped to do so much more.\n\nAlthough ultimately he fell short of his ambitions, his driven but idealistic nature attracted like-minded souls to his side. This faction, then dubbed the \"Crown Prince Clique\" included close friends and fellow foreign-educated young intellectuals like Liang Hancao, Huang Hanliang, Wang Kunlun, and Wu Chaoshu (C.C. Wu). Time has aged all of them, and even now having morphed into the \"Reconstruction Faction\" they still feel like outsiders looking in to their own party. But in their quest to save their nation and the party of the Eternal Premier, they will push forward against all odds."

 CHI.midgame.611.d: "A long-held aspiration of the World Society was the creation of an institute modelled around one established in 1902 in Charleroi, Belgium. This University would be one for the workers, helping to mend class divisions by combining labour and education to allow for the creation of the \"labouring intellectual\". Fittingly, their slogan is to \"turn schools into factories and fields, and fields and factories into schools\", a high-minded aspiration meant to lay the groundwork for a peaceful future transition to anarchist state.\n\nCai Yuanpei, a leading Chinese educator and one of the \"Four Elders\" that make up the World Society, heads the preparatory committee for this university. With the help of their protege Yi Peiji, an educator now appointed as President of the University, they aspire to turn the National Labour University into a continuation of the old Frugal Work-Study Programme in France that generated so many idealists now in the party.\n\nThe institution is beset by problems, though none unsurmountable. Funding has been generously provided recently by the government, and there does seem to be a genuine eagerness even by rivals within the party for more universities accessible to the poor farmers and labourers who otherwise would not be able to afford an education. Still, their ambition to teach an anarchist interpretation of the Three Principles have raised eyebrows. In response, they cite examples of Dr. Sun's lectures that praise Proudhon and Bakunin over the Marxists. It remains to be seen whether or not such beliefs will ever take hold even among the faculty, but the Elders are confident that anarchism is an inevitability - even if it takes three thousand years to do so."

 CHI.midgame.612.d: "Dai Chunfeng was raised by a single mother, a woman who instilled in him a ceaseless drive for power but also a certain sense of Confucian filial piety - a loyalty that seems to carry over to the masters he latches on to. His latest one might very well be his ticket to the very heights of power in China. Dai sees his relationship to Hu Zongnan as akin the ones found in the ancient classics, conducting the \"labour of hound and horse\" (a reference to Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang) with utter loyalty for General Hu. Like the noble heroes of old, Dai's fealty to Hu begets his own expectations of nigh-feudal obligation from his own subordinates, and also his own expectation of requited honour from his master.\n\nOn a personal level, Dai lives alone with his guards and his servant Jia Jinnan, moving frequently between various safe-houses and residences so no one quite knows where he is. His leadership is personal, stressing (almost exaggeratedly) military discipline and relying on his nearly boundless energy, high attention to detail, and calculating mind. He prefers to use his own prodigious memory over modern filing systems, and works sometimes days on end.\n\nOn the other hand, he is also said to be erratic and paranoid at times, and a heavy drinker - unwilling to delegate out tasks to his warring lieutenants and clashing with Hu's other deputies. For his talk of humility and submission, he is not afraid to spread the word of his brutality - creating a very public image of a monster ruthlessly carrying out his master's tasks. There are very few willing to cross the \"Laoban\", and Hu Zongnan has found a very useful companion in him."

 CHI.midgame.613.d: "During the exile period, Song Ziwen made himself busy in Shanghai. While his sister continued to fight her revolution on the battlefields of MinGan, Song spent his time gathering money for her cause - but also thinking far ahead into the future. He has travelled around the world as an exile, making correspondences with fellow financial experts and economic planners. Few could have predicted the Kuomintang would ever return to this scale, so Song's work is either evidence of his foresight or arrogance.\n\nAll the same, one high profile exile he happened to have met was the Frenchman Jean Monnet, through a mutual contact in Ludwik Rajchman. They conceived of an idea for a channel for foreign financing into China, allowing them to promote major investments from abroad to stabilise the economy. However, given the anti-concessionist sentiment present after the 1936 Wuhu Incident, it has been decided that such funding must come from within China only.\n\nWith the help of the Song family's extensive connections, Song Ziwen's personal status as Minister of Finance, and party leadership like Li Shizeng, the Chinese Development Finance Corporation has been established. With the help of major allied banks in China, they have sought to finance major infrastructure, business, and resource extraction projects across the nation - a first step in the national reconstruction.\n\nUsing a public-private model, their efforts have been hampered by the realities of war but have helped support the Kuomintang's efforts at diminishing their reliance on Imperialist powers for capital. If things go the way Song hopes, this may be the foundation on which the party's state-capitalist programme is built upon."

 CHI.midgame.800.d: "\"A society of art for art's sake,\" say the leftist writers who argue that the National Revolution of the Chinese Revolution is not merely a revolution against imperialism or society but rather a revolution of culture. In the early days, these so-called \"new writers\" found themselves drawn to romanticism as opposed to naturalism - advocating art for art's sake and emphasising the individual, Following the tragedy of the Shanghai Massacre on May 30th, leftist journalists, artists, writers began to gravitate towards the proletarian movement - art was to be a tool in the natural dialectic Marxist progression of the social revolution.\n\nLed by artistic intellectuals such as Guo Moruo, Chang Fangwu, and Yu Dafu have organised themselves in an artistic circle known as the Creation Society with other prominent socialists to write on and critique Chinese society as well as to address the future proletarian revolution. They are also joined by groups such as the League of Left-Wing Writers in the Legation Cities, with the Legation Cities being a prominent hotbed of left-wing literary and cinematic activity due to the perceived capitalistic oppression of foreign imperialism.\n\nWithin the Kuomintang, more radical Marxists in the Party, such as those amongst the RCA, have clamoured for the observance of Karl Marx's birthday, May Day, and the anniversary of the Paris Commune. For the Provisional Action Committee, however, while the clique openly supports leftist art and culture - they have nonetheless shown opposition and fear of ideologues like Chen Gongbo, who advocate for the necessity of a cultural revolution. Citing that the social revolution and revolution against imperialism are more important in the here and now, they have denounced Chen's suggestions for a revolution against existing cultural institutions."

 CHI.midgame.801.d: "As the poor peasant has come to symbolise within the revolutionary left the nature of the oppressed Chinese countryman, leftist artists have turned to create works of revolutionary art to portray their struggles, poverty, and potential for greatness.\n\nPrevalent within the artistic community is a group of woodcarvers encouraged by the esteemed leftist writer Lu Xun. Lu Xun publicly endorsed woodcarving as he felt that the brush swabs of traditional Chinese painting and the eloquence of Western oil painting did not care too much about social reality; meanwhile, woodcarving is close to life and readily accepted by the masses. Moreover, this is also simply for the reason that \"woodcarving is easy to do.\" In 1931, an art exhibition was held in Shanghai which displayed some woodcarving works by young left-wing artists,\n\nSince the Kuomintang's explosive victory in the League War, woodcarvers have turned to portray the struggle of the peasants as their main foci. This is seen at the titles of their works which mainly deal with floods and famines; for example, the artist Duan Ganqing has produced two works: \"Life After a Great Disaster,\" \"Where is Our Home,\" and \"Famine.\" Meanwhile, writing on the poor Sichuan harvest, works have been created in response to the depravity of famine conditions: \"The Symphony of Hunger\" (Zhang Ying), \"Collapse on the Road because of Hunger\" (Zhang Hui), \"The Hungry Throng\" (Luo Qingzhen)."

 CHI.midgame.802.d: "Despite being largely sidelined from major policymaking decisions by the Kuomintang's leftist leadership due to his right-leaning beliefs, that has not stopped Sun Fo from being busy in his lifelong goal of promoting his father's teachings (through the lens of his own interpretation of his father's will). In some ways, carrying on the burden of preserving and disseminating his father's work is a means for which the younger Sun connects with his distant parent beyond the grave.\n\nAside from his activities in the government, legislature, and party politics, Sun Fo has also been a noted sponsor for culture. His lieutenants Zhong Tianxin and Huang Shenzhi have formed the Chinese Cultural Association which publishes the magazine \"Creation\". Their most recent endeavour, however, far outstrips a petty magazine in ambition. The Sun Yat-sen Institute for the Advancement of Culture and Education aims to study Dr. Sun's ideas in relationship to general Chinese culture.\n\nAlthough it has received praise (albeit muted) from party leaders, its actual agenda of rallying liberal scholars and thinkers together has cast suspicion about Sun's ambitions. Sun has expressed in private his desire to attract the youth away from what he sees as Marxist influence back towards the Three Principles. The institute has announced plans to release an English-language journal called Tianxia Monthly, no doubt to sway foreign opinion, and a domestic oriented \"Compilation of Current Events\".\n\nContaining its influence however, in the end might simply just be a matter of ignoring it. Although Sun insists that the institute be funded through private donations as a means of maintaining a reputation for impartiality and independence from the government, in practice he has leveraged his sway over the Executive Yuan and municipal governments for donations. This money has allowed the Institute to secure the contribution of famous scholars, and quietly turning the faucet off would choke their activities."

 CHI.midgame.803.d: "As the Revolution continues, the grinding gears of state machinery often takes an oppressive form. Long accustomed to evading reactionary censorship, with the shoe now on the other foot the Kuomintang has not hesitated to suppress media unfavourable to their cause. A myriad of restrictions have slowly been put into place, either officially or unofficially, and censors deployed into relevant telegraph stations. With many rural citizens illiterate, Kuomintang control of information can be concentrated in the cities.\n\nThe Central Executive Committee has passed the Revised Standards for News Censorship, giving considerable authority to the Central News Agency in setting guidelines for all newspapers. Censors often have wide latitude in interpreting restrictions, causing a race for publishers to find ways around them. What's perhaps interesting too is that such aggressive government actions against \"counter-revolutionary\" works seems to have rubbed off on the students, who also regularly target critical press on their own initiative.\n\nIn the world of culture, there have been plenty of artists of all types sympathetic to the revolution. Many however have chafed under these restrictions, and complain the Kuomintang are little better than their predecessors. Indeed, many publishing companies have begun to self-censor out of fear of offending government sensibilities. Although at this point most have given up on halting the government from suppressing public criticism, prominent intellectuals have made the case that the arts require at least some creative freedom - particularly those aligned with revolutionary values."

 CHI.midgame.805.d: "Within the Reorganised Comrades Association, few can hardly dispute that the clique's primary ideological stance is guided by none other than Chen Gongbo, the dynamic revolutionary socialist who studied Economics at Columbia University from 1922-1924.  Associated with syndicalists early on in his political career and a founding member of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, Chen developed a passionate interest in Marxism while overseas. Intellectually, he describes himself as believing in \"historicism,\" a common euphemism for Marx's materialism - like all orthodox Marxists, Chen holds that politics and institutions are merely the reflections of economic structures.\n\nA frequent publisher in the Revolutionary Critic, Chen has recently published his magnum opus - \"Revolution and Thought.\" In this work, he coined the expression \"dynamic materialism\" to describe his weltanschauung (world-view), holding that matter and motion are the basic constituents of the world.\n\nIn the concluding passages of his work, Chen notes that he had originally found fault with Marx's writings that capitalism would lead to its destruction. After all, he pointed out that although the Great War - Germany had survived and sustained itself, exploiting their colonies strengthened capitalism, an idea never anticipated by Marx. However, with the recent collapse of the German economy following Black Monday, Chen writes that for China to be free, she must pursue her own independent revolutionary direction, and the KMT party organ must be reorganised to perfection to execute such anti-imperialism. With the demise of capitalism world wide, Chen muses - there is finally a chance for the National Revolution to succeed."

 CHI.midgame.806.d: "Described as the second most prominent intellectual within the Reorganised Comrades Association and the de facto leader of the RCA \"Moderates\", Gu Mengyu was never a Marxist-oriented intellectual like his radical peers in the RCA. Prior to joining the Kuomintang in early 1925, Gu was a registrar and head of the economics department of Peking University. While he holds a good understanding of Marxism, he does not subscribe to materialism, nor did he think that economic structures were the primary factor in understanding history.\n\nIn his new work \"On Historical Materialism\", he disputes the validity of dialectical and historical materialism earning harsh criticism and woeful boos from the Radical Faction of the RCA. Gu writes the evidence presented by Marx and Engels were merely metaphysics and that dialectical materialism unlocking the logic of nature was just a form of metaphysics since it is not based on empirical grounds. As to historical materialism, Gu did not think that economic structures were the ultimate determinant for superstructure. He argues that human knowledge, science, education, and ethics play just as an important role on economic development.\n\nDenouncing orthodox Marxism as \"a religious doctrine\", Gu's writings have earned acclaim from non-Marxists within the Kuomintang and those in the RCA who do not subscribe to the ideas of materialism. Despite praise from his camp, sales for \"On Historical Materialism\" have nonetheless fallen short compared to the popularity of Chen Gongbo's latest work."

 CHI.midgame.807.d: "Despite her \"bourgeois\" background as the daughter of a gentry family, Ding Ling, born Jiang Bingzhi, studied at the progressive Hunan Provincial No.1 Normal School for Girls, where she became classmates with her future revolutionary comrade Xiang Jingyu. Inspired by her mother, from an early start - Ding Ling found her calling in the politics of the national and social revolution.\n\nInvolved in left-wing circles and acquainted with figures such as Qu Qiubai and her future husband Hu Yepin; Ding nevertheless maintained her own feminist stance by even initially turning down Hu's marriage proposals as a way to demonstrate her own free will. Associated with the so-called \"New Women's Movement\" in literature, her book \"Miss Sophia's Diary\" caused a sensation within the Chinese literary world for its provocative nature of sexuality and emotional desires. Despite her presence in Shanghai, Ding Ling herself travelled to the MinGan insurgent zone to observe the status and role of women in the national revolution; following her journey, she has recently published her magnum opus \"Thoughts on March 8th\" regarding women in the MinGan Zone.\n\nPrefacing her essay by emphasising that women in the MinGan zone hold better lives than women of other provinces of China - women in the MinGan zone have yet to achieve total liberation from their presupposed beliefs that they must bear children and be in marriage. As a self-declared \"Syndicalist\", she covers controversial topics such as the right to remain unmarried, the right to divorce, and the right to abortion. She then describes how women can improve their mental and physical well-being as a means of feminist empowerment before describing that women must not wait to be saved but must take it upon themselves to achieve revolution, even if that means going against the Kuomintang and other revolutionary parties. While acclaimed by feminists, Ding Ling's work has undoubtedly aroused irritation and criticism from more conservative elements of the revolution."

 CHI.midgame.808.t: "The Datong in Socialist Thought"
 CHI.midgame.808.d: "The term and notion of the datong can be traced back to the Liji (Book of Rites), where it denotes a world of harmony and universal welfare based on the unselfish behavior of all members of society. Throughout the centuries of Chinese civilisation, this idea of datong was revived and by the late 19th century, it was being incorporated into the concepts of Chinese revolutionaries and reformers.\n\nA common term in anarchist, socialist, and even Marxist texts - datong has been used to describe a future socialist society. The Marxist writer and syndicalist Guo Moruo's essay \"Marx Enters the Confucian Temple\", imagines an encounter between Confucius and Marx where the philosophers agree that their ideas are compatible. A term popular amongst the Provisional Action Committee who cite Dr. Sun's own usage of datong in the Party's anthem, the term is also popular amongst the Party's anarchist elders in the World Society. According to Li Shizeng, history moves in revolutions with the first revolution being monarchical revolution, the revolution for people's sovereignty, the revolution for class, and the final revolution for the datong. Of these revolutions: the establishment of the archaic Shang and Zhou dynasties fit the first revolution; the American, French, and Xinhai revolutions were of the second type; the Syndicalist Revolutions of France and Britain were the third types, and the final revolution is to come - the revolution advocated by Proudhon which carries out the ideals of Minsheng according to Dr. Sun.\n\nTo the Chinese Syndicalist Party, while the datong represents an ideal society without current ills, it also is inspired by the Commune of France, the first state to put socialism into practice. Generally speaking these writers converge on a vision of an industrialised China based on the \"masses\", guided by worker's unions, and with social/cultural facilities available to all. In this world, there shall be economic planning, industrialisation, agricultural collectivisation, the socialisation of property, social infrastructures, the rights and duties for all to work, and equal political statuses. The French method will inspire cities across China, luscious and green neighbourhood \"garden cities\" - the ideal utopia for a true syndicalist China."

Delegates affiliated with both the Provisional Action Committee and Reorganised Comrades Association readily agreed that extensive radio broadcasting must be utilised in order to promote the danghua - the \"party-fication\" of Chinese society.\n\nOne of the Ministry's first accomplishments thus far was the revitalisation of the \"Minguo Ribao\" or the \"People's Daily.\" Established as early as 1923 when the Nationalist Party was based in Shanghai, the newspaper was forced to flee overseas upon the failure of the Northern Expedition. Written in the Chinese vernacular, the Minguo Ribao is to be one pillar in the Nationalist propaganda system, placed under the guidance of the Central Daily News and the Central News Agency.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Communications opened a new bureaucratic office named the Telecommunications Office to handle radio communication and broadcasting. Initial plans drawn up with the help of Western engineers have ambitiously envisioned a 500-watt transmitter covering the area between Nanjing and Shanghai. Designed to facilitate the organisation of local level party work as well as commence the danghua, the effort to improve communications throughout the country has so far exceeded expectations.\n\nWith growing excitement, those fluent and literate in the Nanjing Dialect of Mandarin have been encouraged to serve as technicians in the growing number of radio stations throughout the country, emphasising its expanding reach.

In a show of filial piety, she joins the army in her father's place (disguising herself as a man) and courageously helps fight off invading barbarian nomads. Throughout she demonstrates her heroism, courage, and humility.\n\nHailing traditional virtues of honour and valour, the film was an immediate success and raised patriotic feelings throughout the nation. It has broken records for how long it was in theatres, and caused an inevitable flood of comparisons to the current Chinese situation, with the nation still reeling from years of foreign violations of its sovereignty.

We learn that these friends are unemployed in Shanghai as a result of the financial fiasco of Black Monday that severely depleted the city's economic strength. Meanwhile, a female graduate Yang (played by Bai Yang) moves next to Zhao as Zhao finds a job in the Minguo Ribao of the Kuomintang. A light-hearted feud breaks out between the two neighbours.\n\nHowever, what has become a light romance between Zhao and Yang, suddenly ends when Yang announces to Zhao one day that she is leaving Shanghai as the factory that she had been working in, had closed down. Zhao tries to convince Yang to stay but she decides to leave anyway. Yang's friend, who recognises their romance, convinces Yang to stay in Shanghai.\n\nZhao finds that he himself is out of work.

Just last year, he developed chronic tuberculosis and for the past few weeks, he has been in declining health. The Nationalist government officially offered their condolences.\n\nLu Xun began his literary career as did any other Chinese intellectual of the pre-Republican era, by studying the Confucian classics in preparation for the civil examinations. Lu Xun's father and grandfather were caught in a bribery scandal that saw his grandfather imprisoned and his father falling victim to a cruel addiction to opium. After attending school where he became exposed to Western ideals, Lu Xun travelled to Japan in 1902 on a government scholarship and began translating famous Western works into vernacular Chinese.\n\nUpon witnessing a photograph of a Chinese civilian being beheaded by a Japanese soldier during the Russo-Japanese War and seeing the utter apathy in the eyes of the Chinese bystanders, Lu Xun was convinced that China was in need of salvation. By the time the Xinhai Revolution arrived in 1911, he had ascended to a position of scholarship in Beijing. In 1917, he began writing for Chen Duxiu's \"New Youth\" where he published his successful short story \"Diary of a Madman.\" He followed this success in 1927 with his grand work, \"The True Story of Ah Q.\"\n\nA sympathetic individual towards the Kuomintang, Lu Xun served as a guest lecturer at Whampoa and the Zhongshan University on the eve of the Northern Expedition. After the expedition's failure, he fled for Shanghai although he remained sympathetic to Song Qingling's guerrilla war in Fujian.

This new cinematic masterpiece, which has been declared China's first horror film, is directed by the leftist-leaning director Ma-Xu Weibang. It draws influence from the 1923 American film \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" and the 1910 French novel, \"Le Fantôme de l'Opera.\"\n\nCritics of the film have pointed out that the anxious tones of the horror genre seem to emulate the very anxiety the Chinese people hold in regard to the ever-changing political landscape of the land. Furthermore, the film's leftist and nationalist characters have led to the Kuomintang officially endorsing the film.\n\nStarring the handsome actor Jin Shan as Song Danping and the beautiful actress Hu Ping as Li Xiaoxia (Song Danping's lover), the film is set on a dark and stormy night in 1926. A group of actors arrive at a demolished theatre and begin practising for their show. One night, the play's lead, Sun Xiao'ou requests to practise his parts by himself, but he struggles with the lines. As he continues to rehearse, a mysterious voice suddenly lends its voice to the actor, helping him learn the lines. The actor decides to seek out this benevolent angel and finds that the voice belongs to none other than the famed actor Song Danping, who was thought to have been deceased.\n\nIn flashbacks, Danping reveals that prior to acting he had been a revolutionary in the Second Revolution against Yuan Shikai. After the revolution's failure, he fled into hiding and fell in love with Li Xiaoxia. Danping's rival Tang Jun, however, has Danping tortured and attacked with acid. Embarrassed and ashamed of his visceral scars, Danping flees into hiding once more - which drives Xiaoxia to insanity. He spends his nights in the theatre, alone and hidden, comforting a mentally unstable Xiaoxia.\n\nIn the present day, the actor troupe makes it to their show and presents it to none other than the theatre's owner, Tang Jun. Tang takes a liking to Sun's girlfriend and tries to seize her when Sun fights back. In the struggle, Sun's lover dies but Danping emerges out of hiding to fight Tang Jun. The theatre viewers see Danping as a monster due to his disfigured face and attempt to chase him with torches.

She is a music teacher for a girls' school, although she holds deep aspirations to become a writer. Her neighbour Aying is a factory worker, and Wei Ming teaches the factory workers patriotic songs - raising their spirits to a dream of liberation. Dr. Wang (played by Wang Naidong) is the principal of Wei Ming's school who is infatuated with the young woman, and wants her to be his concubine. Nonetheless, she turns away from him - instead, she chases the disinterested Yu Haichou, an editor. Angered, Dr. Wang fires Wei Ming just as Wei Ming's illegitimate daughter and sister arrive in Shanghai begging for money.\n\nWei Ming's daughter is sick with pneumonia but the sisters cannot pay the hospital fee. Without income as a teacher, Wei Ming attempts to request advance payment for her novel \"Tomb of Love\" but the publisher refuses. Distraught and without options, she prostitutes herself and unexpectedly her first client is Dr. Wang. After being mocked by the principal, she hits him and then runs away just to watch her daughter to die. Having given up hope, Wei Ming overdoses on pills - as she dies in her friends' arms, she cries out \"I want to live, I want revenge!\" The film ends solemnly with Aying and the factory workers walking out of the factory."

 CHI.midgame.851.d.lkmt: "The return of the [FROM.FROM.GetRulingParty] into the Kuomintang revolutionary fold was not unexpected given their common political roots and open sympathy for the [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] government. But [FROM.FROM.GetLeader]'s submissions to our cause has been a two-way street, not only have we influenced [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] local politics, they have also begun to exert their influence on us.\n\nThe primary beneficiary of this renewed alliance have been the Provisional Action Committee, with delegates of [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] already beginning to side with Song Qingling and her faction in domestic affairs. Their populist, agrarian platform has won them many friends among local leftist groups, often marginalised from the urban centre of national politics.\n\nThe regional nature of [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] rule should not be overlooked as well. Although they, like all Kuomintang factions, promote a generally centralist and nationalist agenda, the realities of taking power in [FROM.FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] often required military might and regional connections, lending them more amenable to opposition politics over Wang Jingwei's centralised power-base."
 CHI.midgame.851.d.rkmt: "The submission of [FROM.FROM.GetRulingParty] back into the Kuomintang revolutionary fold is a promising, if challenging development for the party. The two share a common root in Sun Yat-sen's 1924 iteration of the Nationalist party, but have since diverged only to apparently coalesce again under Wang Jingwei's leadership. But this has hardly been a unilateral affair, despite what the central authorities in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] might say.\n\n[FROM.FROM.GetLeader] has thrown his [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] influence behind existing rightist factions in the central government, leading to an upswing in support for the Reconstruction Faction. Sun Fo has been happy to absorb his new allies, securing them important posts where he could. This has destabilised the party somewhat, reminding many of the old divisions that once sundered the party's hopes of unification.\n\nMoreover, there remain plenty of divisions between the primarily intellectual, civilian Reconstruction Faction which have always tended to remain towards the centre of power and their new-found friends in [FROM.FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Still, as long as we recognise [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] and his allies as the governor of [FROM.FROM.GetName], their influence is likely here to stay."
 CHI.midgame.851.d.rep: "The submission of [FROM.FROM.GetRulingParty] back into the Kuomintang revolutionary fold harkens back to the old Constitutional Protection Alliance of Sun Yat-sen, bringing disparate and ostensibly democratic groups together to resist a common reactionary, warlord enemy. This has not been without mutual intermingling of political streams however.\n\n[FROM.FROM.GetLeader]'s recognition of Wang Jingwei's leadership marks a great victory for the embattled chairman, allowing him to flex his long-touted diplomatic skills. His allies in the Reorganised Comrades Association have used this to shore up his position against his enemies, propelling a narrative that he is the new Sun Yat-sen - one of the few men able to keep a united front of republicans together in face of the harsh winds of reactionarism.\n\nThe reality on the ground is more mundane. [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] and his government in [FROM.FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] are hardly rushing to implement Kuomintang party-state rule or bend their own held beliefs to the party's socialist interpretation of the Three Principles. Odds are, they are playing a wait-and-see game, calculating [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s apparent strength makes them the most advantageous ally of the moment."
 CHI.midgame.851.d.other: "The capitulation of [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] to the Kuomintang revolutionary fold was a pleasant, if not necessarily unexpected surprise to [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The reactionary warlords that make up the [FROM.FROM.GetRulingParty] tended to be a pragmatic sort, and this latest change in uniform is probably only natural - switching from one master to a newer, redder one. This wise decision to accept the Kuomintang ultimatum has probably saved thousands of lives, at least for now, though that fact (widely publicised by the party's propaganda machine) could hardly wash the taste of disgust from the mouthes of party hardliners.\n\nIndeed, underneath the pomp and ceremony of the recent \"changing of the flags\" in [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef], the political reality will likely remain largely unchanged in [FROM.FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Life will go on, probably under a hiearchy of local reactionary autocrats, who may at best adopt Kuomintang regalia as a fashion statement and play lipservice to the ideals they represent, but otherwise will disgrace our party's message.\n\nWang Jingwei and other authorities that brokered this agreement promise that they will provide adequate oversight into [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] affairs and ultimately [FROM.FROM.GetName]'s \"unorthodoxy\" will be rendered moot upon national unification.

 CHI.midgame.901.d: "The Kuomintang and the Federalists have common roots in Guangzhou, with many early members having participated in the Constitutional Protection War against the tyranny of the would-be Emperor Yuan Shikai. This alliance between Sun Yat-sen and Chen Jiongming soon came to blows over Sun's increasing authoritarianism and Chen's willingness to negotiate with the Beiyang government after Yuan's death. The ensuing coup has left a lasting enmity between the two factions which persists to this day.\n\nWith the return of the Kuomintang in China's eastern five provinces, it seems that they are once more a contender in Chinese national politics and a rival to our own ambitions. Their eyes however are fixated northwards, hoping to resume their northern expedition and topple the Beiyang warlords located there. Using some back-channels and his various contacts within the Federalist movement, Chairman Wang Jingwei has sent emissaries hoping to broker a non-aggression treaty between our respective governments to combat the greater threat posed by our northern rivals.\n\nGiven the wide ideological distance between our respective camps and the bitter history between us, it is unlikely that such a pact can hold for long. There are certainly plenty within the Kuomintang who are bound to be opposed to any agreement with us. But stranger things have happened before in Chinese history, and the warlord era is no ordinary time."

 CHI.midgame.902.d: "After some secret negotiations between representatives of [FROM.GetLeader] and Wang Jingwei, the Chairman has finally received the telegram he has so anxiously been waiting for: the Federalists have accepted our proposal for a non-aggression pact. This frees up our hand when it comes to China's southern region and will allow us to better focus on our ambitions to restart the Northern Expedition.\n\nWang Jingwei has summoned the Central Executive Committee with the proposal, presenting it suddenly and ambushing the Provisional Action Committee. Wang knows well enough what their responses will be - their vision coloured by their scalding hatred of Chen Jiongming and his followers. After all, everyone knows how the treacherous Chen betrayed Dr. Sun in vain hopes of an accord with the Beiyang warlords and later happily worked as a Zhili stooge after the first Northern Expedition collapsed. Song Qingling in particular is said to blame Federalist shelling during Chen's coup for causing her to miscarriage.\n\nWhatever the case, forcing through the agreement before the Central Executive Committee was a must if Wang was to ensure its passage - plenty of RCA members were also sceptical of the agreement. The only others who seemed willing to look past the bad blood for a temporary arrangement are the Reconstruction Faction, who were integral for gaining the slim majority needed for passage. Wang seems to have lost a considerable amount of support thanks to this affair, but if it ensures the Second Northern Expedition is far more successful than the first, perhaps it is a necessary evil."

Whether out of lingering bad blood from the end of the old Constitutional Protection Movement, continuing ideological rivalry, competing ambitions or simply a lack of trust between both sides, there will be no deal between China's two major southern republican movements.\n\nWang has done his best to keep the talks a secret, and tried to bury the fact that any negotiations took place, but to no avail. It seems that there were enough spies within the Presidential palace that a broad outline of transpired found their ways into the hands of various radical newsources, who have naturally spun an unfavourable narrative for the Chairman.\n\nWang's public relations team have been working overtime to try and dispel the rumours, though the fact that he was willing to negotiate with Sun's old enemies has made him seem weak and unscrupulous. The fact that they failed were of little saving consequence either: his reputation as a negotiator is in tatters. Revolutionary sentiment it seems has hardened in southern China only one vision for the future of the nation will emerge in the end."

 CHI.midgame.911.t: "A Kuomintang Pact?"
 CHI.midgame.911.d: "The original Kuomintang was founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen as a successor to the broad-tent Tongmenghui, the success of which was marred by its corruption by Yuan Shikai and his clique of Beiyang warlords. The ambiguity of the late founder of the party's Three Principles and his shift leftwards from his initial liberal, nationalistic base was one of the primary (albeit politely ignored) root of the Kuomintang's later schism following his deeath.\n\nHaving consolidated tremendous power around himself and his cult of personality, Sun's influence within the burgeoning Guangzhou revolutionary government was only exceeded by the disparateness of the coalition he had rallied around himself. In the power-struggle that broke out in wake of his death, the left, right, centre, and military factions competed for power - much to the detriment of the revolution as a whole. The final blow to any chance at party unity came with the failure of the Northern Expedition. The Kuomintang splinters scattered to the winds, and most figured they were better off alone.\n\nIt seems fate has brought us back together again, with now competing rival Kuomintang governments in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The ideological divide between the two Kuomintang central committees are too great to bridge, however many former Whampoa classmates and military comrades between our camps have sought to broker at least a temporary non-aggression pact as we prepare to fight the far greater threat of Beiyang warlords to the north. After all, given that the National Revolutionary Army failed to bring down Beiyang in 1927 as a united force, it is doubtful we can do it alone now."

 CHI.midgame.912.d: "After days of hushed negotiations between various intermediaries of the [FROM.GetRulingParty] and the NRA high command, a general truce has been agreed upon between our rival Kuomintang governments for an indefinite period. This agreement, signed by [FROM.GetLeader] and Deng Yanda will allow both sides to free up forces for a future continuation of the Northern Expedition, allowing the Kuomintang to put Beiyang in its grave once and for all.\n\nThis agreement with the rightists in our party, which have devolved into warlordism and ideological heresy, has deeply unsettled many. Hardliners and even more moderate socialists have denounced this agreement as perverse, and condemned the mechanism in which it was brought about. Although Wang Jingwei and the Central Executive Committee have given their tacit approval for this deal, the RCA have made it known their displeasure at the military's overreach - accusing them of putting their Whampoa days camaraderie in front of the needs of the the people.\n\nIn any case, there has been a palatable shift in favour of the Chairman and the party orthodoxy as the backlash rises. The PAC and RF have been notably silent on the matter, trying to distance themselves from the actions of their aligned commanders.

For all the talk of camaraderie and shared fond memories of Whampoa/the old National Revolutionary Army, the distrust between the two camps was too great to overcome. It seems that there will be no peace between the warring central committees, and both have embraced the reality that there will be no reconcilation.\n\nThe breakdown of these talks was to be expected but nonetheless the backlash has been fierce. The dishonesty of the [FROM.GetAdjective] leadership and the willingness of so many in the National Revolutionary Army and Kuomintang establishment to tolerate talks with them has disillusioned many avowed socialists. The Kuomintang is willing to talk tough, railing against warlords and reactionaries, but are willing to accommodate them as they see fit.\n\nMany now see the Kuomintang as too insular to detach themselves from their personal interests and connections to traitors. They turn to alternatives, particularly the radicals in the Chinese Syndicalist Party, hoping for a future generally free from the corruption of the warlord era."

 CHI.lategame.000.d: "About a decade ago, Chiang Kai-shek addressed his officers on the eve of the Northern Expedition:\n\n\"The importance of this fight is not only in that it will decide the fate of the warlords. But, whether or not the Chinese nation and race can restore their freedom and independence hangs in the balance. In other words, it is a struggle between the nation and the warlords, between the revolution and the counter-revolutionaries, between the Three People's Principles and imperialism.\"\n\nThe Kuomintang was knocked down then, but the fight never ended. Today, the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth finally was raised over a changed Beijing as party members (both those that witnessed the first expedition and those that joined in the interim) cheered on. As [CHI.GetLeader] and other party members delivered their speeches, soldiers paraded, and experts speculated about the future there was little doubt of the significance of the moment: victory.\n\nYes, victory. Victory over the warlords. Victory over the counter-revolutionaries. Victory over imperialism. Chiang and many others did not live to see the moment but their legacy is secured. The Kuomintang has proven themselves capable of more than just words, casting down the institutions they so hated.\n\nEven if resistance continues and enemy pockets are mopped up, the nation is changing. Socialism appears more and more as a credible future for China and the Kuomintang no longer merely a fringe party. But threats remain. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and the party's newfound legitimacy has drawn the attention of a host of foes both at home and abroad. Meanwhile it fights to avoid being undone by the influx of opportunists, divisions, and new responsibilities. The people now expect them to lead, and that's often far more difficult than to overthrow."

 CHI.lategame.001.t: "The Second Repatriated Congress of the Kuomintang is Convened"
 CHI.lategame.001.d: "As the flag of the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth now flies above the Tiananmen Gate above a recently installed portrait of the late eternal premier Dr. Sun Yat-sen, calls have gone out throughout the country to convene a special emergency session of the National Congress. While traditionally orthodox party doctrine has called for these meetings every four years, the developments of the national Revolution have instead suspended this procedure in favour of calling sessions when needed.\n\nChairman [CHI.GetLeader] once again has been given the honour of opening the Congress to commemorate the success of the Northern Expedition, but observers of the Congress remark that the mood within the delegates is considerably more tense than the first Congress. There are certainly rumours in the dark of knives being sharpened, especially amongst those who oppose Chairman Wang's gravitation towards authoritarianism. While the [CHI.GetNameDef] now controls the former imperial capital of Beijing, strengthening its legitimacy as a national unifier; there is still much work to do to win the people's hearts and minds and drive the Japanese imperialists out of China once and forever.\n\nThe Congress has also seen greater participation of revolutionary women within the ranks of the Kuomintang. Most notable are those such as Deng Yingchao, Zeng Xing, Cai Chang, and Xiang Jingyu (who all hold long ties with the Chinese socialist movement) but also newcomers such as the wife of the Uygur politician Burhan Shadidi and the deputy director of Xinjiang Women's Federation - Rashida. Furthermore, in attendance are members of the Internationale Military Mission in China, yet another reminder of the Internationale's staunch support for the success of the socialist Chinese Revolution. And without further ado, Wang's concluding remarks on the importance of unity drew only polite applause as the Congress delegates began to take the floor."
 CHI.lategame.001.a: "Well get on with it!"
 CHI.lategame.002.t: "Grand Ambitions for a New Republic"
 CHI.lategame.002.d: "First on the Congress' agenda was to implement the Party state's mass bureaucracy into a greater national form. The Kuomintang is to be not only a political organ for the next pivotal years of political tutelage but also a guiding force to train and teach the masses revolutionary consciousness so that the Chinese people themselves could finally stand up to imperialism. As such, a near unanimous vote has approved proposals to establish a formal Ministry of Education and a National Health Administration.\n\nThe Ministry of Education is to be led by one of the Four Elders of the Kuomintang and a member of the World Society, Cai Yuanpei. Cai, who commands a great amount of prestige due to his work in the reform of Beijing University nearly a decade earlier, is himself a philosophical anarchist and advocates combining labour and learning in education. Basic to the conception of a new revolutionary education is the recruitment of students and labourers into the education system - thus ending the monopolisation of education by the wealthy. Along with the planned construction of the Academia Sinica, there will also be an Industrial Labour College, an Agricultural Labour College, and a Social Sciences College (the third choice reflecting the anarchist ideals that the social sciences and social revolution were inseparable).\n\nRural health conditions in the Chinese countryside are utterly deplorable by modern medicine standards, in some cases, midwives resort to using cow dung or mud to stop the bleeding during delivery. The promotion of public health is seen not only as an extension of Minsheng (the people's welfare) but also reflects Dr. Sun's belief that a physically strong people could not be so easily conquered. As a result, a National Health Administration has been founded by the Ministry of the Interior; its goals are to create mobile clinics, and public health stations, enforce vaccinations, and train local midwives/nurses in modern medicine techniques. With pressure from the PAC, the Administration's first experimental health clinics will be established in the former MinGan Zone."

 CHI.lategame.003.t: "The Language Issue"
 CHI.lategame.003.d: "As the Congress drags on, one of the main questions to answer is that of language. Nearly 300 million native speakers of its northern dialect of Mandarin in China. In the South, there are 37 million who speak Wu (the dialect of Zhejiang), 22 million speak Cantonese, 20 million speak Hakka, and several million speak the Fujian dialect. During the wars of unification, there were undoubtedly incidents in which language unfamiliarity led to chaos within the armed forces and across the country.\n\nWhile the Northern Chinese dialect of Mandarin continues to dominate use in the official language of the government, there is an emerging argument between those who insist that mandarin be standardised and used for cultural, official, and educational purposes. There are those who support the cultural protection of China's many languages. Proponents of radical language reform, especially among radical socialists, argue that the character system must be simplified to promote mass literacy across the country. However, they are opposed by more traditionalists within the Kuomintang. They argue that this extensive language simplification will strip characters and words of their original meaning and cultural sophistication.\n\nA compromise is reached, however, with the Ministry of Education first publishing a list of \"Guoyin Common Vocabulary\". which includes popular simplified characters and determines the standard phonetic system. Furthermore, it has also proposed the creation of a committee on the Unification of National Languages to organise simplified characters already in circulation as standard characters. However, this is far from radical character reform and does not seek to change many existing characters in the Chinese hanzi."

If China is to reassert her historical position as the leading power in Asia, then like Japan before her - she must take it upon herself to rapidly industrialise and modernise.\n\nLeading the discourse on National Reconstruction are none other than Central Committee members Chen Gongbo and Song Ziwen. Both Song and Chen see China as an economically colonised country, forced to let the foreign powers extract her raw materials and invade its market -  thus hindering China's own industrial development. Chen and Song are influenced by international developments in the Commune of France, the Union of Britain, and interestingly enough even the Russian Svobodniks, to conceptualise a concept of autarkic industrialisation, or the reorientation of the economy along lines of dirigisme and corporatism.\n\nThey plan for the development of a National Economic Council which shall seek to utilise central economic planning, development through centrally managed production teams, the mobilisation of agriculture in support of urban industrialisation, and a corporatist relationship between governments and private businesses (allocated by the state of course). By nationalising and monopolising foreign trade, Chen Gongbo has argued that the state would gain additional means to build capital. The ultimate goal of this state-capitalist model is to develop the Chinese economy while also preventing the new Chinese republic from sliding into bourgeois capitalism. Certainly, there may be some capitalists who would grow rich in the process of harnessing private capital but according to Chen Gongbo, they would not develop sufficient strength to subvert the economic system of the Party-State."

 CHI.lategame.005.d: "With the unification of China proper under the sword and flag of the Kuomintang, efforts have been made to consolidate Nationalist rule with a proper Chinese anthem. The previous anthem of the Beiyang Republic \"Song to the Auspicious Cloud\" and other anthems have been denounced as being backwards and or irrelevant to the modern Chinese revolutionary struggle. Furthermore, the National Anthem Commission has been assigned to create a patriotic song to rally the millions of people that make up the Chinese nation - in order to bolster nationalism as part of the party's pursuit of \"Minzu\".\n\nWhile some radical socialists within the KMT and the League of Chinese Syndicalists have proposed the Internationale (translated in vernacular Chinese by the syndicalist Qu Qiubai), this move has attracted backlash from members of the Central Committee who believe that the lyrics of the National Anthem must reflect the principles held dear by our late premier Dr. Sun Yat-sen. As such, many are in favour of adopting Professor Cheng Maoyun's \"Three Principles of the People\" - which traces its lyrics to a speech Sun Yat-sen gave in 1924. Alternatively, a suggestion has arisen from the Chinese musician Huang Tzu - with lyrics taken from a poem written by the prominent right-wing Kuomintang ideologue Dai Jitao. While not as popular as the other two options, the song has also been suggested to be played at the raising and lowering of the national flag."

From the League War to the capture of Beijing, many revolutionary comrades had fallen along the way - and the fight is far from over. As long as imperialism remains in China, China cannot call herself free - the time has come for the KMT to take up its natural destiny as the true revolutionary vanguard to lead the Chinese people into a new era of respect and prestige.\n\nThe conclusion of the Second Congress have nonetheless raised some growing intensifying debates between members of the Provisional Action Committee and the Reorganised Comrades Association. The shaky united front between the Party's major factions as well as the other minor outlying factions of the national revolution is starting to unravel as there is no longer such a dominant call for unity. Growing criticism has been levelled towards Wang, who many in the PAC worry will simply seek to promulgate tutelage or merely hand over power nepotistically to his friends and family. Chen Gongbo has not been unrelenting at all in his insults at Deng Yanda, with Chen likening Deng and his military circles to a Bonapartist, and arguing that the PAC will not bring about democracy but rather years of military rule. All the while, what was once mere hushes has grown significantly in some extremist circles of the NRA - talks of radicalism brewing if the Party's leadership cannot resolve itself.\n\nStill, there is much to be done before the Kuomintang can truly settle down.

Few have been as honest or influential as Xu Qian, a founding father of our Republic's judicial system. Born in Nanchang, he successfully passed the imperial examination and went to work for the Ministry of Justice in 1907. He was a member of the Tongmenghui when he became Deputy of Minister of Justice under Tang Shaoyi's cabinet, but resigned in protest in face of Yuan Shikai's power grab. Since then, he held a variety of posts in the Kuomintang, including a seat on the Central Executive Committee.\n\nThe loss of such a prominent Old Guard member is a great tragedy for the party, even if he was lucky to have passed from old age, and have lived long enough to see our liberation of Beijing. And yet, already, the power jockeying has begun. As compensation for his loss of his CEC seat, Wang Jingwei gave him the post of Minister of Justice in the revolutionary government. Xu leaned towards the PAC, and the usual complaints about balance of power have streamed in from the same suspects. Wang has little patience for another round of theatrics, recalling the rumbling after Liao Zhongkai's death.\n\nCai Yuanpei, a former mentor of Wang and one of the esteemed \"Elders\" of the party has stepped up to the plate, offering to take on the position. An educator by training, there is a certain irony of an ex-anarchist becoming Minister of Justice, but perhaps that's part his appeal as a compromise between the RCA, PAC, and LCS.\n\nIn Wang's camp, Luo Junqiang has emerged as a leading candidate, upon the recommendation of Zhou Fohai. Luo is a former radical from the CSP, a former lieutenant colonel under Zhang Zhizhong, and has experience as a newspaper editor.\n\nAlthough in theory the Minister of Justice is nominated by the Premier of the Judicial Yuan, the CEC has met privately to decide on which candidate to \"suggest\" to the Premier."

 CHI.lategame.041.t: "The Chen Bijun Incident"
 CHI.lategame.041.d: "Chen Bijun or, as many derisively call her, Wang Furen (Madame Wang) is a power unto herself. While Wang dominates the political scene in Nanjing, she has established plenty of bases of her own to shore up her husband's position. As a testament to her power, at one point she is said to have informed a recently appointed mayor that \"The city is mine. You go there but do not control anyone. You just represent me to do things.\" This active lifestyle however has forced her to travel frequently, leaving her vulnerable to opponents.\n\nOr so they thought. With the help of some local (apparently ex-warlord) commanders, her entourage was ambushed at a parade she was supposed to attend. Under heavy guard, the kidnapping attempt was quickly foiled.\n\nThe government has begun its investigation and the finger-pointing has soon followed. Chen has publicly accused the army of orchestrating it, though her opponents have accused her of staging the whole event to gain sympathy and a pretext to arrest her enemies. Despite the clear evidence of wrongdoing, her allies have done damage to her case with their heavy-handed tactics in the immediate aftermath.\n\nWhat is undisputable however is how unsafe China is becoming, even in long \"liberated\" regions under Kuomintang rule. Violence against political figures has been normalised, and not everyone is as fortunate enough to have an armed caravan with them everywhere they go. Zhou Enlai has suggested pulling back, arguing revenge is best served cold. Wang, who has been enraged by the incident against his beloved wife, has turned to Li Shiqun for more proactive advice.\n\nLi, a former Red Squad member and now head of the Wang household security team, has instead suggested a harsher approach to root out subversives. Going house-to-house, he hopes to shake out suspects. Li influence within the Residence Faction is sure to increase after his successful protection of the First Lady."

 CHI.lategame.042.t: "Anarchism and the party-state"
 CHI.lategame.042.d: "In their ever continuing fight for control over the syndicalist movement in China, the Four Elders have sought to rope in anarchist thinkers and intellectuals into their movement. Former anarchists themselves and the primary patrons of the \"World Society\", they joined the Kuomintang in the 1920s - to the scorn of many \"true believers.\".\n\nWu Zhihui has vocally defended their decision the most. He has argued that the Kuomintang, World Society, and anarchists have a common enemy in warlordism and that like Kropotkin's support for the Great War, it is sometimes necessary for anarchists to support aligned causes. Moreover, with the Kuomintang's return to China, he has argued that the party has meaningfully changed since 1927, now truly committed to revolution and even should it fail - can always be brought back to the right path if enough anarchists join.\n\nNot everyone is convinced. Mao Yibo for example has accused the Kuomintang of being corrupt and serving the interests of militarists and job-seekers. Shen Zhongjiu, an anarcho-syndicalist from Zhejiang who had worked for the party briefly but has since grown estranged, has reiterated many of the concerns he expressed in 1924 in the \"Free People\" journal.\n\nTo him, the common-enemy argument could be used to justify any alliance and he denounced the idea that anarchists are like \"knight-errants\" of the classics, required to help everyone who asks. Instead, the modern anarchist must abide by their principles and keep in mind what happens next. He has further castigated the Four Elder's support of tutelage, democracy, and dictatorship of the proletariat - all of which retain government and private property. Hoping to follow such a path to anarchism, which has neither, would be \"no different than going south in order to go north\".\n\nStill, Shen and others have had some history of cooperating with the Kuomintang. But as the party has grown increasingly authoritarian, it will require far more than flowery discourse to truly sway hearts."

 CHI.lategame.043.t: "Wang Leping Murdered!"
 CHI.lategame.043.d: "A grisly murder has been reported in Nanjing today. While many have grown apathetic to the death and violence around them, even among prominent politicians, this one has stirred up considerable emotions. Wang Leping was a long-time socialist revolutionary from Wulian County in Shandong. A prolific writer, progressive, and activist, he often served as a contact point between Wang Jingwei's camp and other socialist factions.\n\nBy 1926, he was the first alternative Central Executive Committee member and also spent time working under Deng Yanda and Feng Yuxiang. Generally well-liked (or at least respected), he turned away from Chen Duxiu and Marxism. Instead he found his home in the Moderate wing of the Reorganised Comrades Association, co-writing the Advance newspaper with Gu Mengyu. Suspects continue to abound as people wonder the motivations of the crime.\n\nThe nature and brutality of crime generally points to Dai Chunfeng and his men, who have a considerable network of contacts in the Jiangnan region since his League of Ten days. The RCA have extended their accusations to the entire army, believing this to be the cumulation of a longer campaign of coercion against RCA-aligned politicians. PAC politicians have fired back, noting that Wang Leping was often on the verge of siding with them, and Zhou Enlai's Red Squad often can match the League in ruthless when it comes to silencing traitors.\n\nIt is unlikely the true culprits will ever be caught, and at best the police will catch a few low-life scapegoats. But as suspicions rise, it seems that one narrative will generally prevail, even if not everyone believes it."

 CHI.lategame.044.t: "The Church in Nationalist China"
 CHI.lategame.044.d: "\"Religion teaches men obedience, which is the moral code of slaves! Religion propagates superstitions which hinder the search for truth.\"\n\nThese are proclamations often found in Beijing, placed by a resurgent Great Federation of Anti-Religionists. The federation is a movement by many Chinese intellectuals, both directly part of the Kuomintang and outside of it. Anticlericalism in China often has multiple roots, the Christian church in particular is opposed by the intelligentsia for its perceived backwardness as well as its association with foreign imperialism. This mutual disdain has attracted socialist, anarchist, and nationalists together in this campaign, protesting for example the World's Student Christian Federation Conference scheduled to be held at Tsinghua University. At the movement's helm once included many luminaries such as Li Shizeng, Chen Duxiu, Cai Yuanpei, Li Dazhao and Wang Jingwei.\n\nNot everyone in the party has an antagonistic relationship with religion or even Christianity for that matter. The Song family patriarch Song Jiashu was a Methodist minister and raised all of his children in the faith. Dr. Sun Yat-sen and Sun Fo converted to the faith as well. Many others find themselves in more complicated situations, living between their Confucian-inspired upbringing and exposure to Christian preaching. Zhang Fakui and his wife for example have loosely affiliated with Roman Catholicism though have not converted.\n\nCautious in being embroiled in these touchy matters, both Wang Jingwei and Song Qingling have largely refrained from making any statement in public despite their respective pasts - offering only generic statements asking for peace and mutual respect. But often-times as the revolution's claims of social change hit a delicate nerve as China continues to change."

 CHI.lategame.045.t: "A Declaration..."
 CHI.lategame.045.d: "As the revolution drags on, the party faces a conundrum. The movement which, for all its divisions, was once concentrated while down on its last legs, has now grown to a critical point. As the [CHI.GetName] swallowed up much of China, more and more non-socialists have been absorbed to the ostensibly democratic party. Meanwhile, sensing victory and not wishing to water down the promises they have sacrificed so much for, plenty on the left have grown radicalised. Soon, many fear, the party will once again be back at one another's throats like in 1924.\n\nThis problem has taken shape in the clashing working papers being passed around the Legislative Yuan. The first has proposed that the central problem of China lies in the poverty of the peasantry, and that they are poor because of their lack of land. Therefore, it calls upon the newly established Ministry of Agriculture and Labour to implement the long-awaited land reform. Furthermore, the Kuomintang's ranks must also be drawn by the growing number of proletariat in the nation's industrialising cities. The party must therefore support unionisation and breaking both foreign and domestic chains. Fittingly, the draft has dedicated itself to the union of \"Peasants and Workers\".\n\nAnother, less popular draft, seeks to address the growing fears of division in the party-state. If the party represents the nation, then it cannot afford to fall back into a state of quasi-civil war like in at Canton. The paper calls for reconciliation, both with former Kuomintang rightists and with other democratic revolutionaries to build a new, representative China. While it also includes mentions of fulfilling social and economic promises, it also has called for moderation and the forgiveness of past transgressions.\n\nAt the end of the day, the drafts being showcased are just words from a relatively powerless legislature. But, with free expression often suppressed (whether de jure or de facto), often these halls are among the few places where free discussion is permitted. The Declaration that ultimately passes will demonstrate the strength of various caucuses."

 CHI.lategame.046.t: "Formation of the League of Civil Rights"
 CHI.lategame.046.d: "The Kuomintang revolution has sparked discourse on a freer China, but not always favourably; many intellectuals have noticed the dissonance between Kuomintang promises and the party-state's reality. Like flashes in the pan, most efforts to speak out have come to little Except perhaps one.\n\nInitially proposed by left-leaning foreign journalists living in Shanghai, the China League of Civil Rights was formed in 1932 as a means of gathering liberal support for the Shanghai uprising. This \"new line of action\" included creating a striking contrast between Zhili oppression and Kuomintang liberation.\n\nTheir manifesto included three tenants: to liberate political prisoners, to give legal assistance to political prisoners, and to assist in the struggle for civil rights including free organisation, speech, press and assembly. They have sought the attention of both liberals internationally and from the Beiyang establishment, though were not successful at freeing any prisoners.\n\nWang was unamused when Song Qingling, Cai Yuanpei, and Yang Xingfo submitted a very public telegram last month on behalf of the League to the CEC. The letter demanded the end of arbitrary arrests and was signed by dozens of prominent figures in the party, academia, and the press. Peril abounds and there is doubts on its longevity. Already Song and Cai have been sternly warned for stepping outside the party orthodoxy, and anonymous death threats have come in (though their high rank protects them from any real harm). Others however, not so much. Yang was gunned down in front of the Academia Sinica building yesterday afternoon, sending a chill through the League.\n\nThe League has also staggered due to infighting. New Culture figures like Hu Shih and Liu Yutang had been reluctant to sign on unless the League commits to only using legal channels. Prior rivalries within the LCS has made the CSP hesitant to join the World Society in endorsing the league. Many of the original members have gone to extremes, undermining Song and Cai's authority. Ultimately a rather elitist organisation, it has also struggled to gain much popular support."

 CHI.lategame.047.t: "Charity and Cunning in China"
 CHI.lategame.047.d: "If there's any silver lining to the mayhem and tragedy of war, it is when communities and nations grow closer together in solidarity. With so many lives uprooted thanks to war and revolution, often-times government initiatives are simply not enough to help the suffering. With the magistrates overwhelmed, there is often room for humble heroes to lend a helping hand.\n\nSong Qingling, the widow of Sun Yat-sen, has entered the national spotlight with her numerous charitable efforts. As President of the China Welfare Foundation (founded initially as the China Defence League), they have raised money from foreign aid and private donations to support a wide range of causes including refugee relief, medical supplies, and care for orphans. Led primary by the Song and Liao families, they owe their prominence in part due to their connections with the Central Executive Committee and also favourable press coverage by figures such as Edgar Snow.\n\nUnfortunately, although few would like to publicly admit it, charity is often also another weapon of war. The party has exploited in the past its concern for the poor as a propaganda tool against warlord governments. Even organisations ostensibly neutral often have party members strategically placed on their boards, including the Red Cross Society of China.\n\nPartisans affiliated with the Provisional Action Committee have taken the opportunity to cast Song (and to a lesser extent He Xiangning) as a marked contrast with First Lady Chen Bijun, as perhaps the two most prominent women in the nation. While both came from wealthy merchant families and are long-time revolutionaries, Chen has been depicted by PAC-aligned papers as a scheming and machiavellian shrew - obsessed more with power than helping the people. Wang has angerily demanded censors quickly remove such publications and Song has disavowed any such disunity, but the smear campaign is likely to create a lasting enmity between the factions."

 CHI.lategame.048.t: "The Shifting Underground"
 CHI.lategame.048.d: "\"Laws are useless when men are pure, unenforceable when men are corrupt.\"\n\nThe Kuomintang's involvement with the underground is a complex affair - but certainly not a static one. While nationalist gangs were a major help across the decades, providing republican causes both shelter and funding during their most dire times, they have also been a parasitic influence as the party rises again. Now that the party has successfully united the nation, their former allies have come forward to \"collect.\"\n\nIt is not always a simple thing to differentiate criminal gangs from revolutionary cells. They often share tactics such as extortion, secret-gathering, and violence during revolutionary times. Many mobsters are sincere in their republican outlook and have already been rewarded with local positions of power, posts that give them an air of legitimacy in their dealings. They burrow themselves into pillars of society, adapting to the post-revolutionary atmosphere. But the corruption, wheeling-and-dealing, and nepotism has undoubtedly have had a corrosive effect - sullying our image as a force for a more egalitarian future.\n\nOf course, there are some that are straight-up criminals or opportunists. Those have been the primary target of recent anti-crime initiatives. But there is a call now to curb misconduct, expelling these unsavoury elements with a broad brush. As our government expands and revolutionary enthusiasm has waned in favour of finding stability, many fear that the party-state's resistance to outside criticism leaves it vulnerable to institutionalised corruption and abuse. Defining the difference between a well-connected local power-holder and a nefarious mobster in a clean suit may very well make the difference in our nation's future."

 CHI.lategame.049.t: "The Cult of the Chairman"
 CHI.lategame.049.d: "Throughout history, particularly in times of great strife, people have often clung to the mythos of a strong-man: a powerful, visionary leader capable of protecting the common person and saving the nation. And in the new China being born, that leader might just be Wang Jingwei. Handsome, charismatic, and well-educated - Wang is a natural leader. He has been a revolutionary since before even Xinhai, risking his life in a daring assassination attempt against the Qing regent. A popular myth is that he was saved from execution because he caught the eye of a Manchu noblewoman.\n\nWang, as the party-machine cries, was the man who has led the party through thick and thin. Through the ignominious exile and then sweeping into national leadership. Wang is the heroic democrat who will fulfil the democratic promises of the Xinhai Revolution. Wang is the statesman capable of uniting the party's warring factions, healing rifts within the Kuomintang and also building bridges with the outside world. Wang is the revolutionary with the vision, the man who can truly build an egalitarian, free, and prosperous China. Wang is the man, the leader who will unite China, cast out imperialists and warlords, and end the humiliations.\n\nWang himself has sought to maintain a humble image in public. A portrait of Sun Yat-sen was hung over Tiananmen gate, looking over the square. Wang was sure to be there for the dedication speech, delivering an emotional address honouring the party's Eternal Premier. Sun Fo however has lashed back in whatever publications he could find willing to defy the Chairman's authority. Hoping to stop or at least stall Wang's efforts to incorporate himself into the broader Sun Yat-sen personality cult and mythos, he has written a series of publications leveraging his claimed status as the expert on his father's work. He argues that the late party founder's legacy was not Marxist and has been sure to include multiple snide remarks about Wang. His damning words were calculated to just barely skirt the line of the censors, and has already started a political firestorm."

 CHI.lategame.050.d: "Born to a prosperous Hunan family with ties to Jiangxi, Liu Shaoqi was fortunate enough to go abroad for his studies. Recruited by some predecesssors to the Chinese Syndicalist Party in 1920, his eyes were opened by his experiences in post-revolutionary France. He formally joined the newly formed CSP in 1921 and returned home in 1922 to help organise various labour strikes in the Jiangxi-Hunan area. He also met Li Lisan, becoming an increasing prominent member of the CSP and by extension the League of Chinese Syndicalists.\n\nThe Northern Expedition was a difficult time for both the Kuomintang and the League. Forced underground, he served as a minor political officer in the MinGan insurgency. Although considered an Orthodox member of the CSP, generally supporting the Chen Duxiu-Li Lisan Line, the connections he made in MinGan might prove pivotal in the LCS's attempts at expanding their movement beyond their urban proletariat base.\n\nLiu has been appointed the CSP Party Secretary of Fujian, hoping to win friends in the heart of the National Revolutionary Government's agrarian movement. A strong writer, he has published a series of articles, including one that extols the mass movement, arguing the revolution should strive for freedom of the masses, winning their great faith, and adopting completely democratic working methods and organisational methods. He has called for both party cadres and leaders to be disciplined and democratic, public in their organising as to ensure a democratic form of leadership. Moreover, he has also called for the implementation of land reform.\n\nMany are unimpressed, believing that these are just words. But the sincerity of his outreach has moved at least some, particularly those who feel the current PAC-dominated leadership in the region has grown too stagnant. The successes of the CSP in building greater rural ties perhaps is just as much a factor of how complacent the PAC has grown, and already cadres have expressed concern of brewing tensions."

 CHI.lategame.061.d: "It wasn't always like this. Years ago, when the Tongmenghui first took power at the end of the Xinhai Revolution, there was hope for a multi-partisan democratic republic. But even as they entered Beijing for negotiations, sinister machinations were already in play and the dream of a peaceful handover of power was dashed.\n\nIn its wake, the Kuomintang was formed by an aggrieved Dr. Sun. The party has made its share of alliances with warlords and republicans, notably the Constitutional Protection Movement, but ultimately it came to nought and Dr. Sun realised we were better off alone. The Chinese United Front with the League of Chinese Socialists was the sole exception to this, and the decision to reach out to Syndicalist powers splintered the party into factions - yet another painful memory for the weary movement. Yet in the end, it was this alliance that now stands triumphant in Beijing.\n\nThe question today is what to do with the others: the dozens of other factions who collaborated with the corrupt Beiyang system. Many centrist factions have reached out in hopes of having a place in our new government. These politicians have a variety of motivations, some due to patriotism, some due to aligned goals, and others due to naked opportunism.\n\nAlthough the Kuomintang professes the need for a one-party state during the tutelage, this does not need to be so literally interpreted as the LCS can attest. Alternatives include allowing individual politicians to run as Dangwai (literally \"Outside of Party\" or \"Party Outsider\"). For this scheme to work, a reasonable number of seats must be set aside for these independents, though obviously not enough to challenge Kuomintang rule. Another option is to simply absorb certain elements into the party directly, after all there are plenty of people who once swore allegiance to the broad-tent Tongmenghui.\n\nBe warned however, not everyone will be happy if we debase our party, even if it advances our ultimate goal of democracy. But it will send a message across the land that we not a gaggle of socialist radicals, but a reasonable movement worthy of Dr. Sun's legacy."

 CHI.lategame.062.d: "Federalism, in its current state, has been largely discredited within Kuomintang circles. This was because of its affiliation with Chen Jiongming, a Guangdong general who broke with Dr. Sun in 1922 after a bitter series of mutual escalations. Many members of the party felt personally attacked (in many cases, quite literally) by this betrayal, and the ensuing bad blood has poisoned ties between southern republican groups.\n\nBut federalism as a concept has its predecessors in the party. Li Shizeng for example argued that federalism a continuation of Proudhonist \"Principle of Federation\", a necessary step in the eventual implementation of anarchism in China. To him and others in the World Society, a proper form of federalism would require sharing between central and local units. This cooperation would exist between villages, districts, provinces, regional councils and up to the central government, something he referred to as \"fenzhi hezuo\" and identified with French concepts of regionalisme and federalisme. Eventually, the hope is that a world-wide federation would be established and power devolved slowly downwards until the state is abolished.\n\nThis line of thinking has been criticised not only by the Marxist-inspired factions in the party, but also many of the nationalist factions. In a notable turnabout in the early 1920s, the term \"self-government\" was phased out of Kuomintang propaganda in favour of \"local administration\". To the Kuomintang, self-government became less associated with democracy and more associated with a continuation of warlordism - a fact not helped by Chen Jiongming's decision to accept Wu Peifu's rule.\n\nNonetheless, throwing a bone out there for the Federalist remnants in the country would help smoothen unification. But these short term compromises can only hold together for so long. But could they possibly be long enough?"

 CHI.lategame.063.d: "One of the touchiest subjects of the day in [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], yet perhaps the most ubiquitous compromise within the party-state is the rehabilitation of many \"rightists\" in the party. Or at least claiming to be members of the party. The practical distinction between the old Kuomintang's left, right, centre, and military factions were always much more blurred than at the top. While figures such as Wang Jingwei, Liao Zhongkai, Hu Hanmin, Sun Fo, Dai Jitao, and Chiang Kai-shek quarrelled over the Sun Yat-sen's legacy, for most rank-and-file members the party represented one unified revolutionary movement.\n\n\"Leftists\" and \"rightists\" often went to class together at Whampoa, fought side by side in the trenches, and often were killed together by reactionaries. It is no surprise that even after all these years and the acrimony growing quite bitter, including mutual slander, assassinations, and even outright warfare, plenty of lower ranking officers have helped their old friends find a place in our new government.\n\nFor the better informed members of the party that sit in the CEC, the reality is drastically different. Most \"right\" Kuomintang factions are warlords by this point, a facsimile of revolutionary spirit at best and a mockery of our efforts at worst. The CEC looks down on reconciliation, viewing them as too far gone. Allowing these party-apostates into our ranks is a recipe for treason, deception, or worse corruption - and this sort of subversion is dangerous in these times.\n\nIt is very difficult to actually legislate any official ban or even regulate it.

It is a ready source of profit, despite the human costs involved, and plenty of other narcotics have flown into the nation in the meanwhile. Bureaus, agencies and non-governmental reformers have all tried with no avail, though with our recent consolidation of control there is hope for genuine change this time.\n\nTo stop it, a series of wide-reaching proposals have been presented by various legal, medical, and social experts. These include various rehabilitation policies, harsh arrests and punishments of dealers, and aggressive targetting of opium-producing regions for destruction/replanting. On the flip-side however, it is possible that a government run monopoly on these \"special goods\" might be what is actually needed at the moment for the revolutionary government to survive.

 CHI.lategame.065.d: "When he was deposed as a child in 1912 and put into de facto house arrest in the Forbidden City, few thought Puyi would ever be a threat. After all, the monarchy was deeply unpopular and the fledging Republic had far more pressing problems to deal with than a hapless toddler. But alas, strongmen came and went starting with Yuan Shikai, and many ignorantly attempted to hoist a monarchy onto the people. The Germans, in all their arrogance, insisted on restoring Puyi to his so-called \"birthright\", as if the snuffing out of the Xinhai dream could be any more complete.\n\nBut the republican dream of freedom did not die with the end of the Northern Expedition. And now, with our Republic at last restored across China, this leaves one final matter to attend to as we turn the page in China's story. Puyi has grown into a vile, wicked man - taught little practical skills and a sadistic, childish personality. Or so our propaganda says. The reality is the man has been a puppet his entire life, and [CHI.GetLeader] has already ruled out a public execution of the deposed Emperor as excessive. There is little for our government to gain besides unneeded comparisons to Lenin. So there remain a few options.\n\nThe first would be to simply exile him to whichever state is willing to take him in. While this would effectively wash our government's hands of this matter, some question if this would pose a major security risk. Another possibility is to order him confined in the Forbidden City under house arrest, keeping him out of sight until he dies forgotten. Many however feel this is too similar to the unpopular articles written after Puyi's first abdication, and also allows for the effective embodiment of reactionary evil to go unpunished for his treasonous deeds. The final, and perhaps most radical proposal, would be to attempt to rehabilitate Puyi.

If one arrives at the palace museum garden early in the afternoon, they might run into a rather scrawny and plain-clothed-dressed gardener tending to the flowers, who is more than eager to point out and lecture on the Palace's treasures as well as things he had used in his youth. Spectators and tourists are beyond astonished when they realise that the old gardener is none other than the former Xuantong emperor - Puyi, himself.\n\nFollowing his capture by NRA forces during the completing stages of the Second Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang decided to remodel him into a model citizen in tune with the ideals of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The former emperor and captured Fengtian and Japanese soldiers were sent to a prisoner-of-war camp during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Here, the former emperor was observed as unable to perform even basic tasks such as brushing his teeth and tying his shoes, much to the amusement of his captors. During his \"re-education,\" Puyi met with those who had suffered due to famine and economic failure in both the former League of Eight Provinces and Zhili Province - as a testament to the consequences of his collaborations with the Germans.\n\nAfter several long years in re-education, the Party's Central Committee officially voted to suspend Puyi's sentence and release him as a productive member of the New China. He has recently gotten remarried to a hospital nurse named Li Shuxian and, with the encouragement of the Party, hopes to complete his autobiography. These days, he denounces imperialism, claims he was a coward, and betrayed his country by working with the Germans. A very clumsy man who has had his needs taken care of his whole life, he reportedly now finds much more happiness than when he was the Emperor of China and is known by some locals as a rather kind and humble man. As he says himself \"Yesterday's Puyi is the enemy of today's Puyi.\""

 CHI.lategame.067.t: "Developing our Rule in Mongolia"
 CHI.lategame.067.d: "After the National Revolutionary Army swept into Urga and drove out all before them, the joys of victory were soon replaced by the difficult reality of governing such a wide, sparsely populated land. Mongolia has few permanent settlements and remains deeply poor and agrarian. Despite claims of national unification and equality among the five races, many Mongolians have grown accustomed to independence and are deeply suspicious of Chinese nationalism.\n\nSerengdongrub (Bai Yunti in Chinese), a longtime Kuomintang member and RCA affiliate, has been installed Chairman of Mongolia. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has ostensibly been preparing ethnic minorities in the party for tutelage in their home regions, however their ranks remain very thin. Serengdongrub's Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party only had limited traction in inner Mongolia to the south.\n\nWith preexisting Kuomintang membership so limited, staffing for the new government has been supplemented by members of existing socialist and leftist groups in Mongolia, most notably the Mongol Ardin Nam (Mongolian People's Party) based primarily in western Mongolia. Their leaders have insisted on considerable concessions from the Han-dominated central government, though they often bicker and jockey among themselves for power.\n\nThe alternatives are not particularly savoury either. While most Russian-backed warlords have fled, the former Mongolian nobility and other conservative interests led by Unenbayan and Prince Demchugdongrub remain active. The more moderate elements in Urga such as Unenbayan have expressed openness to joining the Kuomintang, likely in hopes of continuing their entrenched influence over the area.\n\nThere is some doubt about whether or not these discussions ultimately matter for the common folk, especially as resistance is expected to continue. General Ulanhu, one of the highest ranking ethnic Mongolian military officers in the NRA, has been charged with maintaining order. Supposedly desk-mates with Chiang Ching-kuo while studying in the Internationale and having ties to military intelligence, some wonder about his loyalties. His family is said to have been already amassing considerable power among the locals."

 CHI.lategame.068.d: "The conquest of Lhasa by the National Revolutionary army has placed the world's largest and most elevated plateau under the control of the Republic of China, though already trouble abounds in the new Tibetan administration. Having enjoyed de facto independence from China for decades now and having fought multiple wars to maintain it, many Tibetans are suspicious of the ambitions of the Chinese nationalism.\n\nWith the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission having been largely unsuccessful in creating a large cadre of Kuomintang members of ethnic Tibetan heritage, the party has turned to the allied Tibet Improvement Party formed in India with some help by exiled Kuomintang officers. The pro-Chinese 9th Panchen Lama (born Thubten Choekyi Nyima) has been installed as Chairman, though with plenty of Chinese \"advisors\" looking over his shoulder.\n\nThis has attracted complaints that the bureaucrats the Kuomintang have deployed have proven actively detrimental to creating a lasting, harmonious rule in the highlands. Many side-step the Chairman, reporting directly back to [CHI.capital.getcapitalvictorypointname] for orders. Tibetan Improvement Party leaders such as Pandatsang Rapga and Gendun Chophel have pleaded [CHI.GetLeader] and the Central Executive Committee for a freer hand, arguing that the TIP have long been loyal supporters of Dr. Sun's Three Principles and modernisation.\n\nWhether or not that is true is debatable, however in their efforts to overthrow reactionary rule it seems they have allied with \"democratic\" groups of various stripes under the promise of elections. These groups demand provisional elections during tutelage, adding to the instability gripping the region.\n\nIn wake of the growing power vacuum, more and more decisions have fallen upon General Huang Musong, the General-Advisor of Tibet sent west by Kuomintang many years ago as the provisional head of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. He has advised the creation of the Tibet Improvement Militia and has been given control of NRA forces in the region, the climax of decades of service."

 CHI.lategame.069.d: "The National Revolutionary Army's march into Dihua has seen the Republic of China become the latest Han government to attempt to extend their authority into the west. Covering a massive area, including much of the Taklamakan Desert, Xinjiang has seen considerable instability as Han authority crumbled. Resistance continues by local reactionaries and disgrunted nationalists, and Kuomintang control is strained by the long travel distance; some say it takes longer for a man in Singapore to return to Berlin than for one in Beijing to go to Dihua.\n\nForced to give some degree of autonomy to the local government, [CHI.GetLeader] has turned to Burhan Shahidi as their regional Chairman. An Uygur political figure fluent in multiple languages, he is also a graduate of Baoding military academy. Having translated Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles into Uyghur, he and his Tatar wife Rashida are said to be sympathetic to the Kuomintang.\n\nShort on reliable allies, the Kuomintang have been forced to cobble together an administration. Aksu has been home to many disaffected members of Yang Zengxin's old Xinjiang clique, including Sheng Shicai. The Han general has sought to enter our good graces, touting his \"Marxist\" credentials and past in the NRA and Guominjun. Pardoned of any prior crimes by the desperate Republic, he has been charged with reorganising the local security forces of the old regime, a decision we have had little time to regret.\n\nA showdown is looming between General Sheng and Chairman Shahidi, with [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] too distant and ignorant of the situation on the ground to stop them. Tao Zhiyue, one of General Zhang Zhizhong's close friends, has been appointed the provincial military governor though he complains that his authority is limited to only a few divisions in Dihua. He has begged for reinforcements, claiming otherwise he will be helpless to stop the situation from further deteriorating.\n\nWith the quagmire only growing, some wonder if we should \"wash our hands of the situation\", negotiating with local guerilla bands and leaving the region largely autonomous. This will likely doom Xinjiang's socialist future to the mercy of power-hungry men, but will at least allow Xinjiang to remain in Chinese hands at a minimal cost."

 CHI.lategame.070.t: "The Taiwan Dilemma"
 CHI.lategame.070.d: "After decades of foreign rule, the National Revolutionary Army triumphantly arrived in Taipei, returning the island to Chinese control. Taiwan, sometimes referred to as Formosa, was seized by Japan during the first Sino-Japanese war and subject to colonisation - something that will take time to reverse. Still, the arrival of Chinese forces was greeted with significant fanfare by the locals and the party has thrown considerable weight into integrating the region.\n\nLocated just a few hundred kilometers from Fujian, interactions between anti-Japanese resistance fighters in Taiwan and the MinGan insurgency were relatively common. Dr. Jiang Weishui, a physician and a founder of the broad-tent Taiwanese Cultural Association (TCA), formed the Taiwanese People's Party (TPP) with inspiration from the Kuomintang. Dubbed by some as the island's Sun Yat-sen, he organised various leftist protests against Japanese rule and has since been rewarded with the Chairmanship by [CHI.GetLeader]. He and the TPP have generally received support from former MinGan officials, though their authoritarian style of management has made enemies.\n\nWith the TPP folding into the Kuomintang, Jiang's new administration has been dogged by lingering tensions within the Taiwanese resistance movement. Xie Xuehong, Jian Ji, and the radical left-wing of the TCA formed the Taiwanese Syndicalist Party after an acrimonious split. Bucking from Jiang's rule, they have appealed to [CHI.capital.getcapitalvictorypointname] and the League of Chinese Syndicalists, asking them to force Jiang to honour the terms of the original United Front.\n\nSuch an intervention would undermine the Chairman's rule, though some in the Central Executive Committee have proposed we go further and encourage Jiang to form a wider coalition with centre-right elements on the island. Healing the rifts between the TPP and their former allies in the TCA will not be easy, but may help with the integration process and protect the international legitimacy of China's claim to the region.\n\nThe ongoing difficulties of administering the island has made some wonder if Jiang is up for the task. Some have suggested local decision-making be curtailed for the time being and critical decisions be forwarded to [CHI.capital.getcapitalvictorypointname] for review."

Thousands if not millions have died since the start of the warlord era, families have been divided and countless displaced from their homes. Yet in the end the Kuomintang has emerged the sole victor, destroying or outlasting the half dozen or so other factions that once dared vie for national leadership. The party of Sun Yat-sen is all that remains now, proof they claim of their revolution's moral superiority.\n\nThe truth, as always it seems, is murkier. The party had banded fiercely together against foreign invaders and domestic foes, united by nationalism and revolutionary promises. But even at the height of their accomplishments, there were cracks in this United Front, and with external threats receding the party is as divided as ever.\n\nThe people too have grown tied of the arbitrariness of de facto military rule, with an inconsistent application of civilian political tutelage and military governance across the nation. Surely, the masses are grateful of unification and celebrate the imperialists slinking back to their homelands, but they have also made clear their unwillingness to bear further sacrifice without a clear vision for the future.\n\nMatters are coming to a head, and observers are on the lookout for further instability in future political developments. As the party-state works to clean up scattered resistance, a growing chorus of voices have demanded another special national congress held by the Kuomintang, this time with full representation from across the realm."

Formally known as the \"Third Repatriated National Congress of the Kuomintang\", despite its name it is expected that members of the League of Chinese Syndicalists and other aligned republicans will attend.\n\nAn itinerary has already been prepared with a list of topics to be discussed, though the elephant in the room is the fate of Wang Jingwei himself. The long-time Party Chairman and President of the Republic has cast a controversial shadow, despite his efforts to portray himself as a compromising figure. Many see him as a dictator in the making, increasingly untethered from the collective leadership of the CEC.\n\nHis list of enemies has grown as he and his allies have worked to consolidate power. Chief among these enemies is the Provisional Action Committee, an intra-party faction led by Song Qingling. She has worked to assemble Wang's rivals into a workable coalition. While much of the military is known to prefer to see Wang gone, few are willing to endorse an outright coup.\n\nInstead it appears both factions are entering the Third Congress with their knives sharpened. Only a select few know the full extent of either side's plan, but it is certain they will seek to assert dominance in the proceedings. The Third Congress will be the largest party congress yet, with over a thousand representatives hastily drawn from every province and county.

 CHI.lategame.202.d: "The torches shone bright as the procession marched, just after dusk. In the town of Hankou, one of the three that make up Wuhan, sat the German concession, established in 1895 in exchange for German support against Japan. The inland concessions in China are a remnant of the terrible international mandate system that has plagued China, and a constant reminder of the century of humiliation.\n\nFacing the advance of the Kuomintang, most foreigners fled, leaving the concession effectively abandoned. Yet, due to fears of international condemnation, the cities were untouched during the second Northern Expedition. The Nationalist Government decided to respect their sovereignty for the time being, electing to wait for a better time for negotiations.\n\nFor many soldiers and students however, even this was too much. With the Japanese driven out of China in a deadly war, the nation has seen an upswing in nationalism. Tapping into this energy is the China Revival Society, an ultranationalistic band of officers who have denounced the concession of Hankou as void in the context of the Kuomintang's anti-imperialist policies.\n\nSpurred on by He Zhonghan, a large detachment of CRS officers marched into the concession areas in the city, targetting the German concession in particular as revenge for their role in the first Northern Expedition. Initially a disciplined formation, they were soon joined in by mobs of locals who proceeded to break windows and burn down foreign buildings in a riot. But perhaps even more startling to the press was the image of European flags being torn down and burned, and replaced with the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth."

Many are horrified by the mob violence, while plenty other groups are jealous of the attention the CRS received - believing them to be taking undue credit for the entire party's anti-imperial efforts. Whatever the case, Wang has remained strategically silent as the country braces for imitators.\n\nOver the last few days, China has fallen to another wave of instability as riots have broken out throughout major Chinese cities, especially near the ports. Disturbing reports of anti-concessionist violence have filled the airwaves and overwhelmed the police, worsened by the wide-spread participation of security forces. Even areas still outside of Kuomintang control are expected to see instability.\n\nAs the mob violence spreads, they have begun to break down across factional lines. Socialist mobs have extended the campaign against capitalist oppressors, terrorising bourgeois neighbourhoods and commerical districts. Nationalist groups have cast even our MMIC advisors as foreign imperialists, taking a strident anti-European and anti-foreign tone. Many, particularly the CRS, accuse the LCS of being puppets of foreign control.\n\nWith the situation spiralling out of control, the military has finally been deployed to restore order. With curfews declared and more disciplined units sent in, the chaos has been brought to a close. But not before an MMIC officer was found dead."

 CHI.lategame.204.d: "In the aftermath of several days of rioting, there have been numerous casualties, but none as damaging as an advisor of the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine. Although most of the MMIC officers escaped unharmed, their headquarters was raided and ransacked during the unrest, apparently abandoned by Chinese security forces at the height of the violence. Three were wounded in the evacuation, one was killed.\n\nThe untimely fallen was one Jean Fontenoy, head of the training department. A decorated officer during the Great War and French revolution, he was sent to China as part of the original mission. A writer, playboy and opium addict, it was said he was considered at one point for head of the mission but was passed over due to his growing addiction and sympathies for the Sorelian movement. This attribute and his hands-on approach seems to have won over some members of the CRS, who came to pay their last respects before his body is sent home.\n\nAndré Malraux, the head of the mission, is outraged at the death of his former rival and has lashed out against what he believes to be a deliberate attempt against the lives of his men. In an angry meeting with the Central Executive Committee he has accused what he described as an \"India Clique\" of rightist officers of leading a conspiracy against the government, hoping to hijack the revolution on the cusp of their revolutionary victory. He has pointed his finger at Generals Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue, the leaders of the old Chinese advisory group to Calcutta, as the centre of this nefarious cabal. He has gone so far as to claim he has eye-witnesses willing to testify of the two personally leading the mob.\n\nReconstruction Faction aligned CEC members including Sun Fo have immediately rose to Zhang's defence, angrily condemning what they claim are unsubstantiated rumour-mongering. But it is clear that the liberal faction of the party is under pressure, and it is likely many PAC-affiliated officers will go down with them. As Malraux is escorted from the meeting, the CEC has broken out into a heated discussion."

 CHI.lategame.205.d: "As if things could not get much worse, a series of documents now-dubbed the [GetMonth] Instructions have made the front page news in major cities. The \"leakers\", who have chosen to remain anonymous, claim they were taken from leading MMIC Advisor M.N. Roy's office. In them include a series of telegrams apparently from Paris which contain a series of demands to be delivered to Wang Jingwei at an appropriate opportunity, ostensibly to help him consolidate power and maintain the Internationale's support:\n\n1.) The All-China Federation of Labour (affiliated with the CSP) is to be legalised, and all Chinese unions placed under it.\n2.) An influx of syndicalists must be recruited into the army, and syndicalist-aligned officers promoted. Officers too \"Old Guard\" must be retired, forcibly if necessary.\n3.) Likewise, the party must be cleanse of those with \"Old Mindsets\", replaced with younger socialists trained abroad.\n4.) Revolutionary military courts must be established to punish reactionaries.\n\nThe original \"leak\" has been tracked down to newspapers connected with the CRS, particularly Qian Tu (lit. \"Future\", \"Prospects\"), but has quickly been picked up by PAC and RF affiliated papers. Widely distributed within just a day or so, the contents effectively imply the MMIC hopes to sponsor a CSP coup d'etat.\n\nThe timing is incredibly suspicious, and the contents have denounced as a forgery by Roy. Roy notes that he has been with the revolution since the beginning, and his close ties with both factions of the party. But with the MMIC on the defensive, Li Jishen has taken advantage of the moment to break his silence since the Nanjing incident. In a thundering speech, he has demanded the Internationale's military mission promptly expelled, claiming they wish to take advantage of their comrade's death to initiate a powergrab.\n\nHe has produced a long list of officers who have threatened to resign in protest if the \"prejudiced\" investigation into the alleged \"India Clique\" proceeds, with his name at the top of the list. Conversely however, if the MMIC is expelled, it is expected many of the thousands of officers they had trained will resign in solidarity."

Chairman [CHI.GetLeader] once more took to the stand under a grandiose portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the flags of the Party draped along its sides. What was different, however, was a newly commissioned portrait of the Chairman that was placed strategically to the right of the eternal premier - a move that was marked with looks of scorn and anger by members of the PAC.\n\nWang began his speech by thanking the Party for following true to the principles of Dr. Sun and for the martyrs who had sacrificed their lives during the War of Resistance. While the revolution's phase of military rule is hereby concluded with the NRA's recent victory over the Japanese, the revolution's Party rule must continue as Wang warned of reactionaries within the ranks of the Party who threaten to destablise it. Nonetheless, a party reshuffle is bound to happen with the election of a new Central Executive Committee and Chairman anticipated to happen.\n\nWhile he has long remained apolitical from the quarrels of the RCA and the PAC, he concluded in his opening remarks that he believed a new reorganisation of the Party is needed to emulate the same changes to the party in 1924. He denounced the conservatives within the India Clique and the Reconstruction Faction as \"degenerate forces\" stifling the spirit of the Reorganisation. This spirit had won the Second Northern Expedition. Wang concluded his remarks with a firm acknowledgment that while the United Front policy with the Chinese syndicalists was not an aspect of the First Reorganisation, it was a grave mistake if denunciation of the policy should lead to the rejection of the Spirit of the Reorganisation.\n\nWhile scores of cheers rang out from the delegates of the RCA and members of the CSP, only polite applause was heard from the PAC's section of the Congress while members of the World Society and the Reconstruction Faction stayed silent."

The Reconstruction Faction, in their unofficial caucus meetings, have acted as lively as ever - freshly energised by the fact that civilian rule is right around corner. In their minds, the end of war means the end of military dominance in priorities, giving the primarily civilian-based RF a leg up over both the PAC and RCA.\n\nSun Fo has sought to reinvent himself and his clique as through and through liberals, proponents of constitutionalism, anti-corruption, and the immediate end of tutelage. Casting himself as a democratic hero, he has denounced the one-party state as incompatible with his father's ideals, and with the final unification of China he claims it is time for a change.

He has openly begun calling the Chairman a dictator to the press, challenging him to commit to immediate, free, and fair elections nation-wide if he isn't.

However, a conviction requires a vote by the entire Congress, and that remains up in the air.

Agents of the Chairman and his opposition have played a tug of war for support, relying on all sorts of unscrupulous tactics to win.\n\nOne of most valuable prizes has been the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation.

 CHI.lategame.250.t: "Wang Carries the Day!"
 CHI.lategame.250.d: "Standing up to his feet, Wang quickly denied the allegations directed towards him. He declared brazenly and boldly that he was merely following the late Leader's instructions. Was it not integral to the concept of a Reorganised Party that it was the duty of the Party to instruct the Three Principles of the People? The Three Principles that, through their propagation, serve as the only means to save the nation? How can any true Kuomintang member say that party members should not strive for the fulfillment of this doctrine? If Dr. Sun's teachings are to be carried out, the Party as a living organ must indeed be reorganised so that a common goal, organisation, and discipline can be strengthened!\n\nWith his mesmeric hand gestures and his dramatic pauses, he concluded his speech with a thunderous applause. The Provisional Action Committee found itself stunned and humiliated. In a dramatic roll-call vote, the Congress voted not to convict and Wang was soon voted in for another term as Chairman of the Party. At a brisk pace, Wang sought his revenge - rapidly reshuffling government posts and naming a new CEC filled with RCA and Residence Faction loyalists.\n\nWith the majority of the Congress remaining loyal to the RCA, members of PAC and political rivals of the RCA such as the Reconstruction Faction have left the capital for the city of Wuhan, where General Deng Yanda has proclaimed a rebellion to \"save the National Revolution.\" As officers in the NRA begin taking sides, the China Revival Society has remained silent regarding the dramatic developments, but one can never expect silence from Hu and his shadowy cadre of followers.\n\nWuhan has been declared a free city and forces opposed to the Wang Jingwei regime are expected to converge there, make their stand 550km from the capital. It is clear that if Wang is to hold on to his recent conquest of the Congress, he must act deal with the Wuhan Government quickly."

The military ordered a full assault on the city of Wuhan equipped with heavy artillery and light bombers; nothing short of unconditional surrender was to be demanded from the rebel factions.\n\nAt dawn the city of Wuhan became yet another battleground with ongoing artillery shelling and gunfire from both sides as loyalist forces stormed the city. However, it was clear that the military advantage of the Nanjing Government was too much to bear for the PAC militias, who immediately began plans to evacuate to their heartland and base of popular support, the province of Fujian.\n\nSong Qingling's face was full of tears as she saw the slain and wounded comrades that had fought with her since the Fujian Insurgency. Unwilling to throw more lives away in the revolutionary struggle, she sent word at once to Wang's government - to negotiate the surrender of all PAC and anti-Wang forces. Despite the chagrin of her closest friend and ally, General Deng Yanda, who still believed that PAC forces could rally and fight back - Song Qingling, Song Ziwen, and other civilian leaders within the PAC have offered their full surrender to Wang and the Nanjing Government. The Party's fighting and war seems to have ended... for now."

 CHI.lategame.261.t: "The Awkward Peace"
 CHI.lategame.261.d: "An awkward sense of peace has returned to [CHI.GetNameDef] with the Provisional Action Committee thoroughly disintigerated as a political organisation. Under the instruction of the NRA, PAC's militias were to be disbanded and the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association prohibited as a formal organisation. Ever pragmatic and playing the role of the humble Chairman, Chairman Wang Jingwei has officially announced amnesty for all those who fought against him - citing that now was a time of healing not war.\n\nThe press of the Reorganised Comrades Association has meanwhile been busy printing out publications discarding the movement - headlines screaming Deng Yanda and Song Qingling's rumoured romantic relationship have been common along with other accusations of PAC corruption and voter intimidation. It has been reported that Wang has ordered all publications slandering the widow of the eternal premier to cease, but nonetheless such accusations have certainly earned the anger of the ever headstrong Deng.\n\nPerhaps thinking the amnesty rule and his own position in the Kuomintang protects him, Deng has in recent days criticised the new government's leadership - citing that they are no different than the reactionaries whom they fought in the Second Northern Expedition. There are whispers... whispers in the dark that unless Deng does not cease his protests, the Chairman may be inclined to act."
 CHI.lategame.261.a: "Can he just be silent?"
 CHI.lategame.262.t: "Reassuring Our Partners"
 CHI.lategame.262.d: "Chairman Wang has dispatched his trusted friend and comrade Chen Gongbo to discuss with the the Chinese syndicalists on establishing a renewed united front to secure greater internationale support. While Chen is firmly aligned with the ideals of the Nationalist Party and of the Reorganised Comrades Association, he was once a powerful labourer organiser within the Chinese Syndicalist Party - and many within the CSP radicals have read his works and acknowledge him as a prominent socialist in his own right. As the League of Chinese Syndicalists splits into factional conflict, Chen has approached the Chinese Syndicalist Party itself and has found agreement with both the Orthodox and Radical factions whom have acknowledged Wang's leadership of the Party.\n\nIn the meantime, the Chairman has been busy at work undertaking the party reorganisation. Only those who are members of the RCA and whom have pledged loyalty to the RCA and Wang have been allowed to receive membership within the Legislative Yuan. A new reorganisation is underway and the RCA's vision for a fully unified party grows stronger day after day..."

 CHI.lategame.263.t: "The Prodigal Son"
 CHI.lategame.263.d: "As the PAC-led opposition to Wang fizzles out, a sense of normalcy has returned to the Legislative Yuan. Most members of the Reconstruction Faction have been allowed to return to their seats without hassle, though how long this liberal fifth-column will be tolerated is an open question. As a preliminary measure, they have been put under extensive surveillance for any further subversion and caucus meetings have been openly monitored.\n\nWith any potential military muscle to their ideas evaporated with the collapse of the Wuhan rebellion, the best they can do is meekly mew about constitutional principles. If this is the route we would prefer, a \"gentle\" hand of intimidation and blackmail should be sufficient to keep them contained. For the \"Crown Prince\" himself a few embarrassing secrets have already been dug up, including his long-time illict affair with his former secretary Yan Aijuan, with whom he has fathered a daughter with. Sun Fo it seems has fallen behind on his hush-money payments, bankrupted by his political efforts. This and another affair would make be an unfortunate source of embarrassment should it be leaked to the press, something Sun has been made well aware of.\n\nNot everyone in the old Reconstruction Faction wishes to serve as a pliant, controlled-opposition. Many members of the bourgeoisie, who believed Sun Fo could live up to his promise to prevent a full socialist takeover of the party, have taken what assets they could and fled abroad like the traitors they are. With the power now in Wang's hands, perhaps they have already played the role we needed, and would be better served overseas. Sending Sun to America as Ambassador, or to tour Southeast Asia as head of the Overseas Chinese Commission or even back to Honolulu as head of some cultural organisation - it matters little. As long as he's out of the picture, we have little to fear."
 CHI.lategame.263.a: "Fear will keep them in line."
 CHI.lategame.263.b: "We have no use for them anymore."
 CHI.lategame.264.t: "The Final Warning"
 CHI.lategame.264.d: "Deng has been relentless in his criticisms of Chairman Wang. In a recent public speech to party members, Deng described Wang as a venomous opportunist, a snake in the Party who was merely turning the comrades against one another contrary to the ideals of the late Dr. Sun. Wang is a patient man but his patience grows thin. Day after day, Deng has lobbed insults towards Wang and his family - in particular his wife, who Deng has disaffectionately referred to as \"laotaipo\" (the old woman). Despite their differences, there is a degree of respect between the two men - both are early Cantonese party members and both worked and studied in Europe during the Kuomintang's exile. Yet for Wang, the Residence Faction (especially Chen Bijun), have been pressuring Wang to take out the threat once and for all.\n\nIn the dead of night, Li Shiqun, Wang's bodyguard and trusted hand suddenly received summons from the Chairman to his office. After a brief discussion, Wang quietly instructed Li to \"do something about Deng\" and to take him out before he becomes too much of a threat to the revolution. At once Li agreed and the plans have been drawn up to either have secret services abduct and strangle Deng in the middle of the night or to shoot him in broad daylight as to make an example of all traitors to the Kuomintang."
 CHI.lategame.264.a: "In broad daylight, as a warning for all."
 CHI.lategame.264.b: "Do it in his car, make it quiet and painless."
 CHI.lategame.265.t: "Exorcising the Shadow"
 CHI.lategame.265.d: "The news of Deng's death slowly trickled in. Wang did not bother to fake much surprise at the turn of events, and most senior members of the party knew what happened anyway, though kept their mouth shut. The message sank in all the same. All but the closest of Deng's associates had cut ties with him by this point, and even his inner circle could do little but sit helplessly.\n\nSong Qingling has fallen into a deep grief, one people say she had not expressed since her husband died. Whether she really was having an affair with Deng or if they truly were like brother and sister like they said was moot: she will not be much of a threat in the future. Her request to leave the country and go into exile has been denied, she will probably spend the rest of her life in effective house arrest, with agents watching her from the shadows.\n\nSpeaking of which, the blame for Deng's death was assigned to the elusive, sinister forces of the military deep-state. Dai Chunfeng was publicly charged for the crime and arrested before he could slink back underground. A convenient scapegoat, removing him kills two birds with one stone. Few will believe his pleas of innocence during the show-trial - a fitting end to a monster.\n\nHis associates are another question. For better or for worse, Hu Zongnan and his clique have a degree of popularity and make up a major segment of the \"Young Guard\" that by and large remained loyal to us during the PAC rebellion. Even though they did not join with the rebels, they are still a threat, and if there was any time to eliminate them, now would be it."
 CHI.lategame.265.a: "They will join him in the gallows!"
 CHI.lategame.265.b: "They will be shuffled into irrelevance."
 CHI.lategame.271.t: "The Palace Coup"
 CHI.lategame.271.d: "With peace talks stalled, the war continues. Chen Bijun and the Residence Faction did not wait for matters to shake out before they made their move. From top to bottom, they worked to consolidate the President's grip over the Executive Yuan - insisting on utter, dogmatic loyalty to Chairman Wang. Reconstruction Faction, Provisional Action Committee, independents, and even some wavering members of the Reorganised Comrades Association and League of Chinese Syndicalists were removed from their positions across the bureaucracy, replaced with an obedient mixture of Residence Faction scions and die-hard RCA members.\n\nSuch a blatant power-grab would be unthinkable even a few months ago, but there is no one left to oppose this self-coup. Whatever friction between the Residence Faction and RCA leadershp appears to have temporarily subsided as they circle the wagons to protect their shared master. Like the patronage networks of old, unquestioning loyalty is rewarded and there is no shortage of prospective \"clients\" for the pro-Wang political machine. In some cases, outright loyalty tests have been demanded - the Residence Faction living up to their derogatory \"Palace Faction\" nickname.\n\nWithin just a few weeks, the work was done. Chen Bijun, Chu Minyi, and Zeng Zhongming have done their job well - the patrons of this reformed hiearchy. Wang's place at the top has been entrenched and they have built a buzzing army of magistrates waiting to carry out his every word."
 CHI.lategame.271.a: "One nation. One government. One vision."
 CHI.lategame.272.t: "Gu Shunzhang's Betrayal"
 CHI.lategame.272.d: "The schemes in Nanjing have not gone away, even as the nation lurches towards civil war. The weeks leading up to the crisis, it was evident that all factions were firing off desperate gambits, working any angle to get ahead of their opponents. Often the fog of war conceals intrigue until it is too late, we are very lucky to have learned thanks to some well-placed sources of a devastating defection: that of Gu Shunzhang.\n\nGu Shunzhang was a founding member of Zhou Enlai's Red Squad, his family have always been prominent revolutionaries and he was even considered a potential candidate for the Central Executive Committee. One of Zhou Enlai's chief lieutenants, he was known for his cunning personality, courage under fire, taciturn matter of speech and strong personality.\n\nThe latter attribute, combined with general clique-ishness in the Red Squad and concerns about his personality pushed Zhou and Chen Geng to consider reassigning him from his position. Perhaps he learned of this and that's why he flipped. Or maybe he feared Wang would not be in power too long and wanted to join the winning side. Maybe he was blackmailed into it. Whatever the case, it appears that through his former connections with the Green Gang he has switched his allegiance to Dai Chunfeng and his rival League of Ten.\n\nThe Hu Zongnan and the CRS have been exploiting the chaos to their own ends and Dai is an integral part to their covert operations. What he is planning specifically remains a closely guarded secret, but it is surely nothing good. With such a valuable asset in his camp, he knows of most of our embedded agents and most vital operations - a disaster in the making."
 CHI.lategame.272.a: "We must act quickly!"
 CHI.lategame.273.t: "Triumph of the Red Squad"
 CHI.lategame.273.d: "Zhou Enlai, busy with many other commitments, often delegated out most of his responsibilities with the Red Squad to his lieutenants, but given the severity of the situation he has personally taken charge of handling the Gu Shunzhang affair. Unbeknownst to Dai Chunfeng, Zhou has an ace of his own up his sleeve - an agent at the very heart of CRS operations.\n\nXiong Xianghui has been Hu Zongnan's personal secretary and leading staff officer since his return to China. His father was a prominent judge with powerful connections and a bright young officer on his own right, he was recruited as a student by the Red Squad and sent to infiltrate Hu Zongnan's branch of the \"Young Guard\". One way or another he became a favourite of General Hu, all the while passing critical information to Zhou about CRS operations.\n\nWith Xiong's help, the CRS's next secret meeting place was uncovered - one that Dai Chunfeng would be sure to attend. In a carefully timed operation, Zhou ordered meeting to be ambushed by the Red Squad, decapitating the snake before it could strike. Hu Zongnan, Dai Chunfeng, He Zhonghan, Deng Wenyi and other leading CRS commanders were all killed by the elite squad- and not a day too soon. With the bulk of loyalist forces outside of the capital fighting the rebellion, they were attending a final meeting before executing a coup d'etat of their own.\n\nThe Red Squad's revenge on Gu Shunzhang was similarly brutal. He and his entire family was exterminated, over three dozen close family and extended kinsmen, shot or strangled by Red Squad agents. The only survivors of the massacre were his three year old daughter and two year old nephew, a graphic punishment long reserved for traitors to the socialist cause. It is one Gu himself had carried out before in the past, and he is said to have accepted his fate as our agents converged on him.\n\nWith his rival vanquished and Nanjing saved, all that's left to handle is the scattered survivors of Dai's outfit, running around like a headless chicken."

 CHI.lategame.274.t: "Fujian Falls at Last!"
 CHI.lategame.274.d: "The Jiangxi-Fujian zone was the base of Kuomintang insurgency operations, the last remaining holdout of Kuomintang resistance after the 1932 Shanghai Uprising. With favourable terrain, sympathetic locals, and indomitable fighters, wave after wave of encirclement campaigns failed to break them. They held out against Sun Chunfang and his League for nearly a decade, his German-trained divisions and concessionist funding notwithstanding. They even resisted encroachment by Kuomintang magistrates sent to reorganise them. And led by Deng Yanda, they were determined to fight off their former comrades in the National Revolutionary Army.\n\nThe campaign was fierce and deadly. Although many WMARCA officers ultimately looked the other way when Deng called upon them to resist Wang and many more defected after the loss of Wuhan, the ones who remained were often fanatical veterans of decades of experience between them. Hidden storehouses, well-placed bunkers, and reactivated communications from the old insurgency similarly made Fujian a tough nut to crack. As the army made their advance, well-trained commandoes ambushed loyalist columns, pinning them down as rebel conventional forces worked to outflank them.\n\nBut the new National Revolutionary Army is not the same as Sun's drug-addicted, foreign boot-licking farce. With an effective, non-corrupt logistical infrastructure and divisions well-versed and well-equipped for modern warfare, they shattered rebel forces. Nimble, fast-moving motorised units neutralised the guerilla threat and in the end Fujian was theirs.\n\nDeng Yanda died in battle, probably the way he would've preferred - surrounded by his comrades. Song Qingling was captured in her citadel and was taken to Nanjing to be placed under house arrest, her commanders surrendered one by one as news of the \"Red Napoleon's\" death made its way across the province. Fighting is on-going, though any hope of the rebellion succeeding has been snuffed out. Still, the region is a hot-bed for rebellion and has long been the bastion of resistance against the Chairman."

 CHI.lategame.275.t: "The Crown Prince Flees"
 CHI.lategame.275.d: "After Wuhan fell, Sun Fo and most of his clique fled for safety. Not cut out for life as a rebel, most sought refuge in safe-houses in large port cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou. With any hope of ousting Wang crushed, their ambitions of subverting China's socialist destiny has been brought to an end. Seeing this, most of the grandees of the Reconstruction Faction have taken their leave, fleeing abroad for expatriate communities and/or to find refuge in sympathetic bourgeois states.\n\nAmong them is Sun Fo, whose dreams of carrying on the torch of his father's legacy has once more been frustrated. Discontented and realising the futility in pushing any further for a Chinese state built along liberal lines, he has resigned his remaining government positions to go on sabbatical. He claims he intends to go on a goodwill tour to visit overseas Chinese communities on behalf of the party, helping to sponsor \"cultural dialogue\" with the Chinese diaspora. In many ways, he is back to where he started, the Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Commission.\n\nSun's decision to go into exile has calmed down fears of any further instability and saves Wang the awkwardness of having him in Nanjing. The funding he has requested is a pittance all things considered, just enough to pay for his lifestyle and make him seem like he's doing something useful. Still, there have been calls to cut ties with him for good, formally disowning him from his father's party. To many radicals, he is a disgrace to his father and shall die knowing that."

He is now the undisputed heir of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the master of China and finally has the power to change the nation for the better. He has come a long way from being the son of a failed scholar and a failed revolutionary assassin.\n\nWhile he basks in his glory, the politics of the nation are being shaped in his image. The Residence Faction, led by his wife Chen Bijun, his brother-in-law Chu Minyi, and secretary Zeng Zhongming have taken centre stage, consolidating their power through their hold over the Executive Yuan. They have done so at the expense of their long-time rivals within Wang's camp, the Reorganised Comrades Association - the political machine that has served Wang faithfully for years.\n\nThe RCA remains divided into camps of their own. Emboldened by the power they believe they now possess, the radicals led by Chen Gongbo, Wang Faqin, Guo Chuntao and the Gu brothers have proposed wide-reaching reforms to modernise China. They hope to redefine the United Front and draw the LCS closer to them, historically having pro-CSP voices such as Shi Cuntong, Xiao Zanyu, Xu Deheng and Liu Kanyuan.\n\nThe smaller RCA Moderate Faction now swells with many former PAC members. Led by Gu Mengyu and Pan Yunchao, they with the support of figures such as Zhu Jiqing and Lin Bosheng have pushed for avoiding class-conflict and reconciliation within the party. Moreover, some have even gone so far as to suggest reaching out to the non-socialist left.\n\nWithin the League of Chinese Syndicalists, the Chinese Syndicalist Party has emerged dominant now that the World Society has been rendered irrelevant. The radicals in the party have seen an upswing, growing as close as ever with Chen Gongbo's faction. It is clear that inside and outside the Kuomintang, China marches to the Chairman's tune - and he is free at last to remake the nation as he sees fit."

Opposition figures led by Song Qingling have gathered in Wuhan hoping to overthrow Wang, but it seems like their moment has passed.\n\nWang's situation is still precarious however, and he has sought to stabilise his position by reaching out to us. Ever the artful politician, he has sought to spin the situation as a positive - \"proof\" in his words that the majority of the party are willing to set aside our past differences. He argues that the Kuomintang have held up their end of the bargain thusfar, and it is now time for us to accept the integration of our movement. The elimination of his political rivals now smoothen the way for a lasting political accord.\n\nWang has been blessed with a silver tongue, but the sincerity of his offer is questionable. The Kuomintang does seem to be willing to engage in limited democratisation for the duration of their \"political tutelage\", and Wang has expressed some sinecere amenability to Federalist principles.

This has contributed headache after headache, as various hardliners and others denounced any accord with the people who betrayed the Eternal Premier. Meanwhile the Federalists, ever distrustful, continued to maintain their functional autonomy, a constant danger for the revolution.\n\nBut at last, Wang's efforts have finally bore fruit. After an impassioned appeal, the leading Federalist outpost in [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to surrender their arms and begin the process of fully integrating themselves into the Kuomintang's state apparatus. Combined with the destruction of the Provisional Action Committee and their WMARCA puppet-masters, the true healing of the nation can finally begin under a joint republican banner - on the esteemed Chairman's terms."

A well planned, efficiently executed strike will allow us to sweep away all the warring socialist factions, bringing a proper nationalist order to China free of French subversion. Still, with Wang's power having been steadily consolidating since he returned to China, toppling him is a tall order.

This action, meant to bring a definitive end to the warlord era of constantly shifting alliances and playing both sides, seems to have gotten its messsage across.\n\n[FROM.Getleader], the apparent leader of the old rightist Kuomintang splinter government, has accede to Wang's demands and disarmed any WMARCA militias in his territory, arresting PAC aligned opposition figures in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Our relations, long frosty, are not expected to significantly improve because of this, however their wise decision to bend the knee will likely ensure a quick stabilisation.\n\nThe primary beneficiaries of this decision seem to be the Moderates in the RCA, their anti-class-struggle standpoint being validated by the reunification of the party on relatively peaceful terms.

And yet, as he spoke, even a veteran politician like Wang could not avoid stumbling as he looked around the room.\n\nThe sheer hatred and antipathy in the eyes of so many of the delegates was a frightening sight, their withering glares betraying angry souls. They had already made up their minds long before the Congress. His time was up as Chairman, and he knew it. All he could do now was bow out with grace, saving what little dignity he had left.\n\nHe ended his speech quietly, thanking the audience for being his comrades of so many years, leaving the stage crestfallen. In the vote that came, he stood stoic and solemn as the delegates moved to convict. By a thin, but decisive margin, the Kuomintang's decades-long Chairman was deposed by the opposition.\n\nThe stunned room moved quietly and mechanically as a successor was chosen. Song Qingling was nominated and ran uncontestedly. By the next morning, Song Qingling was sworn in as President and China had a new leader at its helm.

Chen Gongbo and others are determined: the RCA will not go down without a fight. They have taken to the airwaves, denouncing the events at the Third Repatriated Congress as an armed coup.

Sordid rumours of an affair between Deng Yanda and the new President have spread, and her opponents have accused her of being a puppet for the military.\n\nAlready, the Executive Yuan has received a series of resignations by Wang appointees, crippling the bureaucracy. In the military and across the bureaucracy, officers have openly flouted commands by the new leadership, defying orders from Li Jishen, who has been entrusted by Song as War Minister - one of the few appointees she has made so far. The senior leadership of the CSP have waffled in face of the latest drama, but many of the radicals have begun organising wildcat strikes along with RCA-aligned unions as chaos engulfs the country."

 CHI.lategame.302.t: "The RCA Strikes Back!"
 CHI.lategame.302.d: "Outside the Presidential Palace, the sounds of protests have only gotten worse over the last few days as the RCA and CSP-Radicals have agitated against the new government. Riots have broken out in cities across the country, fanned on by a heavy-handed response by security forces. The hooligans in the CRS have only made things worse by sending thugs to attack strikers and kidnapping targets they deem \"enemies of the state\".\n\nSong Qingling never wanted this. An idealist at heart, she insisted on going the \"legal\" route to end Wang's tyranny - the only way, she believed, that a peaceful transition of power could be achieved. In any case, there should have been far more time, she had hardly been given a chance to govern. She has yet to assemble much of a cabinet, or even select a Premier as talks continue between the major factions that made up the anti-Wang coalition.\n\nWith the situation far from settling down (if anything, things have gotten worse over the last few days), it seems like China's new President faces a daunting challenge to her authority. The end of the Third Congress it seems will not be the end of the conflict roiling the party-state."
 CHI.lategame.302.a: "This was not part of the plan!"
 CHI.lategame.303.t: "The Coalition Wavers"
 CHI.lategame.303.d: "As the situation worsens, and a resolution remains elusive, cracks have emerged between the victorious factions that ousted Wang Jingwei. Shocking reports of violence and persistent disagreements between the governing coalition has given CSP leadership and many RCA-Moderates who defected from Wang's camp cold feet. The members of the World Society, who appear to be the most loyal to the PAC's coalition, have also expressed concern about the authoritarian measures used to suppress the protests even as the government ails.\n\nThe incorrigible Reconstruction Faction are exploiting the moment, with Sun Fo aggressively pushing for the end of tutelage and the holding of new elections. In his words, the only way to resolve the persistent disagreements within the party is to hold a national vote - as if that was not the point of the Third Congress. He and his affiliates have already been seen courting intellectuals and various centre-right republicans, working to corner the non-socialist vote.\n\nThe general consensus within the CEC is that Sun is delusional if he thinks the government would survive long enough at this rate to hold elections. Every day the situation seems to get worse and worse, and sooner or later enough party members will defect back to the RCA camp to beg Wang to return to power. Meanwhile the government remains paralysed by infighting, unable to present a united vision. Worse yet, War Minister Li Jishen has not been seen since yesterday - at a time when the country needs him most."

 CHI.lategame.304.t: "The Breaking Point"
 CHI.lategame.304.d: "Tragic news has reached the Central Executive Committee as War Minister Li Jishen was found dead by a patrol, having been kidnapped and murdered by extremists. After over two weeks of unabating instability, this was the last straw. Strong-arming the rest of the CEC, Song Qingling has appointed Deng Yanda as the new Command-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army, ordering him to take command of the Military Affairs Commission.\n\nIn rapid succession, arrest warrants have been issued for Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, Zhou Enlai, the Gu brothers, and other RCA grandees for sedition. Warned in advance by remaining loyalists in the Executive Yuan, almost all named targets have fled the capital, southwards to loyalist strongholds in Hangzhou. With the help of Mei Siping, Governor of Zhejiang, and sympathisers in the army, they have launched a desperate rebellion. Garrisons across the Five Provinces have reported conflicting orders and outright mutinies, while others weigh their options. For the most however, the army establishment has remained firmly in Song's camp.\n\nWhile in public the PAC's coalition partners have closed ranks behind President Song and her champion, behind closed doors they have made their resentment clear. They have demanded Song honour her promises of being a much less authoritarian leader than Wang, helping form a consensus rather than rule by fiat. On the other hand, many members of the WMARCA have called for decisive action, and the Central Affairs Commission has offered to lend a helping hand in \"bypassing\" partisan bickering if helps stabiise the country. With the prospect of civil war looming, Song Qingling narrows on a decision."

 CHI.lategame.310.t: "The Emergency Coalition"
 CHI.lategame.310.d: "In every unity government, there is often a lot of yapping and the new CEC is little different. Sun Fo and his Reconstruction Faction allies whine about socialist excesses and hawk constitutionalist principles as it suits them. Gu Mengyu, Pan Yunchao and the other RCA-Moderates struggle to find their bearing in a changing republic, seen as traitors to Wang's camp and flip-flopping on major issues to compensate. Meanwhile the League of Chinese Syndicalists remain hopelessly divided, with the Chen Duxiu-Li Lisan based Orthodox Faction of the Chinese Syndicalist party desperately fighting to control their own party. All the Elders in the World Society seem compatible enough but often find themselves in their own world, high atop their ivory tower.\n\nThe PAC's control of the military has given them a major source of leverage, forcing these disparate factions to the negotiating table. The infighting within the party has long been detrimental to the war effort, and Song Qingling is unwilling to make the same mistake. Still, the civilians of the PAC such as Zhang Bojun and Peng Zexiang have begged her to reach out to their allies, placating at least some of their concerns. Although plenty of it is smoke, there are some valid questions of why we did what we did and whether or not the RCA's accusations against us have any weight. The diplomatic Chen Youren, party elder Peng Zemin, and her brother Song Ziwen have all offered to mediate in talks.\n\nUltimately, however, it is up to Song Qingling to demonstrate her leadership. She recognises that many joined the opposition to Wang's rule for different reasons. Many hated his authoritarian style of rule, and feared a party-dictatorship under the RCA. Others resented the RCA's corruption, their tendency to twist major institutions to further their own (often personal) ends. As she works to win over her erstwhile allies, she reminds them why they fight."

 CHI.lategame.311.t: "The End of the Rebellion"
 CHI.lategame.311.d: "The fight against Wang loyalist forces was hard fought but brief. Under Deng Yanda and Huang Qixiang's brilliant leadership, rebelling National Revolutionary Army units were cordoned off and surrounded before they could unite into a cohesive fighting force. The rest were herded into untenable strongholds, besieged by considerably larger PAC-aligned armies.\n\nThe rebellion had hoped that there would be a great uprising of Political Department cliqued oriented divisions, MMIC trained \"Young Guard\" unit, and independent-minded officers willing to fight back against the new government's overreach. But the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association held firm, and Deng Yanda ensured the bulk of the army remained loyal to Song's forces.\n\nWith Hangzhou and a few other cities surrounded, and with little relief in sight, one by one they were forced to surrender. Unwilling to bear a siege and fearful the PAC would begin shelling the city soon, Wang overruled his lieutenants and ordered his allies to lay down their arms rather than go down in a fiery last stand. Before the city fell, Chen Gongbo, Chen Shaoyu, and other affiliated radicals took the last few tickets out of the country. The fleet has tacitly allowed them to depart unmolested.\n\nThe next time a CEC delegation saw Wang and his wife, the former Chairman looked haggard. He spoke politely, even to Song (though avoided making eye-contact), but seemed to resigned to his fate. The broken man inspired pity from some of his old comrades, particularly Gu Mengyu's faction, who have joined with Chen Bijun to plea for charity on his behalf. They recommend we use his international celebrity to send him overseas to live out his days in exile. Others however insist this is a ploy by an experienced snake, and demand he be brought to justice once and for all."

 CHI.lategame.320.d: "Somber was the mood in the Legislative Yuan as the grim bill made its rounds. There was some expectation of resistance, particularly from the RF and LCS, but ultimately little came of it besides an outspoken hot-head or two. Ultimately the alliance that claimed to be fighting for freedom was reduced to a resigned silence as it was debated and voted on, grinding their teeth but providing a unanimous vote.\n\nWith its passage, a state of emergency has been declared over four provinces (Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Hubei) believed to have entrenched RCA or CSP-Radical support bases. The Military Affairs Commission led by Deng Yanda was given a wide-latitude to enforce order for the duration of the emergency and add smaller subdivisions to the list as they deem appropriate. The emergency was to last for three years, with the possibility of extension, but the \"Red Napoleon\" took less than three weeks.\n\nWith often great violence, rebelling strongholds were stormed by National Revolution Army units - blasting away hastility erected fortifications with artillery. Retribution was often swift and severe, with paramilitaries going door-to-door to arrest suspected RCA sympathisers and CSP-Radicals. Disappearances and gruesome stories have made their way to the press, outpacing our censors' ability to stop them, giving Deng a reputation as a butcher. In the chaos, it has been reported that RCA affiliates Shi Cuntong and Zhou Enlai have perished in the onslaught.\n\nAlthough much of the barbarity can be attested to CRS militias, given the sheer scale of the campaign the WMARCA can hardly escape blame either. In an event no censor could hide, Wang Jingwei was captured and executed, his body left in a public square before more senior personnel could stop it.\n\nThe ferocious violence has severely shaken Chinese society to its core. Some of her advisors have begged that martial law be lifted and for the militias to be reigned in before they can do further harm, while others demand we remain vigilant as reports of gunfire continues. Song Qingling, who had banked her crediblity backing this plan, is expected to say something about her predecssor's demise to a terrified nation."

 CHI.lategame.321.d: "After Wang's death, orders were handed down to ensure none of the other \"big names\" in his government be harmed. Most surrendered peacefully or were otherwise captured (largely) unscathed, and were quickly placed under careful security detail by trusted units in Nanjing. A hurried trial was scheduled, unsuccessfully hoping to avoid media scrutiny.\n\nLeading figures of Wang's regime faced the court, with their legal teams scrambling to defend them from charges of sedition. The prosecution has elected to throw in charges of impropriety and misrule from even before Wang's ouster, hoping to delegitimise his reign from the beginning. Chen Gongbo was unrepentent, defending his and Wang's actions vigorously. Chen Bijun likewise defended her husband, refusing an offer for clemency in exchange for admitting guilt. Zeng Zhongming and Chu Minyi remained mostly quiet, though occasionally took their chances to mess with the prosecution.\n\nLower level figures, whose convictions were far less of a guarantee, were less staunch in their defence. General Zhang Zhizhong claimed he and his men were following orders, and that the constitutional chain of command was questionable given that Wang was only impeached from Chairmanship of the party rather than the Presidency.  Other figures such as Zhou Fohai and Li Shiqun asked for clemency turning on their fellow defendents.\n\nThe trial has been heavily politicised, perhaps inevitably, though many have accused it of being a show-trial. The Moderates in the RCA have begged for some leniency here, though with thousands now dead someone needs to take the blame."

 CHI.lategame.340.d: "In the end, the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang is provisional no more. Having toppled the tyrannical Wang Jingwei, Song Qingling and her allies now stand as masters of a reforged China's fate. They have begun the rebranding process, calling themselves the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang in an effort to assert themselves as the legitimate heirs of the party.\n\nThe fallout of the Third Repatriated Congress has not been pretty at all. The political landscape is rapidly changing as people adapt to the new leadership and the power-vacuum that has emerged with the RCA's collapse. Many of the factions that had aligned with the PAC are not happy about the way the WMARCA flexed their military muscle, and their commitment to the Revolutionary Committee is wavering.\n\nDeng Yanda has emerged as an object of scorn for many within the party, jealous or fearful of his seemly assured status as the second most powerful figure in the nation. Other, more junior ranked members of the PAC have been rewarded with prominent posts in the new RC-KMT dominated government. Of the military wing, Huang Qixiang, Zhang Yunchuan, and Guo Guanjie have been the most prominent. Of the civilian wing, Zhang Bojun, Peng Zexiang, Chen Youren, He Xiangning, and Peng Zemin now work to harness the PAC's legislative arm. Minor figures such as Li Xiju, Li Shihao, and Tao Xisheng find themselves in positions of power, and Song has also sought the counsel of her brother Song Ziwen and brother-in-law Kong Xiangxi (H.H.

 CHI.lategame.341.d: "In the latest evidence of turmoil within China's supposedly victorious Kuomintang party-state, it seems that Wang Jingwei has been impeached by members of his own party. In his place, Song Qingling had been hurrily sworn in with the backing of the opposition, a move which was decried as a military coup d'etat by the loyalists of the downed Chairman. Violence has only escalated as security forces harshly crack down on anti-government protests, and the nation has been thrown into chaos.\n\nIt matters little who is at fault when the entire system of oppression is the cause of this strife. It is clear that the much touted \"stability\" the party's dictatorship claims to provide is but a myth - an excuse to keep others out of discussion while their leaders slaughter one another for power. Song Qingling and her clique have long taken a hard line against the Federalist movement, often out of personal animosity. And although Wang and his ilk claim to be the \"architects\" of our recent Kuomintang-Federalist accords, it is plain to see that those deals were nothing more than a means of consolidating power around himself.\n\nThere is little time to spare then if we wish to ensure a genuine democracy can take hold in China. We must march now while the Kuomintang is weak to overthrow Nanjing, rallying whatever factions are left in the nation against the vile party-state. There will be risks of course, and some of the more liberal factions of the anti-Wang opposition led by Sun Fo have tried to extend an olive branch of their own, saying that if we throw our lot with them they will ensure the worst excesses of socialist dictatorship will be avoided. But it is hard to take that at face value when the entire corrupt system that Kuomintang's \"Republic\" has built can only foster further tyranny in the future."

[FROM.GetLeader] has quietly offered his congratulations to President Song on her election, tacitly accepting the status quo in hopes of preserving the Kuomintang-Federalist accords brokered by her predecssor and the Reconstruction Faction.\n\nWhether or not history will remember this as the correct decision remains to be seen. Song and the PAC have long railed against negotiations with the Federalists, and the alliance remains in peril. Further integration of Federalist aligned provinces may very well spark a broader conflict in the near future, but it seems that the [FROM.GetLeader] has shifted towards a more pacifistic tract.\n\nInstead of revolting while the Kuomintang is distracted by internal conflict, he has thrown his lot with Sun Fo and the liberals of the Reconstruction Faction, hoping that Federalist resources will buffer what might now be the leading alternative to Song and Wang's rule. The future is uncertain for liberal democracy in the nation, but the end is not yet."

As accusations flew of a coup and violence escalated, a harsh crackdown against Wang's RCA ensued.\n\nAs the nation lurches into yet another bout of instability, the new President of the Republic has hurried to try and secure support for her fledging government. This included contacting [ROOT.GetLeader] through both direct telegrams and various intermediaries, hoping to line up our support. In addition to bribes and threats, they have also sought to guilt us - saying that we owe them for our \"successful\" merger of the party and using our mutual contacts in the military to ramp up pressure upon us.\n\nPolitical grandstanding aside, the party's centre-right has sought to enlist our support, eyeing a future for the party stripped of the socialist corruption that has plagued it for decades.

 CHI.lategame.344.d: "Victory is often a magnet. Despite all the divisions and rifts, the Kuomintang's various splinters have coalesced under one government, perhaps attracted by the power at stake. The opposition against Wang, already wide and unwieldy, has gained another ally with the long-delayed absorption of the [FROM.GetAdjective]-based rightist central committee into their post-Wang government.\n\nThis has buoyed Sun Fo and his allies' political chances, strengthening his bid to assemble a broad rightist coalition within the party to advance his dreams of the chairmanship. It has also drawn in plenty of rightists and militarists, long a scourge of the party, which threatens the integrity of the party-state as a whole.\n\nThis final fulfillment of party unification, while far from perfect, more optimistically can be seen as proof of the enduring power of Sun Yat-sen's principles to call a nation together. It remains to be seen whether or not this unity will bring about positive political change, or simply entrench existing divisions that will have to be relitigated ad nauseam, but the Kuomintang are now one - at least for now."

Braving a fusillade of slander and accusations of tyranny, he began his speech, hoping to reassert control over the situation. Many of his allies were shouting back, hoping to drown out the hecklers.\n\nWang was an experienced politician, but even this was too much - particularly a repeated charge by the crowd that he had orchestrated the assassination of various political opponents to rise to the top. His speech, elegant in his mind and initially delivered with practiced eloquence soon turned into an unhinged rant, dooming the convention. He rebuked his opponents, screaming of the presence of counter-revolutionary traitors in their midst.\n\nOne by one, members of the congress were called for a roll-call vote. By just four votes, Wang escaped impeachment as Chairman by the party, though the PAC have made it clear they intend to press their case in the Control Yuan to remove him as President. Ultimately, such constitutional niceties drew far less attention than when the ensuing vote for the next Party Chairman devolved into a fist-fight by delegates as the election became contested by Wang Jingwei, Song Qingling and last minute candidate Sun Fo.\n\nWasting little time, Wang decided as incumbent Chairman of the party to suspend elections and quash the proceedings, arguing that the violence made a fair vote untenable. He has announced a preliminary cabinent, with Chen Gongbo was his Vice Chairman of the CEC and Sun Fo as his Premier of the Executive Yuan.\n\nFeeling betrayed by the Reconstruction Faction, who appear to have lost faith in the opposition alliance, Song Qingling and her allies have walked out of Congress rather than confirm such an undemocratic measure. Fearing they will be arrested to ensure quorum (and a favourable vote for Wang), they have fled the capital."

Led by Song Qingling and the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang, they have declared Wang's rule illegitimate and contrary to the principles set forth by Sun Yat-sen. Various dissidents have gathered there as they work to form their own central committee rival to Nanjing. Most troubling is the defection of War Minister Li Jishen to their cause, fueling further fears of military betrayal.\n\nIt is clear by this point that there will be no return to the status quo, and neither side has any intention of tolerating another ineffectual power-sharing agreement. The Kuomintang stands divided, and garrisons around the country are weighing their options as they figure out which side to back.\n\nBack in Nanjing, the Reconstruction Faction have driven a hard bargain in exchange for their support. They have secured as collateral Sun Fo as Premier, which they believe will give them control over the Executive Yuan. They have pressed for further reforms in legislature, reconstruction, and constitutional matters.\n\nThe incumbent President Wang Jingwei could hardly focus on their petty politicking however. The experience at the Third Congress has shakened the man, laying bare his sheer unpopularity. Against the advice of Chen Gongbo, he is determined to personally go south to Fujian as a sign of good will - claiming he has the negotiating experience to broker a truce before the situation grows out of control.\n\nOthers, however, suspect that his true intentions are to shore up his support in southern coastal cities like Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Xiamen. They accuse him of reaching out to RCA and radical CSP militias to reinforce his power-base in preparation for a self-coup. Whatever the case, the four armoured cars of the Presidential motorcade left Nanjing this morning, heading southwards."

Wang is the latest casualty in China's cycle of death, a perpetrator and victim in the nation's bloodletting. The Kuomintang may have brought order in their unification, but they have not brought peace.\n\nNo one quite knows who ordered the ambush. The specific path was supposed to be kept secret and despite promises of safety for a parley, Wang brought along heavy-armed security. At this point, no one cares. The forces in MinGan continued to gather in strength, pulling in defecting army units and sympathetic governors. Deng Yanda, who has been appointed commander of the rebel ground forces, has marched northwards with the bulk of his army to Nanchang - seizing the Jiangxi provincial capital.\n\nIn Nanjing, the central government could hardly contain the mayhem breaking out among the lower ranks. Chen Gongbo, as Vice Chairman of the Party, has moved to assume the duties of Chairman of the Kuomintang and President of the Republic. Sun Fo has contested his bid, arguing that as Premier of the Executive Yuan he would be the constitutional successor. Annoyed, Chen agreed to put it up for a vote.\n\nTo his surprise, the vote was deadlocked. The Reconstruction Faction should have been outnumbered, but nonetheless marched in lockstep. The Residence Faction, now decapitated with Chen Bijun's death and in total disarray, refused to commit to Chen's leadership - instead deciding to back Chu Minyi. Plenty of RCA-Moderates are also reeling from the news of Wang's death, and have expressed concern that Chen is too radical to defuse tensions in the party. Nanjing has been paralysed!"

Meanwhile Sun Fo has been making gains among the RCA-Moderates, while dangling the possibility of a peace commission. All the while, the army of Deng Yanda has continued to slowly make gains, rendering these discussions moot. Without Wang Jingwei, his coalition of supporters has fallen apart and Chen has reached his wits' end trying to piece it back together.\n\nSo he tried a different track. In the dead of night, Chen has reached out to leading military officers such as Zhang Zhizhong and Zhou Enlai, hoping to use the military to force things back on track. Besides Zhou's so-called Political Department Clique, Chen has also tapped into the ranks of MMIC trained syndicalist officers such as Xiao Jinguang. Combined he believed this \"Young Guard\" would be sufficient to turn the tide. Moreover, he has made contact with the increasingly resentful urban trade unionists, both RCA affiliated as well as those aligned with Chen Shaoyu and the radicals of the CSP. If push comes to shove, mass strikes will sweep him into power.\n\nUnfortunately for him, he was outplayed. His messages have long been monitored by agents of Dai Chunfeng and his scheme was promptly exposed. General Hu Zongnan, a rival for control of the \"Young Guard\", presented the evidence before the Central Executive Committee as a \"loyal servant of the revolution\". Chen was promptly denounced as a subversive and expelled from the party, though through some personal cunning he avoided attending the CEC meeting.\n\nHis Residence Faction and RCA-Moderate peers were often not so lucky - Chu Minyi was arrested and thousands of others swept up by the secret police.

Sun's most trusted officers, Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue have struggled to gain a handle on the situation and the latter has left Nanjing to take command of the Wuhan garrison.

 CHI.lategame.370.t: "The Garrison at Wuhan"
 CHI.lategame.370.d: "The tension was palpable in Wuhan, where Nanjing-aligned forces hurrily gathered. General Xue Yue had been rushed to the scene, ordered to hurrily prepare for an assault. This vital city stands at the intersection of the Yangtze and Han rivers, the heart of Hubei and the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution. The Wuhan garrison had received reinforcements from the central government, but far from enough.\n\nJust a few kilometers southwards, the armies of Fujian encamped, awaiting instructions from home. Led by the \"Red Napoleon\" Deng Yanda, he has brought some of his elite divisions for a decisive campaign. The only thing stopping him from making his attempt are mixed communications about a potential ceasefire, and neither side seems to trust one another.\n\nTo the north, the armies of [GetVictoryPointName_9843] are on the move. Realising the weakness of their position, inheriting probably the smallest fraction of the old National Revolutionary Army, Chen Gongbo has sent his division forward in hopes of catching his opponents offguard. No one quite knows where his army is, with conflicting reports from scouts, only that they have been moving southwards.\n\nThe garrison commander at Wuhan is therefore caught in a bind. Wuhan consists of three towns. Wuchang is the largest and south of the river, threatened by the advancing PAC force from Fujian. Hankou is north of the river, potentially threatened by the RCA-aligned army from [GetVictoryPointName_9843]. Hanyang is the site of a major arsenal, sitting on the west bank, but is protected on two sides. Xue Yue's best bet is to build up fortifications and concentrate men on one side, the question is which.\n\nThere is no telling how long this apparent \"ceasefire\" with the PAC will last, and Wuchang is probably the more valuable part of the city. On the other hand, the Fujian army has dug in so far, and it's unclear how close or even the intended destination of the [GetVictoryPointName_9843] army. After deliberating with his war council, General Xue has vowed to come to a decision."

 CHI.lategame.371.d: "Smaller, sleeker and imbued with high morale thanks to the stewardship of Zhou Enlai's Political Department, the RCA's army surpassed expectations with their southern campaign. Gathering in Baoding, they took advantage of existing rail infrastructure to move far faster than their opponents anticipated. Evading detection and utilising sympathetic counter-espionage networks to confuse enemy efforts to track their movements, the [GetVictoryPointName_9843] army under Zhang Zhizhong reached the gates of Wuhan with hardly any warning.\n\nMaking haste, they ambushed the lightly defended Hankou, catching the Nanjing army off-guard and sending the garrison into disarray. The rest of Wuhan surrendered in a rout, with little communications with the PAC-aligned Fujian army until it was too late.\n\nDeng Yanda, not wishing to sabotage on-going talks between his allies and the government in Nanjing, hestitated to make his move against Wuchang until it was clear the city had changed hands. Seeing his mistake too late, he attempted to rectify it by rousing his forces for an assault on the city's fortifications.\n\nThe advanced units of the Fujian army were brave but the PAC's forces were hopelessly overstretched - many of their units had been deployed during the ceasefire to Changsha. Their assault on the considerably more fortified Wuchang side of the city was beaten back with heavy casualties, and Deng was forced to order a retreat.\n\nBy the end of the week, Chen Gongbo entered Wuhan victorious. Delivering a speech before the city, he promised that the revolution that began in Wuchang would not be betrayed.\n\nAs he met with his generals however, the victorious army were forced to make a decision of their own. Although much closer to their traditional power-bases, their army is a long way from their headquarters in [GetVictoryPointName_9843]. On the other hand, making the arduous trek to Nanjing offers the tantalising possibility of ending the war earlier - if they were to succeed. With the high command divided between striking a potentially unprepared Nanjing or staying put in Wuhan to consolidate their position, it is up to Chen to make a final decision."

Their advance on Wuhan had already overstreched their logistics, and even with the Yangtze river they were taking a huge gamble. A gamble which failed to pay off.\n\nThe Nanjing government, long suffering from indecision, sobered up after their loss of Wuhan. Being the Kuomintang's provisional capital since the League war, it was already a reasonably well-fortified city. The assault by the [GetVictoryPointName_9843] army was rebuffed with heavy casualties by the assembled forces in Nanjing, including a few surviving units from Wuhan that were eager to get their revenge.\n\nAfter a few determined skirmishes and a fierce counterattack by Nanjing forces, the armies of Chen Gongbo were put to flight. In a campaign across Jiangsu and Anhui, the Nanjing army gave chase, their spirits lifted. However word of instability in the capital gave their commanders pause. It seems that the contents of what is being discussed with Fujian were leaked, and plenty are not happy with the terms presented. Whereas General Hu Zongnan has advised we finish off the forces of the RCA in detail, General Zhang Fakui would prefer if hold back and wait for talks with the PAC to generate reinforcements."

Although the [GetVictoryPointName_9843] army initially had the advantage, successfully ambushing the forward positions of the Wuhan garrison, as the Nanjing army fell back into their prepared positions closer to the city they were able to force a siege.\n\nHearing of the situation, Deng Yanda and his Fujian army has offered a truce (somewhat at gunpoint) to Xue Yue to fight off their mutual foes in the RCA. With some hesitation, General Xue agreed to allow Fujian forces into the city. This has allowed Nanjing forces to redeploy from Wuchang to Hankou, relieving pressure on the northern flank.\n\nUnfortunately, the joint Nanjing-Fujian command is not in as strong as a position as they would have thought. Many of Deng's troops had been redeployed under the cover of the initial ceasefire to take Changsha (which had not chosen a side yet), leaving the Fujian army somewhat of a paper-tiger. Despite this, Deng has insisted on taking overall command of the joint armies, pressing his seniority and also the greater experience of his men. This has caused some push-back, but Deng has appealed directly to his former Fourth Army comrade to trust him. In the end, the fate of the war may very well fall not on the policy makers in Nanjing and Fujian, but the soldiery in Wuhan."

Their opponent proved weaker than expected, having outrun their logistics during their rapid advance southwards. As a consequence, they were forced to retreat, barely keeping order as they pulled back towards Henan.\n\nThe soldiers in Wuhan were exultant as they celebrated their combined victory, and many expressed hope that their leaders would carry through in negotiations. A considerable number of officers have privately vowed that they would refuse to take arms against one another.\n\nIn their war room however, their commanders mull over their next steps. Xue Yue, an bold and sometimes impetuous officer, has insisted on following up on their victory - chasing down their routing foes while they have the opportunity. Deng Yanda however has expressed the desire to remain by the Yangtze to consolidate government control, a position that has drawn some suspicion that he intends to remain master of Wuhan. With their point largely proven now that Chen Gongbo's minions have been put to flight, there is some validity in what Deng has to say - surely most remaining undecided garrisons will side with the government.

With the help of some contacts in South East Asia and the Internationale, he has sought to secure key aid shipments from various allies to his capital.\n\nAdmiral Chen Shaokuan has been ordered by Sun Fo to stop him, but the number of seaworthy ships in the Nanjing fleet remains limited and the Kuomintang are experienced blockade runners.

Their unwillingness to divulge much information to the public or even prominent members of the government has been a source of ire for many in the Nanjing army, who fear that they are being sold out. Many of the rumours coming out of the talks however seem to suggest that they are inching towards a settlement more favourable to Fujian, hearsay often fanned by agents of Dai Chunfeng who is believed to be keeping close watch over the proceedings.\n\nIn the seedy underbelly of the city, away from the distracted eyes of negotiators, conspirators have been making deals of their own. In a last ditch attempt to get their way, military hard-liners have made their play for power by attempting to kidnap Sun Fo, seizing the acting President and scuttling negotiations.\n\nA dawn a series of rioting broke out against \"bourgeois\" elements, spurred on by various rumours of foreign mercenaries being present in the city, supposedly hired by the Overseas Chinese Commission. The overwhelmed police struggled to contain the mobs, which often included well-armed paramilitaries affiliated with the China Revival Society.\n\nSun Fo was forced to end negotiations early for the day and be evacuated by his bodyguard. As his entourage struggles to navigate the city to a fortified safe-house, CRS strike-teams prowl the streets searching for him.

With ruthless drive, they swept away any obstacles to perceived inefficiency, which evidently included what little democratic institutions were left standing in Nanjing. With minimal debate and at a rapid pace, the rump Legislative Yuan has voted to grant Hu Zongnan emergency powers as Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission.\n\nMuch to to Sun Fo's shock, Hu has ordered the Legislative Yuan indefinitely suspended for the duration of the emergency, concentrating power around the MAC. He was sure to place his friends in high places, with He Zhonghan being appointed Headmaster of Whampoa and Deng Wenyi Minister of War. Dai Chunfeng's specific position has not formally changed, but he's been lurking about in the shadows. Zhang Fakui has been appointed Director of the Hu's Headquarters, but kept effectively powerless as Sun Fo's faction find themselves sidelined within his own government.\n\nThe Premier thought to himself with tragic stoicism how remarkably dim the new CRS masters could be, for all their pretentions ultimately their solution to all problems was brute force. Should that ever fail, he mused, they would have nothing.\n\nThe test to see whether or not these young upstarts would even have a chance to rule is soon approaching. Deng Yanda and his army are on the verge of attacking Wuhan, defended by an outnumbered garrison led by Xue Yue. The convention decision would be to use a flotilla of gunboats and river transports to quickly relieve the city. But the bolder commanders have suggested striking Fujian itself while it is vulnerable, so convinced of their ideological superiority they believe nothing can keep them from their destiny."

To the relief of the swamped city garrison, reinforcements arrived by the river to help secure key fortifications outside of the city, beating back various probing attacks made by the Fujian Army.\n\nLocked into a siege and forced to pull back divisions from a planned assault on Changsha, Deng committed his forces against the city but struggled to make way as his weary and undersupplied men were often bested grinding against enemy fortifications. All the while, Hu Zongnan's main relief force made their way west, finally arriving after several days. Driving hard into Deng's right flank, Nanjing's elite divisions trounced Deng's exhausted forces, routing them. With his flank on the verge of collapse, Deng had little choice but to withdraw the rest of his army from the Wuhan campaign, breaking the siege.\n\nThe General and his men outshone their rivals that day, but now are forced to make a hard decision as their Wuhan defenders and their Nanjing relief forces link up. Reports from the central plains indicate that Zhang Zhizhong's RCA-aligned army has been on the move from  [GetVictoryPointName_9843], and their scouts has been searching for an effective crossing point along the Yangtze.

Reinforced with parts of the Wuhan garrison, Hu Zongnan's army has been in hot pursuit and advanced units soon skirmished along the field of battle. Small units of PAC shock-troopers move agilely behind enemy lines, hoping to secure an advantage for their artillery. Their foes have countered with swift mechanised companies and aircraft strafing from above.\n\nThis battle will probably go down in history as the ultimate showdown between the National Revolutionary Army's \"Old\" vs \"Young\" guard.

They are skilled in utilising the terrain to their fullest advantage and are well-practiced in a mixed style of combat - fighting both assymetrically and conventionally.

Instead, he and his elite divisions marched southwards in an ambitious operation, hoping to cut off Deng Yanda's supply-lines from its roots. The undermanned garrisons of Wuhan would simply have to hold out on their own, and once the Fujian operation was successful Deng's forces would be caught in a vise.\n\nThings did not work out as planned. PAC aligned guerillas roamed the countryside with the help of sympathetic peasants, picking apart isolated CRS units at leisure. Nanjing's supply-lines were quickly snarled and General Hu's army made slow progress across the Zhejiang hills. Despite their elite status and expensive equipment, their fighting capabilities were quickly sapped by the strains of the campaign.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Deng's men have quickly stormed Wuhan in a determined assault, with many soldiers unwilling to fight a hopeless battle for a tinpot despot. Learning that his foe was driving towards his home-territory, the \"Red Napoleon\" and his men had little time to celebrate their victory before they were forced to pivot southwards to intercept the trudging Nanjing advance.\n\nHis staff officers presented him with two different approaches for the looming fight. The first would be to face him in a frontal battle, further away from the MinGan heartland and its infrastructure but also closer to Nanjing as well. Some however have suggested delaying the pitched battle, drawing Hu's forces deeper into a trap and then encircling him in Fujian. Rapidly weighing his options, Deng makes his decision."

Hu is a stubborn man and a dauntless attacker, but once word arrived of Wuhan's fall even he knew it was time to cut his losses.\n\nHis decision to turn back and retreat towards Nanjing probably prevented him from being fully encircled, but his men had taken severe casualties. Deng Yanda's Fujian army and Hu Zongnan's Nanjing army did not make direct contact between the main forces, with neither side willing to take the risk of fully commiting their reserves. However, in the thickets and hills their skirmishers traded heavy fire in an intense week.\n\nBy the end of it, Deng had won a tactical victory though fell short of his hopes of fully destroying the enemy army. As he works to regather his scattered militias back to his main force, rumours have reached him that [GetVictoryPointName_9843]'s long absent force will soon by at the Yangtze river, hoping to make a crossing and strike Nanjing.\n\nThe pressure is now on for Deng as he prepares for a fateful choice. His men have been fighting for weeks now, and it will take time to reinforce his divisions until they are fully battle-ready again. But if those treacherous RCA loyalists, freshly rested, are able to Nanjing out from under him, all the victories Deng's men have won might be for nothing."

Sailors, officers, and even entire ships have defected in large droves, breaking any chance of a meaningful blockade of the Eastern seaboard.\n\nMany crews have been confronted with a common problem however, of where to go next? Many sailors are Fujianese and trained in Fujian academies, and consequently have familial ties with the burgeoning rebellion in their home province. On the other hand, plenty have received training from abroad and been exposed to Marxist thinking. The RCA and their unions have improved plenty of their lives, or at least promise to. And there is of course the countless clashes between the army leadership the WMARCA in Fujian embody and the naval establishment, always leaving the fleet with the short end of the stick.\n\nUltimately these choices are often made by individuals fleeing under the cover the night or perhaps smaller, tight-knit crews. But as an aggregate, they often represent enough to represent entire flotillas of China's limited naval capacity, potentially shifting the tide of the war."

Even as many in the military found their way into seditionist camps, Zhang remained a steadfast defender of the government and an anchor for which the civilian Wang and the RCA could depend on to fend off Bonapartism within the military. With a civil war underway, he and the Political Department Clique were the backbone in which the army of Chen Gongbo's [GetVictoryPointName_9843] government was built upon.\n\nSmaller than the other factions, they were nonetheless determined to prevail as they gathered in Baoding. Clued in thanks to some valuable intelligence gathered by Zhou Enlai's men, he learned of the CRS's effective coup in Nanjing. Based off that intel he recognised that the armies of Nanjing and Fujian would likely tire themselves out fighting one another and so Zhang decided to wait before leading his army down south.\n\nFresh for the impending fight, their vanguard has arrived at the Yangtze river, battling scattered garrisons hoping to prevent them from crossing. Nanjing forces have raced to blow up bridges to delay their advance as Zhang's men search for a weakpoint. Should they be successful, Zhang believes many remaining loyalists hiding in the Jiangnan and Anhui regions (the focus of RCA recruitment and development efforts for years) will rise up in support.

After some bumps along the way, Chen Gongbo's forces were able to rally and continue their push south against Nanjing, taking the capital in a renewed offensive. For an army initially in the worst spot, surrounded by disloyal garrisons and outnumbered by their peers, the bulk of the credit for their ultimate victory can only be accredited to the goodwill their fallen leader had generated among the people.\n\nChen acknowledged as much in his speech in [GetVictoryPointName_9843]. In a fiery address shortly after the garrison's surrender and an uprising of RCA loyalists in the five provinces, he promises to continue on with the revolution the way Wang wanted it, truly realising the Kuomintang's revolutionary aims against capitalist exploitation.\n\nWith his successful campaign against Nanjing, most of the outlying provinces and commanders have declared for Chen's faction - ejecting representatives from Nanjing and Fujian. The Fujian rebellion, realising the futility of the situation, has surrended. Song Qingling surrendered peacefully, though Deng Yanda's whereabouts are unknown - he has either went underground or fled into exile.\n\nIt does not matter anyhow. The people have spoken, and the conspirators vanquished. Chen Gongbo closed the ceremony by announcing Zeng Zhongming, Wang's former secretary and the scion of the Residence Faction, as the nation's new President while accepting the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan. Sitting quietly behind the new Presidential-Premier pair was Chu Minyi, looking utterly battered from his imprisonment - a drastic contrast to his once muscular constitution. It is clear who holds all the cards now."
 CHI.lategame.390.d.PAC: "No side really prepared for a long war, but after a few weeks it was clear that one came out on top in the end, avoiding fears of a prolonged civil war. Deng Yanda, the conquering general and the champion of Song Qingling and her Provisional Action Committee has emerged triumphant, sweeping all opposition. Though there may have been some stumbling blocks along the way, the experience of the officers of the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association proved decisive in Fujian's renewed push north against Nanjing.\n\nAs they approached the city, many troops defected to their side as momentum built. Li Jishen played a pivotal, if less acknowledged role as Minister of War, swaying many garrisons and governors still on the fence across the nation. By the time Nanjing had fallen, most had thrown their lot with Fujian, trusting the experienced commander. To the north, the wavering garrisons in Manchuria and Hebei grew fed up with Chen Gongbo's pretenses. Turning on him, Chen was arrested and exiled, and thus the nation was unified.\n\nTriumphantly, Song Qingling has been sworn in as President of the Republic. The Provisional Action Committee is provisional no more - and they have begun to rebrand themselves the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang. That said, her troubles are far from over. Her allies in the World Society, including Cai Yuanpei and the Four Elders who had backed her throughout the civil war, have grown disenchanted by the increased political role of the military. Likewise, the representatives of the defeated, including Sun Fo of the RF, Gu Mengyu of the RCA-Moderates, and Chen Duxiu of the CSP, all receiving amnesty in exchange for cooperation, have expressed concern about the future ahead."
 CHI.lategame.390.d.GOV: "Inertia is often difficult to overcome. Many garrisons of outlying provinces sat on the fence for the last few weeks under the guise of \"mobilising\", entertaining audiences with representatives of the various governments. Even those directly sitting in Nanjing, [GetVictoryPointName_9843], or Fujian were liable to for some wafering, knowing that failing to be on the winning side often carried deathly consequences. In the end however, the existing governmental infrastructure of Nanjing had a pull difficult to escape from.\n\nAfter major talks, Sun Fo and Song Qingling came to an accord, reforging the shaky opposition alliance that sought to oust Wang. Song has taken on the role of President and Chairman of the party, while Sun Fo has agreed to be Vice Chairman and Premier of the Executive Yuan. The specific makeup of the cabinent and other matters remain a source of continuing discussion, however for now the nation has been peacefully united.\n\nChen Gongbo's [GetVictoryPointName_9843] government has been betrayed by the fed-up Hebei and Manchurian garrisons, who marched into the vulnerable city with Zhang Zhizhong's army still prowling around the south. Chen has been allowed to flee peacefully overseas with many of his allies, while Zhang's forces surrendered to Deng shortly afterwards under the condition of amnesty. The China Revival Society lingers on, though heavily distrusted for their roles in recent riots. They will get their due soon enough.\n\nFor now however, Song Qingling and Sun Fo bask in the moment, co-victors in the fight against Wang's tyranny. Already cracks have emerged in their alliance though, and a schism is likely if negotiations fail to produce many results in the near future. Waiting on the wings is the World Society, which have played an integral role in helping Song take power. The CSP and RCA-Moderates are said to have been cowed by the army, though this is not the end for them quite yet."
 CHI.lategame.390.d.CRS: "Drastic times often call for drastic measures, but one must always ask \"at what cost?\" Beset with rebels on all sides, the disintegrating government of Sun Fo was forced to turn to military extremists to salvage their position. If their goal was to stem the tide and prevent a prolonged civil war, Hu Zongnan did not disappoint.\n\nHammered from north and south, the soldiers of the China Revival Society proved their might in an extended campaign. Even in defeat, many continued to fight on with the \"Whampoa Spirit\" of indomitable, fanatical courage that prevailed over Nanjing's enemies. Zhang Zhizhong's Yangtze river campaign proved to be a bust in the end, too far from their northern supply-bases to sustain such a violent campaign for very long. Brutally crushed in the ensuing fights, many of their units melted away or even defected.\n\nTo the south, Deng Yanda's renewed attempt to take Nanjing ultimately came to naught. After a few weeks grinding against Nanjing's fanatical divisions, most governors of outlying provinces had enough and sided with the central government. The garrisons in Hebei and Manchuria, having lost heart betrayed Chen Gongbo and forced him into ignominous exile. With most of the country against them, Fujian devolved into infighting and was forced to surrender.\n\nHu Zongnan now stands as the effective leader of the nation, having effectively sidelined Sun Fo and prevented any negotiation that might dilute the Kuomintang's revolutionary promises. Throughout the campaign, he has worryingly been addressing himself as Generalissimo, a concern that was fully realised today in Nanjing with his confirmation as President for the duration of the continuing emergency. Behind him is a camarilla of selected, primarily military officers of the CRS. Some like He Zhonghan prefer the spotlight (though never allowed more than the Red Generalissimo himself), while others like Dai Chunfeng and Deng Wenyi are content with machinations in the background."

The RCA have rallied under Chen Gongbo, one of Wang's most loyal and trusted lieutenants. Unlike Wang, he has expressed little interest in maintaining our alliance. To the south in Fujian Song Qingling, Deng Yanda, and Li Jishen have reactivated their old insurgency bases to contest national leadership. Often harboring personal hatred for Chen Jiongming and his Federalist movement, they have taken hard-line stances against us. In Nanjing Sun Fo's government would normally offer some hope for a democratic alternative, but it is widely suspected that his doddering regime will soon fall to military radicals.\n\nSo what would be one more contender? If it is obvious that none of the three contenders have any intention of implementing even the base-level Federalist ideals of local democracy, then any agreements we have signed are null.

The government's stake in the matter is ensuring that yields are sufficient to feed the nation,to adequately (and hopefully fairly) tax this major component in the national economy, and also to store grain to feed the destitute and also prepare for famines.\n\nWith the landlords either brought to heel or expropriated, the party has stressed that they are different from the greedy warlords that came before them. But some have soured due to the disparities in the new government's promises compared to the realities on the ground - much of the grain supposed to be going to public granaries have been stolen by corrupt bureaucrats and taxation has been uneven at best. Many farmers have refused to contribute, accusing our magistrates of being thieves. It is very difficult without good documentation to tax the farmers, and this type of bureaucratic infrastructure simply does not exist yet.\n\nAlternatives have been proposed, including taxing grain yields directly and eliminating other farm taxes altogether. Given how little is collected in practice, this would help increase government revenues but is bound to be unpopular with the peasants. But with wars and the debts that accompany them accruing, it is a tempting proposition.

Scholars at the time believed that an indirect tax on the people was best to fund the government without directly risking the ire of the people. Nearly two millennia later, salt remains a major source of wealth and power - though even before the warlord era it was a heavily patchwork system.\n\nThe Kuomintang has maintained their salt monopoly and its accompanying gabelle (indirect tax), and by some accounts it pays for upwards of a third of the government's overall revenue. Wresting salt revenues from warlords has been a major source of wrangling, tensions, and diplomacy though with the conquest of northern China's salterns the prospect of a new revenue boon has enticed multiple government organs.\n\nTo collect these taxes, escort funds, and enforce the monopoly entire regiments have been independently formed both by our predecessors and our new central government. These units are often well-trained and equipped, able to afford better supplies and often tasked with crushing rebellious warlords. The Ministry of Finance under Song Ziwen was one of the first to organise their Salt Gabelle brigades and consequently have the largest dedicated force. He insists on its necessity to prop up government banks and currency.\n\nThe Ministry of Interior on the contrary however insist such brigades belong under their jurisdiction, since law enforcement is a police matter and they have greater expertise.

Cambodians and Laotians have also been uncooperative with our Indochinese project, suspicious of their eastern neighbour due to historical conflagrations between the three groups.\n\nFaced with such a predicament, [CHI.GetLeader] has given local commanders discretion to solve problems on an ad-hoc basis; it seems that a final settlement will simply have to wait until the war is over. Still, the Kuomintang have not walked away completely empty handed. Inspired by the NRA's successes and hoping to claim a seat in the eventual negotiating table, insurgent cells in remaining occupied territory have reawaken. With any luck, this will be their the last conflict before freedom."

 CHI.lategame.701.t: "Xenophobia in the MSS"
 CHI.lategame.701.d: "The Ministry of State Security, despite efforts to improve it, has never quite had much pressure to reform perhaps its greatest flaw amidst the wartime atmosphere. Xenophobia permeates the agency, with staff members high and low suspicious of foreigners and even domestic minority groups. As part of Chinese efforts to cooperate with broader international socialist efforts, the MMIC has been reinforced with advisors led by Jakob Rudnik (who goes by a pseudonym Niu Lan and has also been referred to as Paul Ruegg) to help train and coordinate the MSS in intelligence gathering.\n\nRelations have been rocky. With the MSS dominated by ex-military and other ideologically vetted personnel, most are wary of their British and French peers. The more experienced operatives can remember times when they were arrested by colonial police in the legations, including Dai Chunfeng who was once humiliated in Hong Kong. To many, the British and French will never stop being imperialists, socialist or not. The arrival of Mission 204, also known as the \"Tulip Force\" of British and Australasian commandoes has only reinforced this perception. About 180 men in total, MSS officers have gone to the press accusing them of being politicians and adventurers rather than soldiers, and of being akin to a rowdy band of foreign mercenaries. Sordid rumours of theft, harassment of Chinese women, and commandeering local houses have been fanned by the press, taking tropes from earlier imperialist marauders.\n\nMSS higher-ups, for their part, have dragged their feet in reigning in their subordinates. Ministry leaders regularly bicker with their advisors and have been accused of being uncooperative. They have advanced a myriad of unsubstantiated but often accepted charges - ranging from the MMIC spying on the MSS to the MMIC bypassing MSS leadership to talk to the CEC directly. This prejudice, and the dysfunctional system it has spawned is unlikely to be fixed in the near future. But the MMIC has asked the CEC to step in and sideline the worst offenders, a power play they believe will alleviate at least some of the problems."

Across the countryside, they have used their authority to build training camps, officially for agent training but often indoctrinating large swaths of inductees into the China Revival Society. These camps are built far away from the prying eyes of civilisation, trainees often swear direct loyalty to Dai Chunfeng, and these \"forbidden zones\" are sealed off from even senior party magistrates (at gunpoint). Women have been banned lest they be honeytraps, and all agents are not allowed to marry while in service.\n\nDai's personal fortress is said to be built in \"Happy Valley\" (Geleshan), three valleys surrounded by a ring of hills and farmland. Anyone foolish enough to draw near to the electric fences without a transit pass were killed. The only outsiders that were allowed in are a few trusted MMIC advisors, often at the fringe of the mission.

 CHI.lategame.703.d: "Agents of foreign imperialism are ubiquitous in a land subject to nearly a century of colonialism. Comprador bourgeoisie, mercenaries, spies, and other collaborators of all stripes remain everywhere, threatening to subvert the revolution. Many threaten to defect to outside powers, fearing that native reactionary stooges have failed to contain the people's spirit.\n\nThey all have their excuses when confronted, but none can escape the the paranoid eyes of the Teke. With ruthless abandon and legendary precision, they have gone about eliminating enemies of the revolution. The euphemism \"special methods\" has now become a byword for the tactics used by the Teke, and it would appear these special methods are being used more and more.\n\nAs the Teke spring into action, most members of the party are prudent enough not to ask how the sausage is made and have elected to look the other way. On the other hand, there have been concerns, quiet at first but now growing. Some of those killed were prominent and not necessarily disliked by the public. There have been calls for greater accountability as the Teke expands from a small revolutionary agency to China's premier intelligence service, calling for the Military Affairs Commission to rein in the extrajudicial killings and implement some due process.\n\nThese concerns of course likely have ulterior motives. It seems that Zhou Enlai has not been afraid to use the Teke against internal opponents as necessary, particularly in his rivalry against Dai Chunfeng. Even outside of internal party rivalries, the \"Dog-killers League\" (Dagou tuan) has been especially contentious, responsible for killing alleged pary renegades. One has to wonder who the next batch of \"counter-revolutionaries\" will be."

After the expedition's failure, he fled for Song Qingling's MinGan Insurgency, where he developed  hobby for photography. In particular, he developed as fascination for \"realistic\" photographs unlike the international models that he would see in foreign magazines.\n\nHe would frequently travel across Fujian, taking photos of poverty-stricken children and families and would also go to Shanghai to meet and photograph intellectuals such as Lu Xun. With the Northern Expedition in full swing, he took the name Sha Fei (meaning flying sand) in order to document the revolution on the frontline. His photographs capture instances of military actions while upholding the Kuomintang cause as just and righteous, even in their handling of enemy POWs.\n\nUnfortunately, this talented photographer is now currently in a mental hospital. Weeks of photographing the bloodiest aspects of war, mangled limbs, military brutality, and devastation across China have taken their toll on the young photographer.

In Zhejiang, where there are many branches belonging to the Reorganised Comrades Association, party members of the Zhejianese RCA have urged government officials to prohibit traditional holidays such as the Mid-Autumn Festival - in order to preserve Nanjing's identity as the cradle of the revolution.\n\nThe RCA politician Zhou Fohai who is serving as Zhejiang's local SCRC chairman has declared that there are but three stages to human development \"the age of the divine, the age of imperial sovereignty, and finally the age of popular sovereignty (Minquan).\" As the latter is the current age of the Chinese Revolution, so it must be true that the people must abandon their traditional and superstitious worship of the moon. His comments were met favourably by many in the Radical Faction of the RCA, some of whom like Chen Gongbo have expressed that a total \"Cultural Revolution\" is needed to purify the degenerate aspects of the \"Old China.\"\n\nAs such efforts have aroused the local villages and towns who are protesting this seemingly intrusive move into one's local culture, local leaders have voiced their opposition to Kuomintang overreach; charging that the RCA is seeking to subvert local cultures and are seeking to overthrow centuries of tradition. After significant protests, the national government has relented for this year, though it is clear the broader battle is not over."

 CHI.lategame.803.d: "When the Republic of China was proclaimed in 1911 with the Xinhai Revolution, the style of dress worn at the time in China was heavily influenced by the Manchu tradition. Both the qipao and the changshan were imposed upon the Han peoples by the Qing as a form of social control. In an attempt to modernise not just the Chinese nation but also Chinese society (akin to the Meiji Restoration's effect on the changing of Japanese dress), Chinese intellectuals and the elite began to combine elements of both Western and Chinese dress.\n\nThe Zhongshan suit therefore is a product of such a cultural revolution. The tunic was introduced by the founder of the Kuomintang himself, Sun Yat-sen and features a suit based on the Japanese cadet uniform. The four pockets on the suit are said to represent the four virtues of propriety, justice, honesty, and shame while the five buttons on the tunic represent the five branches of the Nationalist government.\n\nThe suit's popularity since the Nationalist government's return to the mainland has exploded in popularity. Government officials frequently don the suit as a symbol of proletarian unity and as an Eastern counterpart to the Western business suit."

Beautiful women adorn the covers of recent editions, they appear to be shown \"moving in motion\" and participating in Western sports while dressed in Western clothes - making such editorials popular amongst soldiers in the NRA. Nonetheless, these women on the pictorial covers are not dressed to be seeking men, but rather they are living their lives and enjoying the high life in Shanghai.

 CHI.lategame.805.d: "The bicycle is a primitive and widespread method of transportation, one that the Nationalist Ministry of Transportation has been promoting. While the bicycle began to enter Chinese society by 1860, it did not win approval nor did it become integrated into Chinese society. Due to the fact that the bicycle was used primarily by Westerners, it became seen as merely a tool and curious handiwork of the foreign imperialists.\n\nFurthermore, the use of feet in the bicycle seems to deride the Chinese notion of luxury travel as many Chinese who were unfamiliar with the bicycle were accustomed to the rickshaw (as their feet would not be moved). Bicycles thus elicited a curious notion from the Chinese, who were inspired by the stamina of the cyclist as well as the speed of which one could travel on a bike.\n\nThe Nationalist Government seeks to expand transportation measures for those who are unable to afford an automobile. While initially a luxury item, the price of the bicycle has become so affordable that it is envisioned for half a million bicycles to be in circulation in China by 1949."

Descended from the the renowned late Qing General Zeng Guoquan (one of the brothers of the famous Zeng Guofan of the Xiang Army that helped crush the Taiping Rebellion), Zeng Xianzhi was born on January 23, 1910 at Baishutang in Changsha, Hunan.\n\nDuring the late 1920s and early 1930s, schools across China began accepting more girls and Zeng Xianzhi was a member of the basketball team of her local secondary school. Under the influence of the Chinese revolutionary and socialist Xu Teli, Zeng threw herself into the national revolution by joining the Northern Expedition as one of the few women at the Whampoa Military Academy. When the expedition failed, she fled for the MinGan Insurgency, where she became a political instructor and a traffic coordinator for the insurgents.\n\nHer dedication and selfless commitment to the ideals of the national revolution have recently earned her praise from the upper echelons of the party including Song Qingling who has described her as the ideal Chinese female revolutionary.

However, in our hour of need, [FRA.GetNameDef] and [ENG.GetNameDef] has sent us a squadron of volunteers from around the world led by the French pilot André Japy, an expert pilot from France. While most of these volunteers are French and British, there are also a considerable amount of Italians and reportedly even some Norweigen pilots; all of whom have arrived in China in secret, posing as tourists. These volunteers have arrived with Hawker Fury monoplanes and have come to bolster morale and train prospective pilots so that they, too, may carry out the fight in the air.

 CHI.lategame.808.d: "The socialist writer and affiliate of the LCS, the Marxist Guo Moruo has recently completed his play \"Qu Yuan\", based on the famous poet Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet and politician from the State of Chu during the Warring States Period. The play has likened the traditional Chinese literary hero to a \"people's poet\" and one of the first socialist revolutionaries in Chinese history. With comparisons made to Hamlet and King Lear, the play has exemplified Qu's social idealism and his great patriotism as a model for all Chinese to follow in this era of national revolution.\n\nAccording to the legends, Qu Yuan had served the State of Chu but had been exiled numerous times by his jealous rivals in the Chu court and thus spent his time in exile, collecting legends and rearranging folk oldes. In addition, he also spent his time writing great poetry and writing profoundly on the nature ofn the Chinese state. His anxiety however would bring him to an increasingly troubled state of health, and he was reported to have taken walks to view his emaciated face in the reflection of a well. In roughly 278 BCE, after his country's capital, the city of Ying, fell to the fearsome General Bai Qi of the State of Qin - Qu Yuan wrote a deep lament for the collapse of his state. He then ended his life, by wading into Miluo River while carrying a stone - perhaps out of sheer patriotism.\n\nA popular legend emerged, that villagers had attempted to sail out into the lake with dumplings and their boats to save Qu Yuan but were unable to do so. In their desperation, they beat drums and splashed water with their paddles to keep fish and evil spirits from eating his body. They also threw rice into the river to distract the fish but one night, the spirit of Qu Yuan appeared to his friends and told them that he had long passed, and that they should wrap the rice in silk packages to ward off the dragons that would consume them. These food packages became the famous \"zongzi\" and the racing of boats to find Qu's body, have become the cornerstone for the dragonboat tradition.\n\nGuo Moruo's play has become a resounding success in the Chinese leftist literary world and the Nationalist Government has been quick to capitalise on its success by declaring that Qu was one of China's first great revolutionaries. While some socialists have denounced the dragonboat festivals as pure superstitions, most writers do agree that Qu was a true leader of the people's revolution. His fidelity to his home country, his dedication to the people, and his works of art shall forever be immortalised for generations to come."

It seems that the left Kuomintang's Central Executive Committee has won that race, successfully conquering critical cities in their frenzied march northwards.\n\nOn the cusp of claiming national leadership, there are effectively two barriers in their way. One is the [716.owner.GetAdjectiveCap] presence in Manchuria. The other is us and our claims to a more democratic future. With the help of various intermediaries, primarily veterans of the old Guangdong Fourth Army, it seems that Wang is trying to drive a wedge between any potential Federalist-[716.owner.GetAdjectiveCap] alliance against him.\n\nInstead he has offered to reconstitute the old Constitutional Protection Alliance, with terms heavily favoured towards his camp. Leveraging the [CHI.GetName]'s apparent strength, in broad strokes he has offered to accept limited federalist principles and regional autonomy in exchange for the submission of our movement to the Kuomintang. His men have worked to stoke patriotic sentiment within our ranks, claiming that national unity to recover Manchuria is of the utmost importance.\n\nFaced with this difficult scenario, [ROOT.GetLeader] and his inner circle are forced to weigh their options carefully. Given the apparent instability of the Kuomintang government, it might be better to simply wait things out and find a better opportunity to resist. And if we are lucky, we will be able to nudge the party-state towards a more democratic end.

Although it would be a stretch to say our armies fought as one, it does seem like we now share a victory long sought by the party.\n\nUnfortunately for us, it seems that our leftist \"comrades\" have won the race to Beijing, successfully conquering critical cities in their long march northwards. On the cusp of claiming national leadership, there are effectively two barriers in their way. One is the [716.owner.GetAdjectiveCap] presence in Manchuria. The other is us and our claims to the legacy of Dr. Sun's ideals.\n\nWe have no love for the [716.owner.GetAdjective] bandits, but [ROOT.GetLeader] has little good to say about [FROM.GetLeader]. Still, plenty in the party and especially in the ranks of the National Revolutionary have sought to extend the pact that brought down Beiyang, and they have appealed to a common nationalism against the rising threat of Japan and other imperialists. Sun Fo and his centrist Reconstruction Faction has stepped into the void, publicly seeking to broker a reconcilation between the long warring Kuomintang factions.\n\nThe terms he has offered, ostensibly to protect civilian rule while moderating the revolutionary iconoclasm of the left, seek to be heavily stacked in favour of the [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] government. We would effectively be submitting our troops to their Military Affairs Commission while ruling autonomously in our own assigned military regions. Still, with patriotic sentiment at an all-time high, even within the [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it is very hard to turn down this chance to peacefully unite the nation. Perhaps at a later time we can push the party closer to our own vision for the future."

In exchange for democratic promises and inclusion in our decision-making process, [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to subordinate themselves to us in the name of securing Manchuria from foreign imperialists.\n\nThis represents the enduring power of nationalism within our party and though the planned merger between our rival central committees will likely take time before it is implemented. For now, time must be taken to build trust and individual matters coordinated on a more ad-hoc basis.\n\nWithin our own camp, there has been plenty of dissention. The primary drivers of this agreement were the Reconstruction Faction, who have gone to the public to secure such an agreement. They have been silently backed by members of the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association, though their usual associates in the Provisional Action Committee have tried to distance themselves from the matter. This has not stopped them from losing ground among the left to Wang Jingwei's faction as well as radicals outside of the party who have gritted their teeth for the time being. In private, accusations of the revolution being \"sold out\" abound."

On the other hand, perhaps our goals were always mutually exclusive from one another, and these calls for unity were merely wishful thinking.\n\nIn any case, as we trade insults of being warlord reactionaries and socialist subversives, it seems that the prestige Whampoa has long reveled in has taken a blow. Although the Reconstruction Faction were the more public face of these talks, the officers of the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association were widely seen as the muscle behind negotiations and its failure reflects badly on them. Plenty now doubt their credentials as an impartial force, the non-partisan reputation Li Jishen has carefully cultivated now damaged. As the PAC distance themselves from their WMARCA allies, their retreat has been harried by a rising anti-establishment, radical wave even within the military's ranks."

[FROM.GetLeader] has announced the merger of both central committees under a shared [CHI.GetName] banner, a move that reflects the waxing power of the socialist party-state.\n\nIn a speech, the former Chairman of the rightist faction has stated his desire to bring the nation closer to peaceful unification, and has touted the key concessions that he has wrought out of [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] in the process. Moreover, he has denounced the [716.owner.GetAdjectiveCap] presence in Manchuria, calling it an extension of foreign imperialism and demanding its prompt return to Chinese rule.\n\nThere are plenty of concerns however within our own camp. [FROM.GetLeader] was supposed to provide an alternative to socialism, checking its decades long contagion by the Internationale. This agreement can only serve to allow syndicalist influence to go unchecked within our borders, allowing for Red influence to expand its reach. Moreover, it seems that plans to merge the central executive committees has been delayed until after unification, further highlighting the right's apparent weakness.\n\nThere seems to be little word on whether or not we will even be included in these talks either, with [ROOT.GetLeader] treated as an afterthought in these discussions. On the other hand, with much of the old Kuomintang right folding into the Kuomintang government, we might have little choice but go along with it."

They seemed to have hoped for a wide rebellion, but with the old right Kuomintang centre having already accepted the accord as fait accompli they thankfully seem to be on their own.

Hundreds of delegates have been assembled at the \"Union Assembly of Papua and New Guinea\", colloquially referred to as of the Gung (the Council). The educated class among the native peoples of the islands is small and political consciousness almost nonexistent. Unlike in many other colonies where the Europeans had tried to uplift the natives and Westernise them, the native intelligentsia of Papua and New Guinea appear to be mostly limited to attendees of Christian missionary schools and a few mixed race activists who attended modern European universities.\n\nWe have found a willing figurehead for the provisional government, a former trade unionist by the name of Sumsuma. He gained great renown for founding the modern Papuan and New Guinean labour movements in 1929, when he led a major strike in the former German colonial capital of Rabaul. Sumsuma was imprisoned for his actions and even after his release he was forced to keep a low profile, retiring to his home on the island of Boang, one of the northern Tanga Islands.\n\nWhen the colonial rulers of New Guinea were pushed into retreat, he was elected King among the Tanga people and leveraged this position to try to form a new political movement. By the time our troops marched into Port Moresby and Lae, the name \"Sumsuma\" was already being spoken of with great reverence and he had apparently managed to coalesce his following into an organisation which he has dubbed the \"Committee of Thirteen\".\n\nThis Committee is the first native political party in the former colony and has actively been promoting what it calls a \"National Union\" between all ethnic groups and races of the islands. Owing to Sumsuma's background as a trade unionist and one of the more politically active native New Guineans, him and his comrades have been receptive to our anti-imperialist rhetoric. He does not actually seem to know much about socialism or the broader anti-colonial struggle, but even if his beliefs about workers rights, democracy and national liberation are quite vulgar and unhoned, he is still the best figure we have to coalesce our hold over Papua and New Guinea."

Of particular note are two regions that have been carved out as exceptions from the broader occupation policy, Singapore and Penang. The former due to its status as the most developed city in the Malay archipelago and a strategic military outpost, the latter due to its large Chinese population and historical importance for the Kuomintang. Penang Island was traded to the British in the 1700s by a local Malay Sultan, it was later settled by Hokkien merchants and coolies who were sent there to toil for their British masters, cultivating a distinct overseas Chinese culture with long-running roots in the region. Our Penang cousins funded and supported the Kuomintang and its precursors since before the days of Xinhai, the island was even once home and refuge to the great Sun Yat-sen during his exile in the 1910s. Singapore too is also home to an immense overseas Chinese population, numbering at around 50%-60% of its inhabitants, though not all of these necessarily identify with our own government policies of Pan-Chinese solidarity. As Singapore and Penang are both around 5000 kilometers away from China proper, to govern them will be an immense task for the government in [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nThough we can rely on the infrastructure of our liberated allies and advancements in telecommunications to speed up the process, it is clear that both regions will require the creation of autonomous municipal governments to fulfil their functions as outposts to spread and defend the Asian Revolution.\n\nThe solution has been the proposal of \"Tebie Xingzhengqu\" (Special Administrative Regions), which will have local governments drawn from the native overseas Chinese populations, as well as receive \"Zhengzhi Zhidao\" (Political Guidance) from the [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] appointed executives of regional Government Bureaus.

Truly, China's place in the world is in Asia.\n\nFor the last century however, this has not been the case. We have been humilaited utterly not only by the Western imperialists who tore apart the nations of the East under their banner of colonialism but also against the Japanese wokou who took advantage of our decaying state to pursue their own imperialistic ambitions. In our absence, the ever-burning cultural hearth of East Asia seemed to dim out and darkness covered our what was once maritime bliss.\n\nNow, things are different. The Chinese Kuomintang has led the Chinese peoples to pursue their salvation from imperialism and in doing so - were able to proclaim the Republic of China, a new revolutionary and socialist Republic free of imperialist influences. It is with this strength that the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Chinese Republic have been able to liberate and free thousands of our fellow Asian comrades across Southeast Asia. We have even been able to bring the revolution to the far icy reaches of Outer Manchuria, and our forces were able to liberate the Japanese workers from the chains of their tyrannical empire.\n\nIt does not end here. China's reinvigorated strength, China's glorious history, and China's prestige calls for it to play an even larger role in the world. Only China is capable of bringing together the vast Asian peoples under the banner of Pan-Asian anti-imperialism, and it does not stop there. We have created a zone of security stretching from Honolulu to Melbourne and covering every nation from the Pacific Island chains to India.

The Residence Faction is currently dominant, as they have long had the eyes and ears of the Chairman due to their unquestionable leader being none other than the Chairman's beloved wife - Chen Bijun. They have gotten to work at once by appointing members of Wang's family to leadership positions in the Executive Yuan - a move denounced as nepotism by members of the Reorganised Comrades Association. Governorship posts have also been passed around members of the Residence Faction, to which Chen Gongbo has remarked bitterly to the Chairman that he is feeling sidelined.\n\nNonetheless, the radicals are still a dominant force as the RCA controls much of the Legislative Yuan, and the RCA continues to lie dominated by its Radical Faction. Maintaining control of the RCA while it is dominated by the Radicals continues to be a struggle between Chen Gongbo and Gu Mengyu, both men representing the Radical and Moderate wings respectively. However, with Chen Bijun's ambitions as high as ever, both men worry that the RCA's hold on the government might be getting weaker daily.\n\nChen Gongbo had been temporarily appointed as Premier of the Executive Yuan, though his position grows less and less secure by the day.

They have issued calls for Wang to step down after years of leadership but their cries for change have fallen on deaf ears due to the dominance the RCA holds within the Party. Yet it is clearly evident that Wang's consolidation of power has certainly agitated the people. As long as the strikes and unrest continue, Wang's position of power will certainly be troubled and dissatisfaction within the RCA and the Residence Faction may grow as a result. If faith is to be restored in the Chinese Nationalist Party, the Chairman must act quickly to subdue unrest and to prove that he is worthy of carrying the mantle of Dr. Sun Yat-sen once and for all."

The military of the revived National Revolutionary Army in the MinGan Insurgency was largely dominated by officers and generals loyal to Deng Yanda's Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association. Furthermore, many of them engaged in the revolution in the MinGan zone for years, while the RCA and the Chairman stayed in exile.\n\nThere was also the India Clique within the National Revolutionary Army that is largely sympathetic to the ideals of PAC (many of them are indeed dear comrades of PAC officers) and the Reconstruction Faction of Sun Fo. The Chairman has denounced militarism within party politics, declaring that the military must be completely subordinated to the Party. He has ordered that while the military may be responsible for operational decisions, all administrative decisions must be completely handled by the Party.\n\nDue to the RCA's own influence within the Political Department of the NRA, the Chairman has ordered that the Political Department at once be expanded in order to encourage political indoctrination and to win complete loyalty of the army. Means of indoctrination and awarenes of the mass movement, would encourage the army to understand that they were merely servants to the Chinese people in the revolution and not a separate entity.\n\nHowever, these efforts have not helped rectify the state of the army. Those who have survived the purge, have kept their heads down and the army as a whole remains bitterly demoralised.

 CHI.endgame.241.t: "Three Approaches to Land Reform"
 CHI.endgame.241.d: "Feudalism as long been defined by political intellectuals and leaders within the Reorganised Comrades Association as the system in which the subsistence economy of China plays a dominant role in Chinese society. This system is one of inherent injustice as the landlords use political force to occupy the land and to exploit the epasants by plundering their products and forcing them to do free labour; in which the occupation of the land by landlords led to the total monopoly of political, military, and economic power. It is true that the coastal cities have already entered the capitalist stage but nonetheless, the backward northwestern, southwestern, and rural areas of China still belong to the feudal stage - feudalism is still the dominant force in China. Since 70% of China's population are still bound to a feudal society, it is the role of the Party to step in and to liberate them from their archaic oppression.\n\nMost in the Reorganised Comrades Association favour an aggressive approach of government nationalisation while also seeking to enforce fair land reform (although not for large landlords, warlords, or other local bullies). The lands of warlords, local tyrants, corrupt officials, and evil gentry are to be confiscated and that land is not to be sold or bought in private. Meanwhile, the moderates have advocated for a more orthodox approach of land reform  - seeking instead to reform land on the basis of land to the tiller.\n\nHowever within the RCA-Radicals, there are definitely those such as Shi Cuntong who have advocated for total land reform, seeking to uphend the social order by encouraging peasant uprisings and seeking to complete nationalise all land to the government."

 CHI.endgame.242.d: "As part of the new official party policy, the Chairman has formally subordinated the army under the Party- placing all administrative military decisions under his control effectively. Left unopposed by the Kuomintang's Central Committee - this move has been quickly approved and passed into formal law. Henceforth, administrative decisions such as the mobilisation of troops can only be approved by the Party Central - and those who refused to obey were to be at once arrested by their subordinates. Meanwhile, the Political Department has gotten to work through lectures and other means of political indoctrination, to help weed out those who will continue to be loyal to the Party and those who have to be purged.\n\nThe Political Department by orders of the Chairman has formally authorised the \"Moral Cultivation Movement.\" All soldiers and officers are to be drawn from the producer class - that is those of the oppressed classes (in Wang's definitions, this constitutes the petite bourgeoisie, the students, intellectuals, workers, and peasants). Furthermore, military members are taught daily that their function is to serve the people but also that the people should be taught that the soldiers are a producer class just like them. Soldiers are given only modest living conditions and harsh training so that the people can see that the soldiers are not living a life of luxary unbeknownst to them. If the peoples' rights are wronged by the Army, the Army is to respond immeditaely at once and offer through investigations to prove the army's subservience to the Chinese people.\n\nA few officers who had rebelled against Wang's leadership such as General Ye Ting, have asked that their commissions be formally reinstated and have promised to swear loyalty to the new regime. While the Chairman is certainly merciful and generous, the Residence Faction and the Radicals of the RCA have advocated for a harsh stance towards all who had opposed his leadership.

True, tensions had been simmering between the triumvirate of Hu Hanmin, Wang Jingwei, and Chiang Kai-shek during the Northern Expedition but since the collapse of the Northern Expedition - the Party has yet to splinter as much as it had during the Third Congress. Now, it is up to the Chairman to pick up the pieces of the shattered White Sun and to deal with the anti-revolutionary former Provision Action Committee.\n\nSong Qingling has since been placed under house arrest. Her position as the widow of Dr. Sun Yat-sen has made her virtually untouchable despite being heavily associated with the Provisional Action Committee. With the widow silenced, many of PAC's leaders have been expelled from the Central Executive Committee and the Executive Yuan. The Four Elders have been effectively quieted and have chosen to retire from politics while the Reconstruction Faction has mostly been thoroughly purged. Several however have been kept around such as Sun Fo, at the urging of the Moderates of the RCA who believe that Sun Fo's presence is needed to provide party legitimacy.\n\nThose within the Radical Faction of the RCA have argued that a new revolutionary leadership is needed within the Party to restore unity and cohesion. The radicals have urged for the creation of a new leadership staffed with members from the Chinese syndicalists and their own ranks. This is contrasted with pleads for leniency and even amnesty for those within PAC who may potentially be willing to participate in the Chairman's newly reorganised government."

 CHI.endgame.244.d: "The League of Chinese Syndicalists has finally come undone as the various socialist factions over the league have finally broken their long-standing shaky alliance in favour of siding with either the PAC or the RCA. In the chaos of the Kuomintang's Third Congress, the World Society had denounced Chairman Wang and had attempted to help the PAC dismantle the revolution. While the Residence Faction and the Reorganised Comrades Association had banded together with their syndicalist allies to help restore order and unity through the Party, there is certainly much to consider when it comes to the future of interparty cooperation between both the now emergent Chinese Syndicalist Party and the Kuomintang.\n\nThe Radical Faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party holds long standing ties with the Radicals of the Reorganised Comrades Association. After all, some of the founding members of the Chinese Syndicalist Party such as Chen Gongbo and Shi Cuntong now hold prominent positions within the Kuomintang. While members of the Radical Faction and Orthodox Faction had agreed on the notion of \"no class difference\" during the United Front policy of the Second Northern Expedition - their tone and rhetoric have escalated since the unification. Now, radicals such as Qu Qiubai and Cai Hsen are arguing in favour of a revolutionary class of intellectuals and leaders to lead the peasants to revolutionary freedom; and they have found a willing voice in their fellow Marxists within the RCA-Radicals.\n\nThe Orthodox Faction, meanwhile, under Li Lisan and Chen Duxiu, have been courted by the Moderates of the RCA, due to their willingness to forego notions of class struggle in favour of revolution for the oppressed classes. Members of the Moderates seek public opinion over the revolutionary organisational methods of the radicals, and thus they seek a potential ally in the Orthodox Faction of the CSP.\n\nThere are also those within the Residence Faction such as Chen Bijun who believe that the alliance with the Syndicalists no longer needs to be as intimate as it was before the Second Northern Expedition. To them, the revolution has already been won and further attempts to cater to the Chinese syndicalists would merely subvert the true leadership of Chairman Wang and furthermore - dilute the ideology of Dr. Sun."

 CHI.endgame.245.d: "Organisation is the key to success according to members of the RCA-Radicals, who believe that a truly educated revolutionary vanguard must be organised well in order to lead the National Revolution for the Workers and Peasants. Thanks to the dominance of the Radical wing of the RCA, the RCA has enforced its highly rigid means of organisation upon the entire Party.\n\nThe headquarters of the RCA and Chen Gongbo's main centre of operations is the \"United Office of Provinical, Municipal, and Overseas Party Branches\" - allowing Premier Chen to monitor and manage RCA activities within the country and overseas. It is further supplemented by the \"Chinese Kuomintang Party Defending Revolutionary Alliance\", an RCA organisation created in secret in Shanghai in order to win over the support of the Chinese socialists and syndicalists.\n\nNew membership to the RCA is a highly arduous process. A prospective member of the RCA could only be considered for membership provided that he knew at least two other RCA members. Following a probation period of one to three months, he would become a full member only if approved by the next level of hierarchy. RCA members are organised in cells of three to nine men, and the hierarchy is graded into sub-branches, sub-districts, districts, provincial levels, and national levels.\n\nAt the encouragement of the Radicals, a tight enforcement line is administered of the RCA in order to protect the unity of the Party. Meetings of local RCA cells are to be held every week and attendance is mandatory. All decisions from the Premier are to be assumed to be instructions from the great Chairman and thus must be obeyed no matter what. Mid-level to higher level members are encouraged to keep reports on individual members such as a report of their whereabouts, report on their residences, and a weekly activity report.\n\nFurthermore, the training programme of the RCA stresses that members are to follow a single unified ideology, to maintain stringent discipline, to obey the RCA rather than individuals, and to work with the masses. Nonetheless, the Moderates have petitioned the Premier to relax these standards, arguing that without the PAC - there is no longer a need to maintian such strict control of the clique. They fear such a harsh system will soon be extended to the entire party."

 CHI.endgame.246.d: "Like the Guofu, the Chairman has been blessed with a great family but with their position secured the \"first family\" of the Chairman continues to attract media curiosity throughout the country. Chen Bijun, his dear wife, has often attracted tabloid speculation due to her perceived \"ugliness\" and older age (despite Wang being her senior by ten years). Even Wang's inner circle like Chen Gongbo do not dare refer to Chen Bijun by her maiden name, lest they find themselves chastised by Madame Wang that even Dr. Sun did not address her that way. Chen Gongbo and others have frequently grumbled at the amount of power Madame Wang seems to hold, but Wang has said that \"she is my revolutionary comrade, for that reason I don't find it easy to make decisions without considering her views.\"\n\nAs for his children, Wang's eldest son Wang Weying was born in France in 1913 and studied economics there before ostensibly starting his career as an apparatchik as a military supply official. A playboy, he is known for his lavish spending and rarely participates in politics. Wang's eldest daughter Wang Wenxing has been known to hold sympathies for Song Qingling and has publicly denounced her father for dividing the Party. His second daughter Wang Wenbin is also known to privately harbor views against the RCA but she is studying to become a nurse rather than engage in party politics.\n\nWang's third daughter is his most beloved of his daughters, Wang Wenxun. Born in 1922 and renowned for her beauty and intellect, she is currently serving as her father's secretary and is a member of the Residence Faction. Finally, his favourite son is also is youngest, Wang Wenti, born in 1928. Too young to participate in politics, his father has spoken of his desire to see him follow in his footsteps one day.\n\nMadame Wang has also been eagerly staffing the national bureaucracy with Wang's outer family and her own family since the PAC have been driven from the Party. The Wangs, Chens, and the Zengs (Premier Zeng Zhongming and his sister) have joined the Sun-Song clan as the \"Four Great Families of the Republic\", though many RCA members have denounced this as mere nepotism and have urged the Chairman to focus on political merit rather than family ties."

 CHI.endgame.247.t: "Wang Jingwei's Theory of Democracy"
 CHI.endgame.247.d: "While most have catagorised the RCA as authoritarian, the Chairman himself has shown great interest in promoting the cause of democracy - creating what can only be considered a synthesis of the dangguo (party-state) and local self government. In fact, due to his courtship of the RCA-moderates, some within the RCA have even accused the Chairman of placing the issue of Minquan above the other three principles. Wang believes that without democratic forces, the principles of Minzu and Minsheng cannot be fully realised - as such it is imperative that the National Revolution ends in democracy.\n\nDemocracy in Wang's theory should be separate from the bourgeois democracy of the West (such as in the United States and the German Empire) but also distinct from the proletariatan democracy of the syndicalist nations. In his writings and lectures, the Chairman has written extensively on the idea of the party-state as being necessary for nurturing the growth of democracy. During the era of revolution, the Party plays an effective role in dispelling anti-revolutionaries and furthermore that Party-rule is needed to help administer local self-governments. After all, without the guidance of the Kuomintang - how can one expect the masses to realise their revolutionary potential. Furthermore, the people of China are used to autocratic rule and they would not be used to exercising their four basic rights if there is no Party to guide to them.\n\nMembers of the Moderate Faction of the Reorganised Comrades Association have supported Wang's theories as factual. They argue that indeed in the time of revolution, a class of exceptional individuals like the Chairman must constitute the vanguard to constrain populism and to help the masses achieve consciousness. However, liberal factions within the Kuomintang have argued against Wang's policies and these outer parties have pushed for Wang to conclude the period of tutelage. To them, with the conclusion of the Second Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance - there is no longer much need to hold on to the ideas of party rule."

An anonymous RCA member has written in one of the Party's newspapers that \"In the history of the Chinese Revolution, Mr. Wang is the longest serving follow of Sun Yat-sen and we can say that only Mr. Wang is able to continue the revolutionary task of the late premier.\" The Chairman has officially declared dates important to Sun such as his birthdate, his deathdate, etc as national holidays and bronze statues of Sun are to be set up all around Nanjing. Furthermore Wang is frequently photographed or seen around in Nanjing - a testament to carrying out the late premier's will at the first republican capital.\n\nFurthermore, in an attempt to further draw his regime closer to the legacy of Dr. Sun, Wang has personally ordered Sun's entrails (which had been preserved and kept in [GetVictoryPointName_9843]) to be sent to Nanjing as to physically reconstitute Sun's body. While this move may be seen as grotesque, for Wang having the eternal premier's physical remains buried in Nanjing - seeks to legitimise his rightful leadership of the Party."

 CHI.endgame.261.d: "Emboldened by his successful negotiations with the Federalist movement, Wang Jingwei confidently strides forward in consolidating his reputation as a republican statesman - officially hosting an \"Expanded Party Conference\" with the intention of addressing unresolved issues from the Third Repatriated National Congress. He has cordially invited the Federalist leadership, most notably the Public Interest Party and their allies in the Chinese Democratic League to the Conference, asking them for their input on the future of the nation.\n\nThey were shocked however, to find that Wang was far more cunning then they expected. The PIP and CDL were hardly the only ones invited, with the KMT being joined not only the LCS (now dominated by the CSP), but also various representatives from the Kuomintang's right and Feng Yuxiang's Guominjun. Various smaller parties and independents were also included (almost definitely \"vetted\" by the secret police). In a cruel twist of fate, Wang has manipulated the Federalists' demands for greater pluralism against them - diluting their influence with a deluge of smaller, competing factions that the wily Chairman can more easily control.\n\nWith few options but to accept the terms laid out by the Kuomintang (who still control a majority of both the provisional Legislative Yuan and planned National Assembly anyhow), the Federalists can do little but nod along and try and shepard the various \"third parties\" they can find. In the meanwhile, Wang consolidates his grip over the nation with flair - giving a series of bombastic addresses to the Conference exhorting unity. He has decided to leave managing the practical discussions on the finer points of policy to his Premier Gu Mengyu. As long as a masterful political operator like Wang remains at the helm, the Kuomintang will continue to pit their \"partners\" against one another."

 CHI.endgame.301.d: "Like a tree, the Party is a living organism - it must be nurtured and watered repeatedly so that the Party can perform its true functions and lead the masses to achieve a modern and democratic society. The Second Reorganisation of the Party led by the Reorganised Comrades Association has been successfully undertaken, with the bourgeoisie and degenerate elements of the party eliminated. Truly now, the Chairman can effectively run the party without interference from corrupt elements. While Wang has distanced himself from the RCA, it's clear that the RCA is dominated by those within its ranks who adhere to a more particular understanding of the sanminzhuyi. To them, history is materialistic; dare they might say that Dr. Sun's theory was grounded in materialism and that there is a sense of class within the semi-feudal world of China.\n\nThere exists little to no distinction between the RCA organisation and clique and the actual party of the Kuomintang as many aspects of RCA organisation and leadership have been passed by the Chairman at the encouragement of his premier, Chen Gongbo. Nicknamed the Chairman's \"right-hand\", some say the relationship between Chen and Wang lies in Chen's ambitions to influence the Kuomintang. Still, there is no denying Chen's absolute loyalty to the Chairman. Premier Chen has helped restore order throughout the country as the WMARCA has been thoroughly subdued, the CRS radicals purged, and Song Qingling has willingly resigned from politics and chosen a quiet retirement.\n\nAround the country, the young boys and girls of China read in their history books - the glorious deeds of China's great revolutionary heroes: Sun Yat-sen, Liao Zhongkai, Wang Jingwei, and of course, Chen Gongbo. Portraits of Sun and Wang grace every home and every classroom, and membership to the Youth Corps is glorified - with posters encouraging membership as a means of serving a new China. But there is also the concern that as the country grows richer due to state-capitalist policies, there will be a growing rising economic class in the near future. While the RCA has denied that such policies will lead to outright capitalism, only time will tell whether or not a complete socialist future awaits the Republic of China."

 CHI.endgame.302.d: "According to those close to him, one of Wang's favourite pastimes when he is not working long hours in his office at the Presidential Palace in Nanjing is to take long walks at the National Mausoleum. He is known to frequent the Mausoleum alone or with his youngest son; perhaps he reflects on how far the revolution has come - yet there is still so much work to be done.\n\nIt wasn't easy to come to this point. The Bonapartist Deng Yanda and his clique of reactionary officers sought to disrupt the national revolution; their cries for populism would have driven China into the pitfalls of anarchy, and the upstart bourgeois Sun Fo from Hawaii had returned just to stir up trouble within the Party. But it was neither Sun Fo's birthright nor Deng's. In the history of the Chinese National Revolution, there has been no one more loyal to the teachings and instructions of the late eternal premier Dr. Sun Yat-sen than Wang Jingwei. Was it not Wang who was present and wrote the late leader's Will? And was it not Wang, who led the Kuomintang to victory in the League War, the Expeditions of Unification, the Second Expedition, and the War of Resistance. \n\nHe could not have done it alone, however. The Chairman has always been surrounded by his closest followers, such as his beloved mentee Zeng Zhongming, his ever-faithful revolutionary comrade and wife Chen Bijun, and those such as Chu Minyi, Li Shiqun, and others within the Residence Faction. With the help of his circle, they have been able to rein in the radicalism of the RCA and also have saved the party from anti-revolutionaries.\n\nTo the Chairman, only the Party is necessary for bringing about the national revolution. And with his family in comfortable positions throughout the Party, there is little doubt that when the day comes for the Chairman to step down (or god forbid, pass away), the example of leadership set by the Chairman will carry on to his family members who will carry on the revolution.

 CHI.endgame.304.d: "In 1911, a revolutionary wave washed over the Chinese nation. The people rose up against their oppressive government, demanding democracy, the end of national humiliation, and for the government to fulfil its social obligations to them. For a bright, fleeting moment, the Xinhai revolutionaries were able to bring the old order crumbling down.\n\nThe events since then spelled doom however for this once hopeful movement. Republican groups failed time and time again across the 1910s and 1920s, often pitted against one another for influence in the south. Dr. Sun himself was unable to keep his unwieldy Constitutional Protection Movement together, with so many self-absorbed ideologues and selfish warlords willing to cut deals with the Beiyang usurpers rather than unite against oppression.\n\nChen Jiongming's betrayal in 1922 marked the turning point of the Kuomintang. It truly showed how alone the Kuomintang was - convincing Dr. Sun that only they could truly lead the way to a future uncorrupted by the stain of warlordism. Wang Jingwei was a major benefactor of the 1924 reorganisation and became a natural heir to the Eternal Premier's movement.\n\nBut Wang also went further than his revered master. He bravely went forth to extend a hand to republicans around the nation, successfully bridging what so many believed to be an impossible chasm between the Kuomintang and other Xinhai descended groups. With brilliant diplomatic skill, the grey eminence of the party healed the fissures that divided the nation to restore what was lost since 1911.\n\nThat is not to say he is some fool however, another dupe for the bandit strongmen that dominated the Warlord Era. With a proper army to keep order and the careful application of secret police work, he has kept the nation in line - lest they begin to destabilise the necessary tutelage needed to realise the Three Principles. In due time, the bourgeois parties that have been brought into the revolutionary fold will be taught these principles so that China may realise a truly national, democratic, and socialist future that the Wuchang martyrs died for."

He is no longer the dashing, young revolutionary he once was and the scars ache as his body shows its age. Still, the piles of reports never seem to end, and Wang has no intention of retiring anytime soon.\n\nSometimes though, he pauses for a moment to muse about what will happen after he's gone. Immediately afterwards, odds are it will be Premier Zeng Zhongming that takes his place, albeit with some challengers from other Wang proteges like Chen Gongbo and Zhou Fohai. Zeng is a generation younger than him, a little bit of a playboy but shaping up now. Nevertheless the Chairman likes to think ahead, to ensure the nation is steered wisely and his legacy - and indeed the legacy of Dr. Sun before him - is secure.\n\nThere is of course, the choice of his favourite and youngest son, Wang Wenti, who was born overseas in France and only ever saw China during the Central Committee's return. While he is still quite young and has years to grow, Wang Wenti has already picked up office work for his father and is reportedly eager to pursue a career in politics.\n\nThere is also his favourite daughter, Wang Wenxun who is currently serving as his secretary. But while Wang certainly has high aspirations for his daughter, the lingering effects of sexism may be a hindrance and burden to the young Wenxun.\n\nFinally there is also Ho Mang Hang, Wang's son-in-law, whom Wang has known since Ho was a child. A graduate of Jinling University with a degree in agriculture economics, Wang also sees in Ho as pupil that could potentially take his place as the Chairman of the Party.\n\nWang has not yet shared these thoughts with anyone, not even with his wife or Premier Zeng. Succession in the party is always difficult, as he can personally attest. Eventually, these matters will have to be resolved, but for now, all he can do is simply hope his successors will live in a better China than he did."

The coalition that had ousted Wang has proven too large and too unwieldy, and now that the Provisional Action Committee (now known as the Revolutionary Committee) has achieved dominance fears have multiplied that they will soon use their influence within the National Revolutionary Army as a cudgel against their political foes.\n\nSun Fo did not wait. This morning he \"fired the first shot\", presenting a proposal called \"An Outline of the Principles for Controlling Politics during the Period of Political Tutelage and the Methods of Handling Chinese Foreign Policy\". In it, he expressed optimism for the end of the military phase of the revolution but also condemned what he argued was the growing influence of the military in party affairs. Among many other articles, it also states that no active military officer may sit on the Central Executive Committee, nor can they serve as President of the Republic or Premier of any of the five yuans. Though most in the PAC would otherwise be amenable to such a proposal, the target was obvious: their champion General Deng Yanda.\n\nSun did not bother to wait for a response before going to the public with his demands: 1.) the end of Political Tutelage 2.) the reallocation of (primarily military) funding to national reconstruction 3.) the immediate drafting of a constitution. The last demand holds major symbolic importance - the Reconstruction Faction had insisted that a Constitution could not be implemented until after the completion of tutelage and would require the participation of other parties.\n\nSuch a demand effectively implies they are seeking the end of the party-state far earlier than previously forecasted. If granted, drafting would likely go through the Legislative Yuan, long a dumping ground for party exiles that seek sinecures and dominated by the RF. Intellectuals around the country have responded positively about Sun's demands, feeling emboldened to publicly condemn the party's dictatorship."

Many who failed to do so have hidden in their homes awaiting for a resolution as soldiers patrol the streets, themselves wondering what would happen next.\n\nIt seems that Sun Fo was not the only one having doubts about the new government, and multiple groups had agreed to coordinate opposition, but he made the first move either out of a desire to secure leadership or perhaps because of courage afforded by his \"untouchable\" status. In any case, the World Society moved next. Cai Yuanpei orchestrated the ouster of Song Qingling as President of the China League of Civil Rights, and the League has called for students to promote discourse against authoritarian rule. Not wanting to be outdone, the CSP-Orthodox have pressed their own demands, organising a strike by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.\n\nProtests have poured out into the streets, shaking the country once more as the young Republic struggles to find its footing.

Seeking the vulnerability of Song's Revolutionary Committee, they have pressed for greater amnesty for the defeated and compromises with the public. They have been joined by many former PAC members who have called on Song and Deng to take decisive action to alleviate tensions and promote dialogue.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many hardliners who point out that continuing to recklessly compromise with everyone will simply render the party unable to statisfy anyone. They have taken the form of extremists within the party, mostly CRS-aligned officers but plenty of WMARCA members have expressed these sentiments in private. This is not to say of course that many soldiers want further fighting - many officers have gone on record opposing a crackdown and many of the enlisted wish to go home soon."

 CHI.endgame.404.d: "There are few politicians as recognisable as Sun Fo, a fact that he has exploited to his fullest advantage. At no other point in his career has he had this much influence as he basks in the glory he has received casting himself as the defender of liberal democracy admist a socialist storm. His pretentions have made him difficult to negotiate in good faith with; many snidely remark that he seems to love the attention a little too much.\n\nHis latest lecture, delivered to cadets of the Central Training Corps is called \"Political Democracy and Economic Planning\". In it, he has decried how the Kuomintang has become too much of a separate caste, filled with haughty superiority and distant from the people. Any irony of such a speech being given by a man sitting atop an ivory tower his father built seems to have been lost on him.\n\nWhen finally sat down for another round of negotiations, he has thankfully offered some more concrete demands. For one, he insists on a \"one man, one post\" rule, ending the tendency for individuals in government and bureaucracy to hold multiple jobs at once. Furthermore, he has sought the confirmation of his close friend Liang Hancao as Premier of the Legislative Yuan, with himself as Premier of the Executive Yuan (serving concurrently as Vice Chairman of the Party) with control over several major portfolios. He has also called for major constitutional and democratic reforms, with a heavily liberal bent.\n\nNegotiators believe they can talk him down a little further from his far-reaching demands, particularly with cabinet posts and the duration of tutelage. But with the man soaking up the spotlight the way he is, it is clear that he is lining himself up to be the leading non-socialist candidate in future elections, likely dooming the revolution to a major split down the line.\n\nA more cynical option has been proposed - an envelop with certain \"useful\" information have made their way to President Song's desk. They include scandalous details about his continuing affair with socialite Lan Ni while his wife was recuperating from major illness. Combined with another affair with another woman twenty years his junior, keeping it secret from the public could be a useful bargaining chip in \"aggressive negotiations\"."

 CHI.endgame.405.t: "Divide et Impera"
 CHI.endgame.405.d: "The fundamental concept of political tutelage came about thanks to the recognition of the lack of genuine political consciousness among China's masses. The lower classes, while long suffering under the yoke of various oppressors, struggle to meaningfully identify the root causes of their torment - often merely lashing out at their direct masters without seeing the underlying causes of their servitude.\n\nIt is the Kuomintang's revolutionary duty to not merely protect the masses but also lead and educate them. The people need to be shielded from malcontents that can steer them astray, back to bourgeois oppression or to destructive radicalism. Various groups have sought to weaponise the population over the years, yet few have delivered anything but more war. Many simply yearn for stability and prosperity.\n\nThe Provisional Action Committee has always been sympathetic to the people's plight, including democracy. But such widescale adoption is simply not feasible for the near future, and the other two principles of the people's welfare and national interests must also be pursued concurrently. As the Gendarmerie is reinforced by various PAC aligned militias, many wonder how far they are willing to go to enforce it.\n\nThe outburst in popular enthusiasm stoked by the League of Chinese Syndicalists, while superficially a sign of strength, in many ways is a last gasp for a dying organisation. The League has continued to splint, with students, intellectuals, and bureaucrats forming the core of the World Society (and their China League of Civil Rights proxies), while workers, labourers, and soldiers are the popular base of the Chinese Syndicalist Party and their All-China Federation of Trade Unions.\n\nThe longer things go on, the more likely the protests will simply fizzle out. The World Society is likely to fold into the PAC cause anyway given many shared values, and the CSP are quick to clash with them. But for a shining moment of genuine enthusiasm, together they seem to have captured a certain desire among the people for syndicalist-aligned change. That is something President Song and her right-hand man Deng Yanda have considered when drafting their policies. As they prepare the nation for tutelage, they go forth..."

But these often goes both ways, and the General is just as much beholdened to his extensive civilian and military network as they are to him.\n\nThe differences between the RCA and PAC have always been muddled by the heavily intertwined networks. Sitting in the middle are a bloc often called the \"RCA-Moderates\" for their centrist positions, sometimes even rejecting class warfare. In many ways, they are even further right than both the PAC and RCA establishments, connected to the RCA mostly by such a personal connection to Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo.\n\nWith the two now out of the way, most are willing to be absorbed into the new \"Revolutionary Committee\", even if they have lingering concerns. Deng Yanda has been careful to seek out their opinions, sitting down with many such moderates to mend bridges. Although a military man by training, he has proven an adept peace-time statesman, reassuring frightened Kuomintang figures despite the fact that they have little choice but to hop aboard anyway.\n\nOn the other hand, the dividing line between moderate and radical in the party is never really clear, and there are plenty of those who continue to plot against President Song. One of the more common requests the General hears is for amnesty for various known subversives and hardline Wang loyalists. Evidently, their friends and family continue to plea their case even after their imprisonment/exile."

Radicalised to the point of derangement by their bitterness, and infused with vanguardist ideology from their disillusioned Western peers, many had risen to posts of prominence due to a mixture of their sheer audacity in combat and shady deals made by the PAC.\n\nNow however, with the violent portion of the revolution largely drawing to a close, they have been increasingly robbed of a sense of purpose. The Kuomintang are radical in many ways, and promise a wide-reaching revolution, but even these promises can hardly satiate their craving for total change.\n\nThey have taken ill to serving in a peace-time army, forced into a life of paper-work and menial guard duty over the derring-do they had been promised. Not that they have been particularly liked by the WMARCA military establishment, who disdain their \"Young Guard\" arrogance and find that their tendency towards terror tactics make them merely feared rather than generating much genuine affection. But with the WMARCA having consolidated control over the army, there is little chance for them to change tracks now.\n\nIf things stay their course, many expect that they will slowly, but painfully fade away into history. For now however, they have proven to be a thorn in the government's side as their influence continues to linger past their welcome. Their more heinous \"revolutionary\" crimes have thankfully gone down, but been replaced by petty ones often related to racketeering or common thuggery as young officers who missed the heroic parts of the revolution seek to \"prove themselves\".

After being called for a meeting, a sack was placed over his head and he was arrested, sent to an unknown destination where he has not been heard of since. In the meanwhile, Dai's men have broken into squabbling factions, further diluting their importance.\n\nDespite Dai's hated for the factionalism within the party, his agents have themselves often broken into provincial networks. He has not been above playing them against one another other, even as he stresses the need for \"jiafeng\" (family tradition). This often takes a literal dimension with his recruitment of his children, family, classmates, and fellow Zhejiangese into his agency's ranks. In particular, he has expressed a fondness for \"tough fellows of rivers and lakes\", drawn from the southern provinces (particularly Zhejiang, Hunan, and Guangdong).\n\nThese formed the basis of the now competing intelligence cliques. Mao Renfeng, Dai's childhood friend from Zhejiang has taken charge of the \"Zhejiang\" clique (and also the smaller, more intimate Jiangshan faction of men drawn from their home county). The Guangdong clique is the largest thanks to the party's historic connection to Guangdong. Led by Zheng Jiemin, they include many French trained agents. Tang Zong leads the smaller Hunan faction and include many British-trained agents. A neutral faction led by Wei Daming (the \"soul\" of Dai's operation, charged with communications) has also emerged.\n\nZheng has taken the initial advantage, but virtually nobody addresses him as \"Laoban\", a testament to the inadequacies of each of the successors without Dai. As Dai's lieutnants scheme against one another, the WMARCA has slowly taken away their prerogatives.

 CHI.endgame.440.d: "Feudalism has long been defined by political intellectuals and leaders within the Provisional Action Committee as the system in which the subsistence economy of China plays a dominant role in Chinese society. This system is one of inherent injustice as the landlords use political force to occupy the land and to exploit the peasants by plundering their products and forcing them to do free labour; in which the occupation of the land by landlords led to the total monopoly of political, military, and economic power. It is true that the coastal cities have already entered the capitalist stage but nonetheless, the backward northwestern, southwestern, and rural areas of China still belong to the feudal stage - feudalism is still the dominant force in China. Some of the PAC's own leaders themselves have originated from common backgrounds, such as General Deng Yanda. Since 70% of China's population are still bound to a feudal society, it is the role of the Party to step in and to liberate them from their archaic oppression.\n\nMost leaders in the PAC favour Dr. Sun Yat-sen's orthodox approach to \"Land to the Tiller\", which allows peasants to obtain their own land to till and that the government will take steps to eventually nationalise land gradually. The lands of warlords, local tyrants, corrupt officials, and evil gentry are to be confiscated and that land is not to be sold or bought in private. Those who work on the land rented from landlords should be allowed to have their rights over the land. To do this - will thus resolve the issue of land ownership without resigning the revolutionary process to excess populism.\n\nHowever, there are definitely those who question the idea of what constitutes the \"evil gentry.\" Among the military men and intellectuals within the PAC, there are those who come from landlord families who would find opposition to more radical land reforms - but there are certainly those within the PAC who believe that a much more radical land reform with aspects of a more violent social revolution is needed to fully end Feudalism's existence in China."

Instead, he has been made chairman of the United Front Work Department of the Central Executive Committee, a less prestigious position to be sure but integral to carrying out the party's ostensibly democratic promises.\n\nNon-Kuomintang republicans that were unable to join the LCS were often forced to participate as Dangwai (lit. \"outside of party\"). These independents were prevented from organising on any higher level, clipping their wings before they could meaningfully challenge the status quo. Their ranks have been allowed to increase as part of the agreement, allower greater representation from allied republicans.\n\nMore riveting is the inclusion of so-called \"Democratic Parties\" into the Legislative Yuan, with a preset number of seats allocated to them for the duration of the political tutelage. Required to acknowledge the dominace of the Kuomintang and swear by the Three Principles, they are expected to play a primarily advisory role. The bulk of them are small, intellectual and officially socialist groups, though a few of the more conventional, moderate parties have been included as well.\n\nZhang Junmai has cobbled together a \"Chinese Democratic League\", a collection of smaller social democratic, liberal, and other centre-left parties. With political momentum in the country shifting left-wards, the CDL has found themselves on the right-wing of the spectrum, forced to band together for relevance.\n\nThe Rural Reconstruction Association is a long-time Beiyang faction, previously operating under the auspices of the New Chinese Empire Reform Association. Not a formal party, their advocacy for rural reform and literacy programmes have made them politically palatable to the Revolutionary Committee.\n\nChina is a long way from democracy, even if on paper about a third of the Legislative Yuan are held by these \"Democratic Parties\".

However, following the Third National Congress and the consolidation of the Revolutionary Committee's hold on the Party, party leaders such as Deng Yanda are calling for a new form of Congress.\n\nFollowing the \"First United Front\" Policy from the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Deng has called for the continuation of the united front with the Chinese syndicalists and socialists to facilitate revolutionary change suitable for China - under the current political climate. In the context of these policies, PAC leaders have called for a People's Congress, a congress assembled of fellow socialists, including council communists, anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists, syndicalists, and other fringe socialist groups separate from the Kuomintang. Nonetheless, the PAC has firmly rejected the syndicalist leadership of the Party, and the People's Congress is still to be organised and led by the Kuomintang as the primary organ of the national revolution. \n\nThe Congress' first agenda was to follow a new reorganisation of the Kuomintang, a reorganisation of the Party into a party purely of workers and peasants (the workers and peasants shall make up 60% of the national bodies, while other occupational groups will form the remainder). Workers, peasants, women, and soldiers (representing the broad social groups of the national and social revolution), shall elect representatives to a hierarchy of assemblies and councils in order to exercise true power. Considered a resounding success, calls for a Second Peoples' Congress have been approved, and there is no doubt a second will follow in the coming years."

Instead, she has fused together the agrarian populists of the Provisional Action Committee, the anarchist idealists in the World Society, and the Moderates of the Revolutionary Comrades Association into one cohesive bloc, the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang.\n\nIn doing so, she has forged a party actually capable of delivering on its promises. One that stands for the oppressed commoners of China, giving them safety, stability, and prosperity. One that can drive out imperialists and beat back tyrants. One that can provide a genuine, socialist democracy from the humble cooperative upwards to the national government.\n\nIn this way, the RC-KMT claims to live up to the Three Principles set forth by its founder, in a dynamic and living manner of his eternal will. Some wonder however, if the RC-KMT is a little too united, held together by the strong hand of the state apparatus. As the political tutelage lumbers on, there have been some calls to loosen its grip to allow for fruitful discourse."

Dr. Sun truly grasped China's socio-political reality and helped revive the idea of Zhonghua by establishing a revolutionary party and army - he founded the very ideals that had helped secure the victory of the Second Northern Expedition. ]\n\nThis year, the Nationalist Government has officially granted a position of eternal honour to the late Premier of the Revolution by assigning him the name \"Guofu,\" meaning \"Father of the Nation.\" Through his endless revolutionary struggle, often marked with failure and exile, the revolution he inspired carried on - and in the end, has fully unified and freed China after decades of strife.\n\nHaving died before the Northern Expedition commenced, Sun's corpse lay in the Western Hills of [GetVictoryPointName_9843] for years. However, following the Second Northern Expedition's success, his body was properly returned to Nanjing to rest. The Nationalist government has commissioned the architect's Lu Yanzhi and Huang Tanpu to commission building a mausoleum to honour Sun forever. This majestic project combines traditional styles of imperial tombs and modern architecture, along with a tri-arched gate inscribed with Dr. Sun's quote, \"What is under Heaven belongs to all.\" A sacrificial hall is to be built with the ceiling painted with the glorious flag of the Kuomintang while Sun's body lies interned - guarded forevermore by ever-present armed guards; his memory and legacy will be treasured for generations to come."

Former PAC members and syndicalists have proposed to the Legislative Yuan of the Party to adopt a new national flag, one that brings honour to the peasants with a characterstic plow added to the Wholly Red Earth. There have been others however, who have proposed that the new Flag of the Republic should incorporate elements for both the workers and peasants. Indeed as the PAC had championed the cause for all oppressed peoples, the new flag should depict the workers and the peasants by incorporating the plow and a symbol of a cog together.

For years, the two have been rather separate cliques within the NRA - with the India Clique being those officers that resided and trained in India, while the latter was fighting the guerrilla war in the MinGan Insurgency. There are certainly stronger socialist sympathies within the leadership of the WMARCA while the socialist tendencies of the India Clique are vague at best, and they are most adequately described as nationalists above all.\n\nNonetheless, the two factions certainly hold a shared history in the Fourth Army (Guangdong Army) of the National Revolutionary Army's first Northern Expedition. They were comrades once before, and then they were comrades once more in the Second Northern Expedition. As the WMARCA continues to consolidate its grasp and hold over Whampoa's students and loyalty - there are private reports that generals such as Xue Yue and Zhang Fakui believe that they find themselves increasing marginalised. With the military phase of the revolution concluded, there begs the question on whether or not ensuring the loyalty of the India Clique even matters - nonetheless, older members of the WMARCA have vouched for these generals due to their long standing shared comradery in the national revolution."

This trend led them to be viewed by suspicion by more conservative military members, especially during the Crisis of the Third Congress, as they are believed to find Marx more alluring instead of the Three Principles' of the People.\n\nThe Nationalist Government, in its bid for legitimacy and as well as to finally conclude the arduous process of national unification, as in effect - granted amnesty to all those lower-ranking officers and soldiers who had rebelled against the Central Government. Nonetheless, many of those who opposed us have become disheartened in the revolutionary cause and feel as if their career prospects have been severely harmed due to their past affiliation.

The Political Department was a hotbed of revolutionary activity, its cadre was made up of intellectuals and officers from the League of Chinese Syndicalists and has often been associated as one of Whampoa's most socialist-leaning wings.\n\nThe victory of the Provisional Action Committee has led to a reassessment on the nature of the Political Department. General Zhang Zhizhong has taken full responsibility for the department's alignment during the unrest against the rightful Nationalist Government and has since offered his promise that the Political Department shall henceforth remain loyal to the Revolutionary Committee. General Deng Yanda has ordered a complete curriculum change for the Political Department, ordering instructors to stress the idea of \"union of all revolutionary classes\" while also reorienting the department to focus on Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People exclusively.

Madame Sun Yat-sen, Song Qingling, found herself moved to tears at seeing the masses march in their rags to experience in the pursuit of national salvation. Indeed the late eternal premier remarked that the revolution's success begins with the people; the revolution is part of their duty to achieve liberation.\n\nMany years later, the National Revolution has reached its concluding stages. The Orthodox Faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party dominated the policy of the United Front with the League of Chinese Syndicalists. This alliance, the cooperation with the European syndicalists, has led to the victory of the Chinese Revolution - none can stop the advance of the workers and peasants. Despite this, the country is still effectively under the control of the Kuomintang - the KMT organises unions and associations, and the KMT is the elder sister in the relationship between the two parties. It remains to be seen whether or not this relationship will continue as it is now, whether or not the Chinese Syndicalists will gradually find themselves absorbed into the larger KMT, or if the KMT shall continue to see more of its principles diluted by the allure of syndicalism.\n\nNonetheless, there is much to rejoice in the coming years. Long have the workers and peasants toiled and suffered by the establishment of capitalism, the imperialistic institution that has divided the country and brought it to ruin. With the Revolutionary Committee in charge, a committee made up of representatives of workers and peasants - never again shall capitalism emerge in China.

As written by the esteemed Li Shizeng, there are revolutions that propel the course of human history: the monarchial revolution of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties that established the notion of order, the national revolutions of democracy as shown by the American and French Revolutions, and the socialist revolutions of which evidence of its success can be seen in the Commune of France and the Union of Britian. The KMT has successfully moved China through the stages of the national and socialist revolutions and now the country is ready for the fourth revolution - that is the revolution to pursue datong.\n\nThe utopians of the KMT believe that there is indeed a world free of strife and pain. Hate and anger divide unity and it is only by the power and guidance of the Party, that we may see a society free of such divisions - a society of pure love. The Revolutionary Committee of the KMT has taken steps to embrace this libertarian dream, power is to be decentralised to local authorities, workers and peasants are encouraged to organise themselves into democratic units or regional councils, and there is to be an emphasis on decentralising central power. These ideals are believed to encompass the values and dreams of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who pursued the idea that the people of China could be taught and learned their basic rights and for democracy to flourish eventually.\n\nThe anarchists however would tell you that there is no telling when that day comes. Some remark optimistically that it may take over 3,000 years to reach this state of anarchy - that each progressive stage of human history may take decades and even centuries to achieve its results. The idea of such an anarchist federation within the KMT is flexible and acknowledges that such a revolution takes time and patience, that the Party will guide the peoples to total liberation.

The party came and tried to throw off these opportunists, only to be stabbed in the back by concessionist traitors and German imperialists.\n\nLast came Wang and his RCA, who claimed to be fighting for the people but instead allowed the plague of corruption to continue, smearing themselves with the same shameful, double-dealing grime that has defined modern Chinese politics. Thanks to the brave comrades of the PAC, Song Qingling and Deng Yanda have successfuly driven out the last of unscrupulous from the halls of power.\n\nInstead, they have opened up a new era of idealism, cleaning up the corruption that once permeated the capital and bringing the Republic closer to the people.

Before Sun Yat-sen was betrayed by Yuan Shikai, and then the warlords, and then the red imperialists of the Internationale. Wang Jingwei and the syndicalists perverted his vision, or so the new party-line says.\n\nSong Qingling and Sun Fo, two of the people closest to him, claim to have brought the party back to what it should have been, a left-leaning democratic party working for the good the nation. The latter, in particular, seems to be quixotically trying to turn back the clock to before 1924, before the reorganisation and the party's leftwards turn. In many ways he has sought to rewrite history, ignoring many of the developments that have occurred in the ensuing decades.\n\nThere are many lingering differences between the pair, hardly two years apart from one another in age. Song believes she has set the nation on a fundamentally socialist trajectory, bringing the nation closer to a socialist, democratic ideal built around local peasant communes. The self-serving bourgeois parties Sun has invited in are simply a necessary evil, that with any luck will be molded to actually serve the people.\n\nTo Sun Fo, the revolution his father wanted can still be salvaged, if only he can get the constitution right. It has already gone through several stages of drafting, first under his personal oversight, then with a \"People's Political Council\" helping him, and now the multiparty \"Political Consultative Council\". He hopes to dampen the socialist radicalism to build a parliamentary republic - moving power away from the Executive to Legislature.\n\nHe has also made moves to strengthen the Premiership of the Executive Yuan at the expense of the Presidency, the first of what will likely be a long series of political battles between Dr. Sun's heirs. Despite this, some dare to hope that these fights will not be resolved by more violence, but will instead translate to a peaceful adaptation of a multiplural system at the end of the tutelage.

Cities such as Xiamen and Longyan lie brutally destroyed and ravaged with Provisional Action Committee guerrillas having made a desperate last stand in Longyan. Much of what the MinGan Government had built lies in destruction and Blueshirt militias have gotten to work - handling the surrender of remaining insurgents. In a report sent back to the high command under now Generalissimo Hu Zongnan, General Deng Wenyi relayed to the capital that the region is effectively \"pacified.\"\n\nWith the ashes still burning hot and the embers smouldering, the China Revival Society seems poised to secure the rest of the country. Nonetheless, the traitorous Generals Deng Yanda and Zhou Enlai have yet to be found and are presumed to be alive, most likely organising further resistance towards the leadership of the CRS. There is also the issue and threat of further insurgent cells aligned to the PAC, the RCA, and even the CSP in major cities and rural areas around the country.\n\nThankfully, with the former members of the RCA and PAC so bitterly divided against one another, it seems unlikely they will band together in a meaningful capacity. If anything, the former factions have grown more divided, splintering into hardened, paranoid rebel cells under local personalities. Despite this, unrest continues and it is clear to the Generalissimo and to the leadership of the CRS, that pacification is yet still fully to be achieved."

 CHI.endgame.602.d: "As the pacification campaigns rage on and the China Revival Society struggles to uphold what little legitimacy it has to the leadership of the Kuomintang and of the Chinese nation - greater troubles abound the Republic, as the nation's economy is utterly in ruins. Large urban centres and parts of the countryside lay in devastation due to the civil war and the country's economic growth - which was perceived to be on the rise after unification - has effectively halted.\n\nTo make matters worse it seems that foreign trade, even with the Third Internationale, has largely stopped due to the open xenophobia and nationalistic rhetoric of the CRS. The violence of the CRS, especially regarding their anti-imperialistic and anti-foreign outlook, has led many foreigners to simply leave China and any potential investments from foreign countries seem unlikely. Foreign bankers and investors have liquidated their investments nearly overnight upon the victory of the CRS. Furthermore, many wealthy Chinese expatriates in places such as Southeast Asia and Hawaii have also withdrawn their support for the Party - with many denouncing Hu Zongnan's coup of the government as unlawful and lamenting the Party's division.\n\nWith the economy returning to League War levels of devastation and stagnation, it is unlikely that China's economy will be able to recover quickly. The storm clouds have gathered over China, and the country grows restless even further; if the CRS are to indeed hold on to their claims of Chinese leadership - then they must act quickly in resolving the economic crisis."

Sure, his father had authoritarian tendencies, but he did not leave the sanctuary of the Hawaiian islands to partake in the idealistic Second Northern Expedition only to see it collapse to the excesses of totalitarianism and tyranny. While he is still de facto Premier of the Executive Yuan, what difference does that make now that the National Revolutionary Army controls all parliamentary and civilian affairs?\n\nOfficially, the Reconstruction Faction still controls the Legislative Yuan and other civilian organs of the government. But this does not matter much as the entire Party's direction and military operations are entirely in the hands of Hu Zongnan and his followers. Under the direction of Hu, a state of emergency is still to be maintained indefinitely. The Legislative Yuan has been indefinitely suspended - further adding to the uncertainty of the Party's future.\n\nOfficially the China Revival Society does seek to uphold Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People (one of which is Minquan, the People's Rights/Democracy). But plenty of CRS radicals such as He Zhonghan who believe that democracy simply has no place in a modern society. To them, democracy is a poison that stains the Party's lifeline and is a degenerative disease upon the Party. He Zhonghan views the Legislative Yuan as inherently bourgeois and seeks to abolish it, and indeed much of the bureaucratic apparatus that allows the government to run.\n\nAlmost every day now, He Zhonghan and Sun Fo clash in Generalissimo Hu's office, jostling over the fate of the suspended legislature. Although it would be a powerless rubber-stampping committee even if it did reopen, it still would still slow down the worst excesses of the new regime and is therefore poses a threat to He Zhonghan's wild ambitions.

 CHI.endgame.621.d: "Gannan, in the south of Jiangxi Province, was one of the major regions of unrest during the Kuomintang Civil War due to its location being one of the core areas of the MinGan Populist Government. The province has long been rather rural and poor, with popular vices such as opium smoking and prostitution still being popular among the locals.\n\nOne particular commissar sent south to pacify the region has received a name for himself. Chiang Ching-Kuo, the son of the former headmaster of the Whampoa Military Academy, has received great acclaim in the newspapers and journals of CRS for his work in pacifying the local population. The headmaster's son had fled alongside many other Kuomintang exiles during the collapse of the Northern Expedition and found himself in the circles of Hu Zongnan and He Zhonghan in Europe. Upon his return to China, he has found himself further entrenched in the China Revival Society, in which he has received his latest post.\n\nIn Gannan, Chiang has studied government management and has created a local \"public information desk\", where locals could visit him with their problems. He has administered harsh penalties for opium smoking, gambling, and prostitution per the doctrine of morality that the CRS espouses to. Regarding the ban on prostitutes and brothels, Chiang has created a programme where former prostitutes can find employment in factories.\n\nIn addition, Chiang has also created a Chinese Children's Village for orphans created by both the civil war and War of Resistance. This village, created on the outskirts of Ganzhou, features facilities such as a nursery, kindergarten, primary school, hospital, and gymnasium - although the training of the schools and gymnasiums emphasise the martial spirit of the CRS' ideology."

Young children are to be given guns and warships as toys, and pictures of battle scenes would be placed on the walls \"so that from childhood, children would develop an interest in military equipment and battle situations.\" From kindergarten onwards, children are to be educated in a military environment, with middle school students enrolling in the Three Principles of the People Youth League (which is the sole youth organisation), with a strong martial emphasis. Stress is placed on physical training and group competitions - in this way, the frail and bookish students of the past are to be replaced by the revolutionary vanguard of the future.\n\nFormal military education is to begin in secondary school, in which men could partake in military training while the girls would receive training as nurses. Studies in the humanities would be discouraged, while practical and scientific subjects such as physics, chemistry, and engineering are to be oriented toward their wartime applications. For example, classes in chemistry will stress the study of things such as poison gases and explosives."

 CHI.endgame.623.t: "The New Life Movement"
 CHI.endgame.623.d: "The China Revival Society seeks to revive culture that is true Chinese culture. The events of the Third National Congress and the Kuomintang Civil War showed the disintegration of national culture. Thus it is imperative that a Cultural Revolution be implemented to revive the national culture and to revitalise the soul of the nation. They do not wish to reject Western modernisation but rather regard the village traditions of self-satisfaction, individualism, passivity, and superstition are unsuitable for the \"scientific age\". While the four traditions of li, yi, lian, and chi were eternally valid (the four cardinal principles of Confucianism), the CRS seeks to rectify everything wrong with \"old culture.\"\n\nThis is not a spontaneous movement but perhaps something that resonates deeply with the Generalissimo Hu Zongnan. Hu, who spent many years in exile in the Union of Britain, bas frequently linked the Whampoa cadets to that of the \"roundheads\" - and compares himself with Oliver Cromwell, a strong Republican military leader to rally the masses. He sees his personal life style of abstaining from one of vices as one the masses should emulate and the CRS itself is divided on whether or not to draw inspiration from the character of the Lingxiu or to tap more into the revolutionary nature of a cultural revolution.\n\nThe New Life Movement was launched at the behest of the Generalissimo as a revolution against reactionary liberalism and reactionary culture.  Western liberal books are banned as they are seen as encouraging decadence and lust. At the encouragement of RACA commissars, CRS members host large rallies in which foreign books are burned and denounced as foreign and Western immorality. Public smoking and spitting on the streets have been banned as they are seen as culturally and morally backward, while even perming one's hair is subject to a fine - as hair should be straight. Even relatively benign acts such as jaywalking are forbidden to encourage the image that China is indeed a modern nation that uses roads.\n\nNanchang, nicknamed one of the birthplaces of the revolution due to the fighting during the League War, is to serve as a new example of this new modern and moral China. Prostitutes and beggars have been driven off the streets and drug addicts, sent to \"rehabilitation.\" New buildings are erected on the sites of ruined and dilapidated houses, streets are widened, and a number of new parks and schools have been opened to entertain and educate the people."

 CHI.endgame.624.d: "Dusk falls over the old Kuomintang, as an era comes to an end. The old order with its warlords and Emperors is long gone, thrown down by a second wave of triumphant revolutionaries. But many of those same revolutionary dreamers whose voices were once so powerful are not so anymore. The leaders who were poised to rule the nation now find themselves languishing on the sideline (or worse) as a new generation of revolutionary leadership takes the helm.\n\nWang Jingwei's clique is mostly gone, with the Reorganised Comrades Association banned as subversive. His followers have scattered to the winds, with Chen Gongbo fleeing into exile. His once mighty opposition has similarly dissolved under the weight of persecution. Song Qingling has not been seen in public in many weeks, placed under house arrest weeks ago. She officially is a board member for multiple charities often in her husband's name, though in practice lives a life of quiet solitude. Deng has never been found, it's unclear if he's still alive, but hope his underground resistance would come to anything has dimmed. Any hope for a successful United Front has died with them, and the feuding cliques of the League of Chinese Syndicalists has similarly fled - blaming one another on the way out.\n\nSun Fo seems to be the only one left standing, even as most of his wealthy followers have cut their losses and either shifted loyalty to the Generalissimo or gone abroad into hiding. The Premier of the Executive Yuan, his power has become increasingly titular - shrinking in face of the advancing Revolutionary Army Comrades Association (RACA). He Zhonghan, the leader of this (even more radical) wing of the CRS, has sought to gut the bureaucracy - inspired by the Sorelians' revolutionary teachings of an accidental vanguard. In his heated meetings with General Hu, Sun fights tooth and nail, insisting his father's words remain paramount even in this new era."

 CHI.endgame.625.d: "While their public front is the China Revival Society, members of the much more closeted movement of He Zhonghan's  Revolutionary Army Comrades Association (RACA), a military clique popular amongst radical Whampoa students, are responsible for the training and indoctrination of the CRS. With comparisons given to them as a fraternal organisation akin to the Reorganised Comrades Association and the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association, the RACA indeed follows a much more esoteric method of organisation and secrecy.\n\nIn fact, the most spectacular of their rituals is the initiation ceremony into RACA itself. Prospective RACA members can only achieve membership through the recommendation of older members and are instructed to learn the society's secret signs and esoteric language. At the ceremony, candidates vowed to keep the secrets of the fraternity and then read oaths from a paper which is then burned and mixed into a bowl of chicken blood, tinted with wine and sugar. New pledges then became blood brothers by squeezing some of their blood into the bowl and drinking from it. These ceremonies are accompanied by secret body and hand signals as well as a secret dance, which is a means by which the rank and file and officers identify each other.\n\nCertainly, there are reservations about these superstitious and triad-esque rituals performed by the RCA. After all such measures seem childish and with the CRS having achieved leadership of the power, is there really need for such secrecy in the movement? But there is no doubt that the fraternal organisation of the RACA is indeed quite popular amongst the new and established officers of Whampoa, and if the Generalissimo is to crack down on them - may lead to unrest amongst the followers of He Zhonghan."

 CHI.endgame.626.t: "Internal Factions of the CRS"
 CHI.endgame.626.d: "Despite their hatred for government bureaucracy and factionalism, the China Revival Society is made up of three major \"rings\", each ring progressively smaller than the last and representing different levels of power within the political hierarchy.\n\nThe inner circle is the Lixingshe consisting of 528 members and is considered to be the new Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. The inner circle does not even identify itself as the CRS, but rather, the CRS is a public front for the operations of the Society. Their discussions and methods are almost entirely private and secretive, although they are led by the Executive Secretary, He Zhonghan. To supervise the decision-making of policies and operations, the inner circle is assisted by a secretariat (Deng Wenyi) and by four separate functional departments, namely the General Affairs (Liu Butong), Propaganda (Kang Ze), Organisation (Zheng Jiemin), and Special Services (Dai Chunfeng).\n\nThe second ring of the concentric circles is He Zhonghan's Revolutionary Army Comrades Association (RACA), based around the graduates of Whampoa Military Academy. While they are sometimes mistaken as the actual CRS, the RACA is in charge of planting new cells and is in charge of infiltrating the civilian populace, bureaucracy, and military to raise membership for the CRS.\n\nThe final and third ring is also the largest and is the face of the political aspects of the CRS - acting as the organisation's mass base. The Fuxingshe or China Revival Societyhe lowest level of the organisation; but is also organised into four departments. However, they have no outright leadership of their own, with all matters being handled by the RACA. Orgnaised in the similar committee system of the Kuomintang, debate was admitted at lower levels, but decisions were made at the top. Furthermore, the CRS even has a supervisory system and a control commission to check and control the Fuxingshe - while also keeping watch over individual member's thoughts, behaviour, and actions, to ensure that they are loyal to the national revolution. This control group numbers over one thousand people, with its top a supervisory committee with an executive secretary at its head, with the control group further splitting into branch and sub-branch levels to maintain control over the overall strength and unity of the Party."

 CHI.endgame.627.d: "For many people both in the party and outside of it, General Chiang Kai-shek was a well-meaning failure at best and a reactionary bonapartist at worst, his legacy sundered by the failure of the Northern Expedition and the rise of his leftist political rivals. After his assassination in 1927, few had much good to say about the former Headmaster of Whampoa in public, if anything.\n\nThis all changed with the rise of the China Revival Society, who has rehabilitated their former teacher's reputation as a disgrace, elevating him to new heights in the revolutionary pantheon. Almost overnight, state media which had previously made reticent acknowledgements of Chiang's role at most have changed their tune. Chiang has been cast as a heroic figure and dashing commander who trained a generation of revolutionaries before being betrayed by a conniving Wang Jingwei and murdered by wicked reactionaries. Chiang has become a symbol for the military, the model soldier and comrade. His personal foibles have receded into the annals of history, replaced by a nigh-mythical stature.\n\nAll of this of course serves not only a personal but also a practical one. For many of the young cadets turned national leaders who never knew Sun Yat-sen personally, Chiang Kai-shek serves as a bridge between the Eternal Premier's legacy and their own - consolidating their claim to legitimacy. But there is little doubt that there is a genuine element of loyalty involved as well given the old Whampoa Headmaster's fondness for his students, one that has been since returned. Chiang's legacy has become a fixture in Hu Zongnan's own cult of personality as the regime builds new heroes and legends."

 CHI.endgame.628.d: "The National Revolutionary Army has always been fraternal in mindset, with deeply entrenched bonds of personal loyalty fortified by a shared ideological zeal. These powerful networks of social ties, often transcending party factionalisation, was torn apart when the fallout of the Third Repatriated Congress pit units and officers harshly against one another. This has threatened to tear out the heart of what was once a mighty victorious army, which repelled foes larger, better equipped, and even better led by the might of its shared, stubborn revolutionary will-power.\n\nNow, with Nanjing loyalist National Revolutionary Army units and Blueshirt paramilitaries barely able to keep order, there have been a heightened interest within the new government for limited mass-amnesty programmes for select units, lest the army be at an advantage in taking on foreign opponents. Within the military doctrinal divide, the CRS was always identified as a part of the broader \"Young Guard\" umbrella, trained extensively in foreign technologies in Europe. This has made Generals He Zhonghan and Deng Wenyi more willing to forgive members of the Political Department clique, now led by Zhang Zhizhong. Although Zhou Enlai is at large, some members of Dai Chunfeng's rivals in the Red Squad have acquiesced to returning to the fold.\n\nThe \"Old Guard\" of the military however is far more relevant and continues to carry on much of the prestige of the now mythologised MinGan insurgency and shares a heavy connection with Whampoa alumni fraternities. Thanks to the lobbying of members of the India Clique and also Lin Biao, a MinGan commander turned influential CRS leader, it is believed with the right words they can sway many of Lin's old MinGan colleagues into siding with the new government.\n\nIn both cases however, there remains a question about how much \"old mindsets\" can change, and whether or not they can be truly forgiven for their lack of vision. Perhaps the truly revolutionary thing to do would be to promote a new generation of military officers more aligned with the Generalissimo's goals."

The NRA needs to, however, thoroughly examine its ranks to gage which officers could potentially be willing followers of the new regime - or which officers seek to bring its downfall. If anything some of these officers are even a liability as not all of the officers in our employment may necessarily be former Whampoa alumni.\n\nThere is also the question of the India Clique. While they participated in the Northern Expedition, they have often been known to take sides with Sun Fo and his Reconstruction Faction.

But life continued to go on, even in the darkest times and places. And now that the worst of the fighting has ceased, there has been room for happier moments as the people can finally see a future free of violence over the horizon.\n\nHu Zongnan, it seems, is one of those people. After the collapse of the Northern Expedition, Hu Zongnan vowed he would not marry until after national liberation, a promise he finally kept today in a grand wedding celebration with his beautiful young fiancee. His bride, Ye Xiadi is a fellow former teacher-turned-revolutionary from Zhejiang who became an officer in the Juntong, serving as one of Dai's secretaries. The pair were introduced to each other by Dai Chunfeng and became secretly engaged, a fact hidden until very recently.\n\nPlenty of other families have celebrated unification with weddings and children of their own, even as the dead continue to be buried. For all the trauma the Chinese people have experienced, the cycle of birth, life, and death continues on.

At the very top of the chain of command sits Hu Zongnan, and beneath him are a more personal circle within the Lixingshe dubbed the \"Thirteen Taibao\" (a nickname derived from Chinese folklore). These men are some of Hu's most loyal supporters and proteges, and far exceeding Sun Fo, the official premier, in influence. The Generalissimo's left and right hands are He Zhonghan and Dai Chunfeng, each embodying vastly different wings of Hu's supporters.\n\nHe Zhonghan is an ideologue at heart, born to a gentry family. A former Marxist, syndicalist, and propagandist, he was an associate with Dong Biwu before studying abroad in France. A more worldly officer with roots as a middle school teacher, he holds vast ideological ambitions, hoping to refine his beliefs into a comprehensive, totalitarian socialist programme for his nation to follow.\n\nDai Chunfeng was born to a poor but determined single-mother. He spent his youth getting into fights, gambling, and also briefly studying to be a teacher. A brilliant student despite a limited conventional education, his nationalism often takes inspiration from Chinese classics and the various heroes and myths that populated them. His spent life \"living off the land\" before joining the party, and he is far less ideological than those who could flee abroad to Europe in 1927. That said, what he lacks in ideological refinement he well makes up for in dogged loyalty. His preferred name, Dai Li (lit. to wear a rain hat) figuratively indicates a servant status for his master.\n\nThe two men were born almost worlds apart in the old order, but were united by the revolution, the Whampoa spirit, and service to Hu Zongnan. Another teacher by education, but of a more humble stock, he nonetheless had his start in politics as a minor newspaper editor. He often mediates the increasing clashes between the two major wings of his party, particularly over questions of idealistic revolution, cynical patronage, personal brotherhood and national interests. Hu has leveraged his older age and his closer connection to Chiang Kai-shek to become the undisputed leader of the China Revival Society, and even now as his Taibao fight there is little question who they ultimately serve."

 CHI.endgame.632.d: "While the Blueshirts of the China Revival Society are nominally unified in their desire for national economic reforms under the direction of national socialism, interestingly enough the CRS finds itself rather divided on the issue of land reform.\n\nLand reform moderates (which includes most in the Lixingshe/Central Executive Committee who are not involved with the Revolutionary Army Comrades Associaton) advocate mass industrialisation as a means of modernising agriculture. They are inspired by the machine tractor systems proposed by Savinkovists in [RUS.GetNameDef] and seek to create a similar manner in China. However, they oppose total land nationalisation -as they believe that the system of privat eland holding had resulted from an evolution of history, and to overthrow such a system would exacerbate rural disorder. Instead they advocate for a reduction of taxes and rents, the total elimination of corrupt bureaucrats, and the improvement of transportation and agricultural facilities and techniques for the peasants. It therefore, seeks to follow Dr. Sun's principle of land to the tiller, requiring that farm owners should sell only land in excess of nine acres and in exchange would receive government bonds.\n\nHe Zhonghan and his Revolutionary Army Comrades Association, however advocate for a much more radical land reform. They demand the total nationalisation of land and the organisation of production by state-managed agricultural collectives. To them, simply redistributing land to the farmers, would perpetuate the cultural statins of economic individualism. By creating a system of large-scale, rationalised production on state-owned agricultural collectives, the introduction of improved farm technology would be facilitated, as would the accumulation and reinvestment of the farm surplus. The creation of these farm plots, with the help of machine tractor stations and other means of machinery, would create the industrialisation of agriculture.\n\nBy advocating this method of nationalisation and collectivisation, the RACA knowingly commits ideological heresy by challenging the teachings of the late leader, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The RACA has answered that Sun never stated whether the ultimate land system would be based upon private or national ownership - just as a means of attaining equal rights which would naturally happen due to RACA's total nationalisation of land."

For many young officers muckraking the thoroughly corrupt Chinese bureaucracy is their chance at a career-making breakthrough.\n\nPerhaps that is why they became too bold, underestimating just how entrenched post-revolutionary interests already are. In the recently seized north, General Ma Hansan has carved out his domain as the director of the north China region for Dai Chunfeng's Juntong. Using his extensive connections and his northern background (90% of the Juntong are southerners), he has been counted as the \"fifth\" of the Juntong's \"four great generals of the north\" (the others being Wang Tianmu, Liu Yizhou, Qiao Jiacai, and Chen Gongshu).\n\nNot a Whampoa graduate, he was an outsider to the intra-Juntong rivalries between Mao Renfang's Zhejiang branch, Zheng Jiemin Guangdong branch, Tang Zong's Hunan branch, and Wei Daming's clique. Consequently, he was happy to maintain his own \"neutral\" clique, boasting that Juntong agents are \"three levels above any civilian official\". His men have been extorting money from \"traitors\", collecting \"work fees\", embezzling seized property and even selling false Juntong work permits to reactionaries to help them escape justice.\n\nThis blatant corruption and other irregularies have made him an easy target for the swarming commissars unleashed by General He. Ma has been publicly arrested (probably thanks to tips from jealous rivals) in case trumpeted by He Zhonghan's allies. Emboldened by these successes, He Zhonghan has struck out against his own rival Dai Chunfeng, trying his luck arresting dozens of Shanghai gangsters and other \"patriotic\" businessmen protected by the embarrassed Juntong.\n\nThe \"Laoban\" of the new Republic's premier secret police has exploded with his legendary temper, and has demanded the prompt release of those \"unjustly imprisoned.\" He has appealed directly to Generalissimo Hu, insisting that policing belongs in his jurisdiction.

But to the China Revival Society, the burning of scholars and books by the first Qin emperor, while tragic, was considered necessary to lay the groundwork for the Chinese state. It was the Qin Emperor who build foundation for the Chinese state after years of sporadic infighting and instability, and it was the Generalissimo who revived the Republic after the Civil War. By any means necessary the ideals of Dr. Sun Yat-sen must be upheld and that must be the case even if this means sacrificing one's life and liberty.\n\nThere is no questioning that Hu Zongnan is the indisputable leader of China and the only one capable of leading the Chinese people to salvation.

Just as revolutionaries in the Tongmenghui and the Kuomintang pledged their lives and happiness to the late leader Dr. Sun Yat-sen, so should we pledge ourselves to our leader. Thus for the first time, yes - we do call ourselves totalists in accordance with the vanguardist charter. Until there is a total revolution, unless there is total obedience to the leader, we cannot achieve freedom or liberty from the chains of imperialism!"

 CHI.endgame.702.d: "During the first class of Whampoa, there was no other candidate that stood out than the brilliant He Zhonghan. A revolutionary and proud nationalist, he had seen Germany's role in China's humiliation and vowed that never again; never again should the Chinese people suffer under the weight of imperialism.\n\nIt was He Zhonghan who was one of the first to organise the China Revival Society from a fringe movement to a disciplined and orderly organisation. Under him, the Revolutionary Army Comrades Association was created for soldiers in the Whampoa Military Academy to grow together, to work together, to fight together, and to share the burdens of the national revolution. But it was also He's own writings that European totalism imbued the spirit of Dr. Sun's Revolution and only through such totalitarian means could the country be saved.\n\nTo say that He Zhonghan advocates for an authoritarian state is an understatement as he advocates for a completely unabashedly totalitarian state. As the Executive Secretary of the Lixingshe, he has passed numerous laws that forbid any seditious activity from journalists and that all newspapers must be censored and run through the state. Only under such control, can the masses learn - can they learn that our means of revolution is correct. Furthermore, all information that goes through to the Generalissimo must pass through He first; leading to resentment amongst some members of CRS who wonder who is really in charge.\n\nOur country is one of dreamers, and He's dreams of China are slowly but quickly becoming a reality. The Executive Secretary yearns for a day when tutelage does not need to be practiced and when the people themselves can control the masses. With their new cultural patterns, taught to them by the RACA and CRS, theywould be able to control dissenting minorities and to truly practice minquan - truly work towards the social and national revolution."

 CHI.endgame.801.d: "The dust settles, and the guns have fallen silent across China as the Kuomintang Civil War has finally concluded. The Provisional Action Committee is broken, many of its leaders having either fled into exile or killed in battle - with General Deng Yanda missing (rumours have it that he has fled for Europe or for the Legation Cities). Song Qingling has peacefully surrendered but she has been \"encouraged\" to take a break from national politics indefinitely.\n\nThe Chinese Nationalist Party or Kuomintang, has long been regarded as the sole revolutionary body in China, the only party capable of liberating China from imperialism and overcoming years of political instability in the form of warlordism. Truly, Dr. Sun Yat-sen is world renowned for his efforts in organising the Chinese Revolution against the Qing and is well respected for his ideals of democracy, welfare, and nationalism. Respected throughout the nation and externally for their revolutionary goals - the Kuomintang's reputation has since fallen short due to their brutal civil war. The Party's reputation lies in tatters and some observers even remark that a period of warlordism is likely to return to the country.\n\nNow Chen Gongbo, the Premier of the Republic of China, is determined to rebuild order and to revive the Party's image. But to do so, the party must be first reorganised - it must be purified even if this process takes violence, requires blood... the Party needs to be reformed. Dreams stay as dreams unless someone acts upon them. For Chen, he is fully determined to make these dreams become reality."

The industry of Jinling as well as the natural resources of Anhui, were used to fulfill the needs of the growing National Revolutionary Government and the NRA.\n\nDuring the Civil War of the Party, much of the infrastructure and industry of China's eastern coast were damaged or utilised during the fighting. Furthermore, good portions of the country, especially the major cities, are still under martial law, and their economic productivity has been effectively slowed.\n\nMoreover, many regional actors such as local governors and administrators have grown unruly due to the weakness of the Kuomintang and the lack of effective centralised authority. Corruption is rampant, and there are claims that some villages are in starvation without food supplies. Money hoarding, banditry, and violence pervade throughout the country and government agencies/police are finding it to difficult to control the nation. Outside investors to the Republic of China have also called in their loans due to the shaky nature of Nationalist political power, and the welfare policies of the Party have effectively been placed on hold since the Civil War."

 CHI.endgame.803.d: "Throughout the Party, there is a consistent fear that there is always an ever-present danger or the potential of a \"second wave\" of unrest, given the chaos of the Kuomintang Civil War. Party leaders and officials walk with fear even in broad daylight, fearing they may become victim to the next day's newspaper heading.\n\nAlthough Chairman Zeng Zhongming is seen as a more palatable leader than Chen Gongbo due to his connections to the Party's Residence Faction, he simply isn't enough for many in the Reorganised Comrades Association. The RCA yearns for the completion of the national and social revolution; to them, there is no one more capable of carrying out the radical revolution than Chen himself. Tensions have been growing between the Residence Faction and the Reorganised Faction as both factions are now suspecting the other for potentially seeking to remove the other from Party influence.\n\nDespite the persistence of the Young Guard Clique and the Political Department in maintaining order, Chen Gongbo's own paranoia has skyrocketed, and he sees enemies at every corner. He has taken the death of the Chairman particularly hard, and he sees the Military as the primary cause for the party's weakness. To him, the Provisional Action Committee, India Clique, the CRS, and even the Internationale Military Mission in China have been responsible to some degree of stoking the flames of unrest.\n\nHe has further taken out his anger on Zhou Enlai's Red Squad and for General Zhang Zhizhong for having not done enough to protect the beloved Chairman. As such, there are rumours and whispers in the dark that the Young Guard is seeking to have Chairman Zeng Zhongming step it up and to take a harsher and more firm stance against the Premier."

 CHI.endgame.804.d: "It's no secret that the Chairman of the Kuomintang, Zeng Zhongming, does enjoy a good drink now and there. Since his youth, he has found himself enamored with a lifestyle of culture - surronding himself with affairs, nightlife, and an always present bottle of Merlot. Now however, the Chairman has grown increasingly reclusive and has avoided public appearances out of sheer depression as a result of the death of his two friends Wang Jingwei and Chen Bijun. Furthermore, he finds himself placed into a position of high stress, paranoia, and pressure as his political experience pales in compairson with some of the more vocal ideologues of the RCA.\n\nTo Zeng, Wang is more than just a friend and a comrade, he is a loving mentor - a teacher and a model to follow. Every night in the Presidential Palace, Zeng locks himself in his study and spends his long hours composing beautiful poems dedicated to his fallen friend and mourns that it should have been Zeng not Wang who had to die. Drowning himself in his sorrows, many within the Reorganised Comrades Association are aware of the Chairman's battle with the vices and some have began whispering plans to depose the Chairman in favour of a much more organised and stable leadership. It is clear that as long as the Chairman struggles with his liquor, the fate of the Party continues to hang in balance."

 CHI.endgame.805.d: "After a long struggle with alcohol, Chairman Zeng Zhongming has decided to fully commit himself to sobriety. The first few weeks... no, the first few days were hell on earth. From hand shakes to headaches, the Chairman often had to excuse himself from meetings with members of the Central Committee, much to the smug satisifcation of those in the RCA such as Shi Cuntong and Chen Gongbo. Nonetheless, with his sister Zeng Xing by his side, the Chairman has forsaken drinking and has taken it upon to himself, to focus on French and Chinese literature in his freetime.\n\nNow, with significant government reforms underway and his confidence restored, the Zeng of today is not the Zeng of yesterday. There are few rumours suggesting to overthrow the young Chairman, as the Chairman now finds himself confident enough to host long meetings and make public addresses. His paranoia, while lingering, is no longer the same as it was when he inherited the position of Chairman from his late teacher."

 CHI.endgame.841.d: "Held within the Judicial Yuan, although dominated by the presence of the Reorganised Comrades Association, the ringing gavel and cries of \"Guilty!\" rang throughout the halls of the Kuomintang's high court. One by one, high-ranking members of the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association were marched to the stand and, despite their staunch defences, were sentenced to the firing squad. Those lucky have fled overseas or gone into hiding, and a nationwide manhunt is being held for Deng Yanda.\n\nThe Political Department of the NRA has struggled to deal with the army's size and lack of effective administration, given that much of the former leadership has effectively ben purged by the RCA. While the RCA does envision a China where the military plays as minimal of a role in national politics as possible, the lack of a capable military administration is also concerning, given that the reactionary powers may threaten China. \n\nStill, there are those lower ranking in the WMARCA who have pleaded for amnesty and have declared that they would swear loyalty to the new regime and support the Party fully with devotion. These generals are socialists and believe that the RCA's socialism is in tune with their own personal beliefs - in addition to having been rendered submissive by the destruction of PAC's leadership. There are also radical young officers like Lin Biao within the China Revival Society who find that the RCA's radicalism and direction towards authoritarianism match their own ideologies. Of course, the new military could rely on their loyalists within the Young Guard, but these generals certainly lack the experience of those in the CRS and WMARCA."

 CHI.endgame.842.d: "The land issue has never been neglected in the ideology and doctrine of the Kuomintang - in fact, the late Dr. Sun spoke vividly about the \"land to the tiller\" and \"equalisation of land rights\". The First National Party Congress, after all proclaimed that equalisation of land rights was one of the two main factors of Minsheng, the People's Livelihood. During the First and Second Northern Expeditions, the Party's policies towards the peasantry were conducted and in some liberated areas of the Expedition, rent-reduction campaigns were vigorously conducted.\n\nChen Gongbo and the Reorganised Comrades Association have also expressed a great interest in maintaining the mass movement through the means of radical land reform in comparison with the orthodox approach laid out by Dr. Sun. Chen Gongbo's primary approach is to methodically have the government pass land laws so that the National Government may be able to seize land lawfully. The other approach, which is supported by most radicals of the radicals in the RCA is to promote \"land confiscation\", of which landowner lands are to be confiscated by the peasants.\n\nChen Gongbo and more moderate members of the RCA favour the first approach on the account that land would not be fully distributed by the second method, and that land would now just be in the hands of a private peasantry. Still, the members of the RCA agree in unison that lands from all big landowners must be seized at once and the large landowners driven off from their lands. Party members, however, disagree on the status of the small and middle landowners, who are considered a potentially revolutionary class in the form of a petite bourgeoisie; with Chen maintaining a more moderate course compared to some of his more radical colleagues."

Party members are encouraged to keep tabs on each other, and local officials keep lists of the number of Reorganised Comrades Association members in their towns and residences. Young children in the Youth Corps are told by their teachers and instructors to report their parents to the police and the Party - if their parents present dissenting opinions on the Party or the RCA's leaders.\n\nFurthermore, there has been an increasing attempt by the RCA to create a cult of personality centred around the Late Leader, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and recently deceased Chairman, Wang Jingwei. Portraits of Sun and Wang are found in nearly every public building, and families frequently dine beneath a portrait of Sun and Wang. Propaganda posters and radios frequently depict the glory of the Nationalist Revolution and show Chairman Zeng and Premier Chen as glorious and infallible leaders. In universities and schools, students have been agitating against their professors, with some students even reporting their teachers for \"counter-revolutionary\" thought and ousting their instructors for rightist beliefs.There isn't much opposition to the leadership of the RCA-radicals as the few military generals around, such as Zhang Zhizong and Zhou Enlai, follow the instructions of the Premier with almost zero hesitance (either out of fear or fear of political instability). At the same time, Zeng Zhongming and the remnants of the Residence Faction find themselves powerless to do much. Perhaps there are those within the government who can ask Chen to pursue a less radical direction for the revolution but at this point, is there much that one can do?"

 CHI.endgame.844.d: "Since the Reorganised Comrades Association secured victory in the intra-party civil war, many of the Party's more bourgeois or wealthier elements have fled the country, having seen the writing on the wall. Many in the Reconstruction Faction's leadership have been brought to trial for their crimes against the state in participating in Sun Fo's short-lived government - with grim futures awaiting them.\n\nWith Song Qingling under house arrest and Deng Yanda missing - the remaining opposition toward the dominance of the RCA has dwindled to only a few opposition leaders. Sun Fo and loyal followers of his clique, including Wu Chaoshu (C.C. Wu), Liang Hancao, Huang Hanliang, and Wang Kunlun - have fled the country, their whereabouts unknown. At least this was the case until a Red Squad agent abroad in Southeast Asia has wired back to Nanjing that the late leader's arrogant son would soon be visiting the city of Manila in the Philippines to greet the overseas Chinese community.\n\nIt seems that Wang Kunlun has betrayed the old \"iron-necked\" liberal. While a long-time friend of Sun Fo, Wang (a staunch leftist) has been a secret member of the RCA and fearing for his family's safety - has chosen to betray Sun Fo in exchange for amnesty in the new Reorganised government. He has promised to help us provided that Sun Fo does not get hurt and is allowed to return back to China safely. It is up to Chen Gongbo, the Premier of the Republic, to decide what to do with this information. While there are urgent reports that Sun Fo is organising an overseas government in exile and seeking to retake the mainland, surely he isn't serious and won't plan to try anything. And besides, the Red Squad, ever loyal to the Party, can always be utilised to deal with these threats to the Central Committee. Of course, this is Sun Fo - the late leader's son - but Chen won't stoop to that level... would he?"

However, claiming that he was under the weather at the last minute, Sun Fo was absent from the evening festivities. Nonetheless, prominent Reconstruction Faction members such as Wu Chaoshu and Huang Hanliang were in attendance, and those in attendance raised toasts to Dr. Sun's son and to the end of the Reorganised Comrades Association.\n\nThe dinner toasts were cut short as two disguised gunmen pulled out their concealed sub-machine guns and fired into the crowd - before running out of the parlor and into the night. In the chaos of the gunfire, both Wu Chaoshu and Huang Hanliang were killed - but the assassins had not known about Sun Fo's change of plans and had thus missed their original target.\n\nIn the wake of the bloodshed, Wang Kunlun, with perhaps a change of consciousness, has revealed to Sun Fo the Red Squad's role and has apologised profusely to Sun Fo for he believed that we had attempted to organise Sun's extradition back into China rather than an attempted assassination. With Sun's fury matching his father's, Wang's fate will be left up to the mercy of Sun Fo and his few remaining supporters.\n\nSun Fo has declared a new Reconstruction Government and has angrily denounced the government in Nanjing as an illegitimate Chinese government. Finding a new second wind in his political career, he has declared a Kuomintang government-in-exile. However, he lacks support from any major nation, nor does he have an actual base to prepare his counter-revolution. While our assassins have certainly failed in their objectives, we shall pay no mind to this reactionary rightist attempting to cause unrest in our revolution."

 CHI.endgame.846.d: "In a busy and well-to-do neighbourhood of Manila, the Chinese Overseas Merchants Association had organised a grand party in a Chinese dining parlor to commemorate the arrival of Sun Fo in the Philippines. Many of the guests had expected the son of the Chinese Kuomintang's founder to deliver a grandiose speech, and there were even talks that Sun Fo was organising the expatriate community to resist the Reorganised Comrades Association. Those in attendance included Wu Chaoshu, Huang Hanliang, and Wang Kunlun, amongst the other leaders of the Reconstruction Faction, which had joined Sun Fo in exile. Cheers and toasts to the son of the eternal premier were raised, with many also adding in extra toasts to the end of the Chen-Zeng leadership.\n\nThe dinner toasts were cut short as two disguised gunmen pulled out their concealed submachine guns and fired into the crowd - before running out of the parlor and into the night. In the chaos of the gunfire, several luminaries of the Reconstruction Faction present were murdered including Sun Fo - who had been unable to escape the same fate as Wang Jingwei. Perhaps to tie up loose ends, Wang Kunlun was also murdered - despite the latter having agreed to betray Sun Fo for his and his family's safety.\n\nDespite this, everyone knew the true culprits behind the attack. A sense of dread has settled upon the expatriate community, especially with the murder of the son of the Kuomintang's founder. To some, Sun's attempts to build a rival government led him to receive the fate he did. Still, many are horrified with how ruthlessly the Chen-Zeng RCA leadership settled the manner, and the RCA has made it clear how they will deal with those who oppose its domination of the Kuomintang."

The idealistic alliance of non-Kuomintang-aligned socialists has fallen into disunity due to the greater factional struggles between the Party. As a result of their support to the Provisional Action Committee, the World Society of anarchists has been effectively banned by the Party, with most of its leaders having fled for exile elsewhere. Meanwhile, for most of the Orthodox Faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, their leaders and followers either chose ambivalence during the civil war or supported the PAC. As a result, many of them have been sidelined by the new \"Reorganisation\" - with the Premier declaring that they were merely rightists in disguise.On the other hand, the Radicals of the CSP supported the RCA during the Kuomintang Civil War.\n\n Many in the Radical Factions hold similar radically socialist and broadly authoritarian views of socialism in comparison with the other factions of the LCS. They, too, see history from purely materialist concepts, the idea of a revolutionary cadre to lead the masses, and the ideas of class struggle. Now, with the National Congress of the Chinese Syndicalist Party approaching rapidly - CSP Old Guard leaders such as Chen Duxiu and Li Lisan are confronted with a dividing party, as it is clear the radicals are seeking to fold into the RCA.\n\nChen Gongbo's pervasive influence through the CSP is felt through the radical Shi Cuntong, who was once a member of the CSP. Nonetheless, despite the radicals' immense popularity, the Orthodox Faction may still have a chance to win this election as both Li Lisan and Chen Duxiu are seen as respectable and founding members of the Party."

His wife's wishes were also to have been buried in Guangdong and as such, it would make logical sense for the two to be buried together. On the other hand, more radical members of the Party have advocated for Wang to be buried at the semi-completed National Mausoleum near the second peak of the Purple Mountain.

His wife is close with the Lingnan School of Painting and is a professor by training. One of the few prominent female Chinese painters, she has brought her acclaimed solo exhibition down from Shanghai to her home province of Fujian, no doubt to woo over the former rebellious province. Her family, almost all long-time Kuomintang members, have also been doing work all across the province to push a path of reconciliation - although the family's wealth has come under attack by members of the Reorganised Comrades Association.\n\nHis older sister Zeng Xing, also a prominent Kuomintang member, has taken up a post as the head of the Ministry of Women. Never insignificant, people have nonetheless noted an increase in public appearances, filling in the vacuum in national female leadership now that Song Qingling has retired from the national stage to \"focus on charity work\".\n\nZeng has travelled around the county, giving speeches and trying to calm tensions. Although mostly a figurehead and for the most the silent partner for Wang Jingwei, he has managed to carve out a powerful niche for himself as a national symbol of stability. His Public Relations team have worked to ensure he is always photographed with respectability as he tours the regional party offices, newly built factories, military bases, and meets with civic groups. He is no Wang Jingwei, but even his worst detractors have to admit he has been effective in anchoring the new government's legitimacy."

 CHI.endgame.850.t: "Chen's Theory of National Capitalism"
 CHI.endgame.850.d: "As the National Revolution is led by China's workers and peasants,  it is unthinkable that these two classes would aim to establish a capitalist state. Moreover, the bourgeoisie in China has yet to coalesce into a distinct class and was too weak to dominate the political and economic scene. As China is so economically backward and her economy controlled by imperialist powers, the state has to play an important role to build capital and to assist industrial development. Once sufficient capital was achieved, China could develop into a modernised society and truly head towards socialism.\n\nAs an economist, Chen's writings on national capitalism are perhaps some of the most eloquent within the Kuomintang. He has recently published an article \"How to build State Capital at the present time\", clarifying that the Principle of Minsheng is by nature a state intervention policy. To build state capital, Chen agreed with Sun Yat-sen that the state should nationalise railways, big enterprises, and the mining industries, but he also expands on this by declaring that the Party should also enforce the nationalisation of foreign trade.\n\nPrivate capital should not be excluded in the economic development of China, rather he has stressed the complementary role of private capital to help build a future China. Through the establishment of joint government-merchant enterprises, chartered companies could control foreign trade profits while helping peasant-worker cooperatives increase production.\n\nOf course, to many, Chen's theory raises the idea of whether or not this would simply lead China to capitalism. But Chen has refuted these ideas, declaring that the presence of the Party and state control of the economy would prevent unrestrained economic growth. Chen also stressed the participation of the working class and peasantry into developing China's new economy. When state industry had reached a certain size, the majority of the working class can be integrated and save them from being exploited by capital - with the same concept applying to the peasants. Over time, the class distinctions between peasants, workers, and allied petite bourgeoisie would diminish as they would both be merely \"producers of society,\" therefore with national capitalism comes the inevitable tide of socialism."

Over the years of the Unification Campaigns, the NRA has greatly expanded to amass plenty of officers from the warlord armies to accommodate the growing military forces. Furthermore, in local administrations of provincial regions - local mercenaries and former warlord administrators have often been reinstated due to the speed and advance of the NRA.\n\nThere have also been Kuomintang sympathisers in regions outside the territory of the National Revolutionary Government, such as General Chen Mingshu and General Zhu De who have... questionable loyalties, to say the least. Many of these officers hold rather high positions and are seen by the Premier of the Republic to be either rightists or anti-revolutionaries.\n\nThe Premier and the Young Guard of the NRA seek to purge these reactionary elements and to foster a new revolutionary spirit in the halls of Whampoa. Still, this move is unpopular among some in the NRA - who are worried that further purges would merely destabilise and demoralise the already weary NRA. Surely, after all - these officers offer more in practical military knowledge rather than political matters. However, the Chairman only sees enemies behind every corner, and the army must be fully converted to the ideas of the revolution if the revolution is to be kept safe from collapsing into degenercy."

Certainly, Chen is the main muscle behind the government, and he has been compared to other great Premier/Chancellor-like figures in the West, such as cardinal de Richelieu and Otto von Bismarck (while political opponents of the Chen-Zeng regime denounce Chen as merely Cao Cao with red paint).\n\nNonetheless, Zeng has proven himself to be more than just a puppet figurehead and has gained confidence in party politics. While initially reluctant and depressed to carry on the leadership left behind by his dear revolutionary comrade Wang Jingwei, Zeng's energy in reaching out to the peoples of the country as well as his own charisma - allows him to play a mediating role between what's left of the Residence Faction and the RCA. He is able to prevent the excesses of radicalism from spilling over into society, and as Chairman, he does have the power to hold back the worst of Chen Gongbo's more radical reforms.\n\nWith a supposedly collective leadership (albeit dominated by the RCA), Chairman Zeng is leading China to accomplish the final will left behind by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and to honour the sacrifices of the great Chairman Wang. Wang's portrait can be spotted in nearly all government buildings and his likeliness deified - as he is depicted as the most exemplary revolutionary there can possibly be behind Sun Yat-sen. As he goes on his long walks to reduce the stress of his position as Chairman, Chairman Zeng thinks that if Wang were still alive, he would be proud of his fellow brother in the national revolution.\n\nBut for now, there is work to be done. The revolution is still not complete, and Chen and Zeng are determined to finish it. Until then, one can only see whether the KMT will eventually lead the workers and peasants to full democracy."

In his resignation letter, he cited his struggling mental health as well as a desire to \"spend more time with his family\" as the reason why. The exhausted Chairman emeritus was thanked and wished well by Premier Chen Gongbo and other party elites in a pleasant parting celebration hosted on his last day in his position.\n\nIt was followed by a quick Central Committee vote, Chen Gongbo was elected as the next Chairman of the Kuomintang joined by Shi Cuntong as Premier. At Nanjing's Presidential Palace, Chen Gongbo gave a fiery speech to a mass rally of thousands of members of the Reorganised Comrades Association and the Youth Corps, his eyes burning with ambition and passion. With eloquent hand gestures akin to the former Chairman Wang Jingwei, Chen angrily denounced the capitalist nations of the West and promised that capitalism was to be destroyed by the revolutionary fervor of the Chinese people. As he concluded his speech, the Chairman declared the continuation of the national revolution until all rightists were removed from the country and urged the youth of China to seek modernism, progress, and adopt a cultural revolution against traditional bourgeois degeneracy.\n\nAs China blazes forward with its all-encompassing revolution, Chen has recently commissioned a statue of Wang Jingwei to stand alongside a statue of Sun Yat-sen in Nanjing. The Chairman has not forgotten Wang's leadership over the years and hopes that Wang would be proud of him for reviving the Kuomintang, reorganising the Party, and finally fulfilling the National Revolution.

Shifting the balance too far in one side will destabilise the revolution, but be warned - if neither side has a clear advantage, a third scenario might emerge...§!"
 CHI_rf_mechanic_explanation_tt: "§CThe §lReconstruction Faction's§! influence is tracked by §lSocial Liberal Popularity§! in the party wheel. At lower levels, they help serve as a moderating influence that §Greduces radicalism§!, but at higher levels they will be seen as subversive and §Rincrease radicalism§!.

 CHI_lcs_mechanic_explanation_tt: "§CThe §rLeague of Chinese Syndicalists§! is an unwieldy coalition, and its influence depends on which faction dominates it. In order of increasing starting influence, the §RCSP-Radicals§! are materialist socialist hardliners who align with the RCA and increase radicalism. The §SWorld Society§! is an old guard, utopian influence that favours the PAC. Lastly, the §rCSP-Orthodox Faction§! is a wildcard, favouring a side as needed while reducing radicalism overall.§!"
 CHI_rad_mechanic_explanation_tt: "§CRadicalism within the Kuomintang will rise and fall depending on event choices.

 CHI_rf_mechanic_warning_tt: "§RThe influence of the liberal §lReconstruction Faction§! has grown too high to be compatible with a socialist revolution. Keeping §lsocial liberal§! popularity low or hiring §lSun Fo§! as an advisor will help improve the internal perception of this faction, but be warned that if their influence continues to go unchecked radicalism will only increase.§!"
 CHI_rad_mechanic_warning_tt: "§RRadicalism is rising within the Kuomintang, representing political polarisation, social division and military discontent. While some radicalism is to be expected in a revolutionary movement, it is wise to temp it down or at least keep it lower than the support of the RCA/PAC. Otherwise some radicals may conclude that the present Central Committee is rudderless, and perhaps they must be overthrown too!§!"
 CHI_bop_mechanic_warning_tt: "§RThe Balance of Power has gone too far in one direction!

The Party Central cannot exercise control over these groups and the party branches have been forced to comply with the wishes of the National Revolutionary Army.

Chen Shaoyu was born into a poor peasant family and entered Zhicheng Elementary School in Gushi County. He then entered the Agricultural School of Anhui Province which was founded by the revolutionary Zhu Yunshan, who had a profound influence on the school's students - introducing many progressive journals and books. He was also highly influenced by his teacher Qian Xinchun, who would teach Chen Shaoyu about famous leaders such as the martyr Vladimir Lenin and Chen Duxiu. During his school years, he became highly active in the political movement and led boycotts against Japanese and German products and corrupt elections. He formally joined the Chinese Syndicalist Party in the summer of 1924 and participated in the May 30th Movement on the eve of the Northern Expedition.\n\nAfter the expedition's failure, the newly organised League of Chinese Syndicalists sent Chen Shaoyu to study at the Sun Yat-sen University in Montargis, France, where he was able to master the French language and became enamoured with the \"ultra-syndicalism\" movement within the Commune of France. It was here that he became a leader of the more radical members of the Chinese syndicalist revolution, those that believe that the revolution must be handled by the workers and unions in its true orthodox form. The radical tone of these politically ambitious and younger Chinese syndicalists has earned them the moniker of being the \"Radical\" faction and their presence represents some of the tensions that permeated both the League of Chinese Syndicalists and the fragile united front with the Kuomintang.\n\nAfter a tumultuous opening of the National People's Congress, CSP Radicals staged a soft coup that allowed them to force out their more moderate \"Orthodox\" rivals, setting the stage for Chen to take control of the fledging government."

He joined the Kuomintang in hoping to overthrow the Hunan government, becoming an advisor to Sun Yat-sen. He became friends with Li Shizeng, growing with the Paris Anarchists' \"(New) World Society\". Yi became their mouthpiece within the League of Chinese Syndicalists, hoping to rally anarchist and syndicalist thinkers closer to the Kuomintang establishment while preventing the party from drifting too close to authoritarianism.\n\nAfter a tumultuous opening of the National People's Congress, the clever manoeuvring of the World Society allowed them to rally anarchists, dissatisfied members of the League, and Kuomintang remnants to usurp control of the LCS from CSP control.

Due to his background in being Shanghainese and his own connections throughout the city, he was naturally approached by Zhou Enlai to head a branch of Teke in Shanghai."

Wang Shijian began his political career as a Chinese syndicalist ordered to help organise a secret radio station to rally Nationalist and socialist propaganda against the Zhili and their Manchu allies. He quickly rose up the ranks to become a party secretary of the Hebei Provincial Anti-Imperialist League, a peripheral organisation of the League of Chinese Syndicalists. As the Kuomintang and LCS lack a major presence in the Chinese Central Plains, Wang was a quick choice for a candidate to participate in Zhou Enlai's newly founded Zhongyang Teke."

As a young child, Kang Sheng was educated at a German school in Qingdao, earning him a eternal hatred for the German Empire. After graduating from the German school, Kang taught in a rural school in Zhucheng before leaving for Shanghai in 1924. In Shanghai, he enrolled in Shanghai University, then led by the Chinese Syndicalist Party - and then he joined the Youth League of the CSP. After formally joining the party, he participated in the February 1925 strike that culminated in the May 30th Movement and he also participated in the reorganisation of the CSP into the League of Chinese Syndicalists.\n\nAfter the failure of the Northern Expedition, Kang remained in China as a labour organiser and security operative of the LCS. He married fellow Shandong native Cao Yi'ou and entered the employment of Yu Qiaqing - whose connections with the Kuomintang helped put Kang in contact with the KMT. After the KMT's return to China, Kang was approached by Zhou Enlai to head internal security operations of the newly created Zhongyang Teke in Shandong. It is here in Shandong where Kang has earned an infamous reputation as a sadistic interrogator, with his methods arousing the frustration of the Party's Central Committee and of Zhou Enlai. He is known for accusing fellow LCS and even KMT members of harbouring German sympathies and once they confessed under heavy torture - would lead to an avalanche of arrests and purges."

 CHI.midgame.215.d: "Ever since he took power in Liangguang, Right Kuomintang general Li Zongren has been open about his hostility towards the many leftists in his province, especially members of the Chinese Syndicalist Party. But now that he has finally centralised power around himself, Li has started cracking down on leftists within the army and the government, which has led to many fleeing persecution into a more friendly government.\n\nToday, some of them have arrived in [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], swearing their allegiance to the Kuomintang, and offering their help in our revolutionary efforts. Among them are general Ye Jianying from Guangdong, who, despite being a committed member of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, took arms against Chen Jiongming after his betrayal, and helped Sun Yat-sen escape Guangzhou. Alongside him comes general Liu Fei. A former Guangxi officer and member of the Kuomintang, he has nonetheless become a target of rightist persecution, likely due to his suspected syndicalist sympathies. Last is Tan Pingshan. A former member of the Tongmenghui, and leading figure of the Guangdong branch of the CSP, there is no doubt of his desire of seeing revolution in China through. Tan has also expressed sympathy towards Deng Yanda's PAC, and would no doubt be a competent mediating personality working for our coalition, if given the chance.\n\nStill, some dissenting voices are suggesting we turn down their offer. Indeed, fears that their claims of persecution are in reality just a lie, and an attempt by spies to access high levels of government and army command, are raising alarming concerns."

 CHI.lategame.220.intro: "The Kuomintang have long received our extensive support, perhaps most directly through the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine (MMIC). Despite this generosity, nationalist jealousy and intra-party bickering resulted in an animosity between the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) Old Guard and the MMIC, as NRA officers sought scapegoats for their growing pile of shortcomings.\n\nEven on the cusp of victory, the eastern proletarian wave continues to be undermined by Kuomintang disunity, the discord unleashing a wave of violence across the newly liberated nation ahead of an important party congress. Three MMIC advisors were wounded, and one killed - lynched by a mob identified as sympathetic to the reactionary \"India Clique\" of the NRA."

There he became an alcohol, opium addict, and playboy, though covered the Kuomintang revolution extensively in his writings. Once considered for overall leadership of the MMIC, his growing vices and sympathies for Sorelianism saw him passed over in favour of the more popular André Malraux. Still, he will be missed."

Coming from a relatively well-off family, Qin was admitted to Jiangsu Provincial Second Industrial School where he became exposed to new ideas such as socialism. In 1924, the Xi Society was formed by Wuxi students and Qin Bangxian served as head of the Suzhou Committee of the Xi Society. When the May 30th Massacre occurred in Shanghai, Qin personally led a 1925 demonstration of more than 3,000 students to protest the injustices of foreign imperialism. Organising the student movement drained Qin and he dropped out of the college shortly after.\n\nThat September, he was admitted to the Department of Sociology, studying under the syndicalist Qu Qiubai and joining the Chinese Syndicalist Party by November. Around that time, the Kuomintang and League of Chinese Syndicalists were organising in the First United Front - and thus Qin Bangxian was sent to Shanghai to help organise the revolution. However, the expedition's failure drove many to exile and Qin Bangxian fled to France to avoid persecution.\n\nDue to his excellent French, Qin Bangxian became an interpreter at the newly formed Sun Yat-sen University in Paris. He and a group of more radical syndicalists began to draw towards the idea of orthodox Marxism and rejected the Orthodox Faction leadership of the Chinese Syndicalist Party. In 1930, Qin returned back to China to serve as a propaganda officer in the 1932 Shanghai Uprising on behalf of the All China Federation of Trade Unions.§!\n\n§YNotes: With the victory of the RCA-Radicals, Qin has received a prominent government position to solidify the Kuomintang's alliance with the Chinese Syndicalist Party.§!"

Patriotic songs have been written, pamphlets printed out and posters drawn up in a concerted effort to drum up patriotic spirit. But perhaps most striking is the President's new wardrobe: Wang Jingwei has been sure to be photographed in a military uniform wherever he goes, casting aside his usual civilian attire.\n\nAccording to government press, this is to stand in solidarity with the Kuomintang's brave soldiers in the National Revolutionary Army and to stress the total nature of the coming war. Through both visual and written media, they have sought to portray the Chairman as a capable wartime leader, and in natural company with the generals.\n\nCritical commentators note that Wang has long been at odds with military men, including the late Chiang Kai-shek and his current nemesis Deng Yanda. According to them, donning a military uniform to emphasize his role as commander-in-chief is nothing more than a petty effort to assert dominance in military matters with other members of the Military Affairs Commission. Perhaps most irksome to critics is his custom rank insignia, ostensibly to denote his symbolic position as Grand Marshal of the Army and Navy.\n\nDisagreements about vanity aside, the looming war may very well dictate the future of revolution.

 CHI.endgame.446.t: "The Elders' Revenge"
 CHI.endgame.446.d: "With the ascent of the World Society in Kuomintang leadership, the Four Elders have becoming increasingly influential in party decision making. Anarchist ideals have become common-place in party rhetoric, even if the tutelage is expected to continue for some time. Discussions continue between the Elders, who prefer on principle to eschew any formal (non-academic) government post, and President Song but one thing both agree on is that the League of Chinese Syndicalists has outlived its purpose.\n\nCreated on the initiative of the Chinese Syndicalist Party to counter-balance Kuomintang power in the United Front, the World Society begrudgingly joined to stem their then fading relevance in the syndicalist scene. Almost inherently unstable, with the different strains of Marxists, Vanguardists, Syndicalists and Anarchists rarely coming to any common ground, the victory of the World Society has ironically sounded its death knell.\n\nAfter years of bitterness, plotting, and infighting, the Four Elders are finally able to enact their revenge. Citing reports of continued dissent by radical members of the CSP, they have brought the matter directly before Song to demand the entire CSP be banned for the duration of the tutelage as counter-revolutionary. In their view, the Kuomintang is already on course to become the truly anarchist, liberation party it was meant to be, and the CSP can only act as a jealous, corrupting force.\n\nPremier Deng Yanda has lent some support to this plan, arguing that the CSP present a continued security risk and effectively serve as a vehicle for foreign infuence in the Republic. He hopes to defang lingering MMIC influence in the military, though the United Front with the LCS (under World Society leadership) shall remain intact.\n\nChen Youren, the foreign minister, has advised caution. Having worked night and day to repair ties with the international socialist movement, he warns a crack down will cause global damage our democratic image and sap good will towards our cause."

Many wonder what life after the revolution will look like, as do their remaining family, dependants and caregivers.\n\nIn [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], efforts to create comprehensive social programs to honour Kuomintang promises have stalled due to troubled planning and bickering over how to pay for them. The Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association (WMARCA) has lobbied the Central Committee to give priority to the soldiers, many who are expected to be demobilised in the coming years. They have called for a wide slate of veterans' pensions, scholarships, and public support for the crippled. In public addresses, Premier Deng Yanda and other generals insist that in the same way soldiers dutily serve their commanders, their commanders in turn must take care of their men.\n\nQuiet opposition has emerged however. The generosity of these proposals however have raised major questions about how sustainable they will be after large numbers of NRA veterans age. Others doubt the WMARCA's intentions. Unlike the armies of the warlords, the NRA were supposed to fight for people, not just the officers that reward them with spoils of conquest. To them, such political meddling is unbecoming of the people's army. It is undisputed that their loyalty must be returned, but they also fought for equitable treatment for all people.\n\nUltimately, the Republic was built on the sacrifices of nearly an entire generation of young men. But countless others also sacrificed for the revolution, and continue suffer. This matter has become an increasingly public, sensitive issue, with protesting veterans gathering outside the Legislative Yuan in their old uniforms. A compromise has been offered to merge it with plans for a streamlined civil service pension. Some say it does not go far enough, others fear this is the revival of the old class hierarchies.
