 SAFWAR.3.d:0 "The building shook from what must have been an artillery shell or maybe even a near-hit from a bomb, but Lucas DeFlandre looked remarkably disinterested for a man who was certainly about to meet his death. He, along with about two dozen of the remaining members of his mercenary company \"Les Oies Sauvages\" had fallen back to the innermost conference room of the mansion that was now serving as the headquarters of the Zentralafrikan defense effort. DeFlandre watched, disinterested through his remaining eye as two of the remaining guns for hire erected a makeshift waist-high barricade at the door using the conference table and assorted furniture. It wouldn't do much in the long run he thought to himself, and besides, he was too tired from fighting a days long running battle with OFN forces to care much anymore.\n\nThe squad that had stayed behind to cover the mansion's foyer had stopped radioing in some time ago amidst the sounds of heavy gunfire and screams of pain. The handful that had been sent to secure an exit never even responded, and most likely had fled. Good for them, DeFlandre muttered to himself as he picked up his weapon and began to reload and clean it, no reason we all have to die here. Truthfully, he wasn't entirely sure why he hadn't bolted at the first sign of what was coming, but he suspected that deep down it had something to do with that damned pride of his that had carried him through conflicts across the globe with only the utmost professionalism. He had never run on the job, and it seemed like he wasn't about to break that streak. The heavy explosions began again and he smiled humorlessly at the thought of another American platoon walking headlong into the mines they had so carefully prepared. Gunfire could be heard dimly from beyond the room, signalling to the veteran that at least some of the men of the Zentralafrikan army had also chosen to fight. Little by little though, the gunfire slackened as each pocket was rooted out and destroyed. He heard the sound of running feet down the hallway that led to the room, then a scream as the last anti-personnel mine they had deployed took out a few more damned Yanks. Time was up, and their enemy would be at their gate in just a moment. He stood up, and as his men turned to watch their leader he flashed a smile, Well, just another job, no?"

 SAFWAR.5.d:0 "As the Americans and South Africans crawled northwards, they were surprised at both the intensity and variation of the resistance they faced. They had known that there would be traps, ambushes, and heroic last-stands a-plenty from the handful of dedicated SS units assigned to the region, but they didn't expect that the German-settler population would so vigorously join in the final battle, or that they would be supported by so many of the native Askaris.\n\nBut in retrospect, it shouldn't have been surprising. For the settlers, there was nowhere left to run, and no one left to negotiate. The Reichskommissar all but vanished into his beloved air as the war turned against them, his battle against his inner demons lost with the broader way. His inner circle had disappeared as well, or fled back to the Reich. There was no such luxury available to either the average German or their native allies. Zentalafrika was chaos, Ostafrika was death, and the passage home too expensive for commoners. To surrender meant likely capture by the African partisans, who did not look fondly on either the Nazi or their collaborators.\n\nSo they fought. Not for their vacant leader, or for the fatherland that had abandoned them, or the ideals of National Socialism that had been so poorly applied. They fought for survival, because it was the only thing left to do.\n\nIn the plains of the south, the Americans found only brush and bombs. In the forests of Angola, there were Germans in every shadow. In the villages and towns soldiers spoke grimly of battles won for the living room, but ongoing for the kitchen. They would not give in. If not for victory, they fought to avoid defeat, and to live just one more day."

 SAFWAR.8.d:0 "The solemn thoughts of the war and its toll trailed behind the troops who had been stationed on base, preparing for the arrival of the new divisions being shipped in. Everywhere you looked, men were clearing the way out of vehicle depots, worn out armored personnel carriers and tanks treaded down the makeshift roads setup within the base, and officers berated their subordinates for not pushing cargo out of the way fast enough for the incoming soldiers meant to help reinforce and strengthen the border against the South Africans. All the while, the Reichskommissar looked onwards, bearing the heat of the ever-burning African sun, as nary a zephyr gifted from Valhalla served the Germans that day. Blessings were, after all, slim to begin with in this war.\n\nJust earlier this week, the surrounding compound had been awoken from the emergency broadcast transmissions from the Großgermanisches Reich itself. Through the static of the transmissions, they managed to get several key notifications, including \"United States...entering... South Afrika... Reich... reinforcements... victory... not lost!\" The base had entered a feverish excitement in knowing that their savior, the Fatherland, had provided so plentifully past the horrors that the African continent managed to generate seemingly every day. The lack of an undrenched uniform, the constant wear and tear upon both their equipment and their blood, finally, the men would be able to enjoy a new bolstering of men to fight shoulder-to-shoulder in the endless savannahs of this accursed continent. Admittedly, there was continued talk about what could happen out there on the front lines with the Americans lining up to fight as well, but none could surpass the Großgermanisches Reich! As the day had finally arrived, and the distant sounds of trucks and other German machines of war poured into the base's surrounding air, the men had finally finished their preparations for all the reinforcements that were due to arrive"

 SAFWAR.9.d:0 "The march southwards was one embraced with blood. Battle after battle, the screams and begging of wounded men to be killed grew tiresome for Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig, finally being squashed out of their miserable existence as the tank treads inched forwards. The Schutzstaffel regiments of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika had proved successful warriors upon the Afrikan front, and this final siege proved no different from every other butchery.\n\nThe final battle erupted as the Ostafrikan commitment to the war had begun: under the strict orders of Hüttig. The odor of smoke and burnt flesh coupled with the screaming continued for hours, until, from the safety of the Forward Operating Base, the Reichskommissar could bear no more of this wait. He ordered the immediate advance of his regiments across the Afrikan plain, until it would assault the Cape, last bastion of defence. Thus, they marched onwards, burning the land, under the strict orders to not leave a denizen alive.\n\nAnd thus, under the burning stars of the Afrikan night, Hüttig awaited the news of the battle. Echoes of gunfire erupted, followed by the eventual rising flames of the city as he heard tank shells crumpling the scum-ridden buildings that had made up the city. Finally, hours later, a lone soldier burst into Hüttig's room, causing a thunderous slam as the door hit the wall. The soldier shouted, \"Sir, Reichskommissar Hüttig, sir, news from the-\" \"Rottenführer.\" Hüttig interrupted. \"You allowed a draft in, the Afrikan night is cold, you know.\" He said, immediately shooting up from his seat and walking to the soldier, with a bottle in hand. \"Sir, my dearest apologies, sir. I was sent to inform you of the victory over South Africa, the combatants have been flushed out. Our regiments, alongside those of Reichskommissars Schenck and Müller have claimed victory tonight, sir.\" the soldier finished. \"Victory... did you say that of Reichskommissars Schenck and Müller?\" \"Yes, si-\" the soldier's statement was cut off as Hüttig smashed his bottle over his head, ordering him out the room.\n\nThe end to the war was Hüttig's victory, and Hüttig's victory alone, in his mind."

However, the bounty laden within his plentiful schedule would be surely harvested later, Müller realized, as his battalion had reached the rallying point drawn out on the war map. As the bombardment that had torn apart the city finally ceased, Müller hopped upon a massive boulder, and shouted to his battalion, \"Gentlemen of Zentralafrika, the Reich has tasked us for a mission, and now, we get to employ it as dutifully and properly as possible. Henceforth, you shall carry out these orders: go into that city with whatever other Germans you find in that field, shoot those American bastards, and let's have ourselves a night on the town!\" Müller's mercenary company roared with compliance, rushing forth into the Afrikan night towards a burning city.\n\nAfter several hours of bored waiting, a lone soldier appeared before Müller, yelling, \"Sir, Reichskommissar, si-\" Müller spit out his drink, startled by the soldier's sudden salute. \"Apologies sir, I was sent to inform you that the city is captured for the glory of the Reich, by the accomplishments of the men of yourself and Reichskommissars Schenck and Hüttig.\" Müller looked upset at the soldier, saying, \"Yeah, whatever, go fuck off to some other plain.\" as he began walking off, preparing himself for his planned schedule.\n\nInside the city, Müller's party raged as intensely as the fires that consumed the livelihoods of thousands. Taking refuge in one of the blown apart taverns of the city, Müller and his men pranced about, chasing after the free bottles of booze and the highly exotic Afrikan narcotics. The men took a moment of calm amidst the storm, as all that filled the air were the embers of burning foundations, flesh, and bone, the smoke of the cigars, even if just for a moment.\n\nSuddenly, a laugh. Then, another soldier laughed, followed by another, until the entire bar was laughing. Then, at that moment, was when the tavern truly roared to life with laughter, booze, and drugs."

 SAFWAR.11.d:0 "Several miles into the Afrikan savannah, rows of German military aircraft were prepped and ready for the immediate launch upon the approval of Reichskommissar Schenck himself, who had been hidden away inside of a forward operating base. Finally, as the Afrikan night sent a chilling shiver down the Reichskommissar's spine, his radio erupted that the bombardment from Ostafrikan forces had begun, while Zentralafrikan infantry had begun their assault. With every fiber of his being urging him not to grab the microphone, Schenck clutched the piece of equipment, saying, \"You may begin the aerial operation in T-10... 9... 8...\" until finally, German aircraft rocketed off into the beautifully icy Afrikan night sky.\n\nThe horrors of the following few hours poured in through the radio within the Reichskommissar's temporary living space. Constantly, he heard the words \"Approaching target,\" \"bombing strafe successful,\" and \"reapproaching city.\" echo through the broadcast, as he silenced his microphone to continue his weeping. The despair had eaten him alive, imagining the terror and chaos reigning down upon the innocent, leaving nothing but death, or a living Hell for those unfortunate souls who survived. Despair had turned to tears, and tears had turned into sobs, as Schenck clasped his face by his rough, calloused hands. The questions of \"How could I do this?\" and \"Why can't I stop this?\" escaped his mind hours ago, with only the uncontrollable emotions of loss, despair, and self-hatred clawing at the man's mind. Finally, as tears trickled down his face, a young soldier burst into the room, shouting, \"Sir, Reichskommissar, sir! The city has been captured for the glory of the Reich, by the accomplishments of your men, as well as Reichskommissars Hüttig and Müller!\" The soldier's announcement was met with silence, however. \"Bring me a truck.\" Schecnk said, coldly.\n\nHours later, Schenck arrived at the city's entrance. Firsthand, he had chosen to bear witness to his crimes, and he had understood the true destruction wrought by his evil compliance in this horrid invasion. Here, Afrikan and American men, women, and children lay dead and dying in the streets, with blood mixing with the rubble and soot. Finally, Schenck finished his journey through the South Afrikan streets as he knelt down, grasping the burnt arm of a child amidst the rubble, with mercenary's laughs and the gunshots of executions flooding in behind him, and tears rolling down his face."

 SAFWAR.13.d:0 "It truly was a mark of the modern precedent of warfare to bear witness to battle which stressed fiercely into the night. Just hours ago, the march of the infantryman was coupled with the gasps and sputters of tanks treading through the African bush, trudging through as the mud and grass as well as any pair of legs or treads could do. Finally, as the men approached the compound, the sickening relief had dawn upon them: this was it. The war would be over after tonight. And nary a soul had the strength to care about how many would have to die in order to destroy the Reichskommissariats, for once and for all. Hours into the artillery strikes, however, the true face of butchery would alight as soldiers rushed beyond the setting sun to meet the strength of the African and the American.\n\nThe gunfire lasted for hours, with some men beginning to bleed strictly from their destroyed ear drums. Rifles, machine guns, anti-tank rifles, anti-aircraft emplacements, artillery barrages, tank shells, even flamethrower units had been used to destroy as much as possible and fight to the bitter end. Trenches hardly did a man good as dirt and gore and limbs were catapulted into the sky from nearby explosions, while men shouted trying to gain advantage over the enemy. All manner of soldiers descended upon the final battle, as Americans and Africans, both white and black, met Wehrmacht, Schutzstaffel, and Mercenaries in this final stand, some only leaving bones behind in the aftermath of the gunfire and decimation. However, eventually, the Germans broke, after the frigid African night descended upon them, and it was only then that the compound remained vulnerable.\n\nHowever, as light descends upon a world of sin, so too does the rising sun bathe the men of war. No longer was the African continent plagued with a German plague. Finally, victory had been achieved, with no Reichskommissar to say otherwise, with everyone drearily enchanted with thoughts of the future."

They offer an armistice, keeping Südwestafrika, lower Mozambique and Southern Rhodesia but nothing more. And otherwise engaging in a total cessation of hostilities.\n\nDespite our public confidence in the direction the war is taking, the reality is that we are unlikely to be capable of retaking the occupied colonies, let alone advancing substantially into South African territories. Voices amongst our militarist echelons advise that should we continue fighting for much longer it is entirely possible that our forces collapse in their entirety, which would not technically be a loss for the Reich so much as it would be a complete and utterly catastrophe for our international prestige.\n\nShould we accept this offer though it would be a recognition of defeat for the Reich, something that comes with its own issues.

At first glance it would seem to be a loss for the Reich, but despite the concerted efforts of our forces in Africa we have been unable to substantially penetrate OFN lines, a swift exit to save face could be useful if we should desire to refocus our efforts upon targets closer to home.\n\nThere may be those who see this as cowardly, but we can point to the fact that whilst we have not gained anything of substance from this South African War neither have we lost anything worth mentioning, some inbred Afrikaners and a few Native SS detachments who likely would not be useful beyond the wars conclusion anyhow. Additionally, this war has reminded the world that for all the Americans claim to be the king, the Reich can strike with equal ferocity.\n\nIt is not up to the Führer to decide whether we shall accept this proffered ceasefire, or continue the fight in the hopes of a true victory?"

The more militant amongst our ranks would have the war continue until the entire nation of South Africa is under occupation but we must concede that such an operation would be expensive and quite possibly beyond our current capabilities in terms of occupying troops.\n\nTherefore it falls to the Führer to decide whether we shall accept this rather generous offer, or go all in to secure a victory for the Reich that will be remembered for decades to come."

 SAFWAR.24.d:0 "When Boers, Germans, Americans and Native Africans of a hundred peoples clashed it seemed a war destined to end quickly. Instead of a swift victory however all the tens of thousands of men sent to fight in Africa found was mud, blood and the endless heat. For the longest time victory seemed an impossible proposition, as in the desert of Namibia, the Mozambique forests and dusty plains of Xhosa young men struggled and died for reasons they knew not why.\n\nBut with valor and sacrifice the South Africans and their allies in the Organization of Free Nations advanced forwards, seizing territories once held under the grip of the Reich and giving those who lived there a taste of something they thought lost years ago, hope. The Germans, recognizing that further conflict would gain them nought, negotiated a ceasefire and at last, after so long fighting and dying, the young men of Africa return to their homes. But on the international scale, the bloodied Germans and heartened OFN merely prepare for the next clash."

In the jungles, in the deserts, on the savannahs and by the rivers.\n\nSo many have died now that the Organization of Free Nations and Afrika-Schild both have decided that war shall end with no loss of territory for any party, no more unnecessary deaths, no more fighting. Hundreds upon thousands bled and died for this achievement, the conclusion of things as they were before, without a change to be seen from above. But the ruined lives of those affected will echo for generations.\n\nBut this is not the end, the OFN and the Germans ready for the next battle, one which might be more conclusive."

Now the Germans stand, not triumphant but at the least satisfied with their efforts, for a ceasefire has been accepted wherein the OFN will withdraw somewhat from the northern reaches of South Africa in return for the states continued existence.\n\nThe Germans celebrate this, but in the halls of the Reichskommissars there is now the intrigue of victory and blaming for losses going around.

We must be careful of course, we might overstate our position somewhat and should try to ensure that the next time we offer a ceasefire that the Schild will accept it.\n\nOr, if we are so inclined we could attempt to push for an utter victory, with no ceasefire and no German influence left upon the African continent."

We shall bloody them, kill them, and next time we offer the mercy of ceasefire they shall be forced to accept.\n\nOf course, should we be successful enough it is entirely possible that the need for a ceasefire will be rendered utterly moot, we can only pray that this shall be the case.

The initial report by the CIA had been hours ago, and the rest of the world had already been notified of the South African government's surrender and dissolution. Normally, after a moment to process news like this, he was fine, ready to face the world and all of its inhabitants. Now though? He couldn't stand to face the television, much less anyone else. That's why he was alone in the White House's rose garden. He hadn't even seen Joyce since then.\n\nHe had been dealt a bad hand. Everyone knew that, even the press was calling him \"unfortunate\" rather than \"incompetent\", a luxury that he knew he'd only have until the next cycle came about, and the NPP's dogs were allowed off their leash following the expected grieving period. But it was true, all the same. The impeachment, the assassination, could it all have happened at a worse time? The last election they'd be riding high, and now here they were, at the end of just another crippling disaster to follow the last three.\n\nOf course, would this have happened under another President? Under Nixon or Kennedy's watch? That's what they'd be asking at the end of the day, and in truth, it's what he should be wondering too. If it had been just one of them before all of this, at least the other half of the establishment could pick up the slack. One disaster could've been recovered from with ease, but this was a catastrophe that affected the Republicans and Democrats with near-equal effectiveness.\n\nAs long as there had been Republicans and Democrats, every American President was either, and as much as John McCormack tried to push it out of his mind, he couldn't help but wonder if there would be another one. If he were a strategist with the NPP right about now, he'd be salivating over what this meant for the RDC.\n\nAs fresh as the wounds were though, the past was the past, and now was no time to sulk. He bent down to a particularly bright red rose in the bush, and took a brief sniff of it, enjoying the fragrance, before closing his eyes and steeling himself. He had a press conference to go to, and an American people to reassure. He couldn't give them victory, but if he played his cards right, this wouldn't keep them down for long."

The historicity of the moment was overwhelming, to the point that President John McCormack almost couldn't hear General Westmoreland on the other end of the line.\n\n\"...And to tell you the truth, that was the absolute last of organized German resistance.\" Westmoreland didn't sound at ease. Pleased? For certain. But definitely not at ease. \"As for the locals, well... That's a fight that's just beginning.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course.\" That was John's own space-filling method, when he needed a second to catch up to what William was saying. The locals, right. \"We have an obligation here. They are free, but if we just leave now, it will just leave a power vacuum across the entire continent, to such a point that maybe the Germans would find a way to slip back in in all that mess.\"\n\nThen his mind shifted right back to the home front. So much had happened during the war. The impeachment, the assassination, his own swearing in as President. What stroke of fortune allowed them to win under these circumstances anyways? The organization at the top of it all had never been this disorganized, in many wars, that was as good as a death sentence. But here they were, standing atop the smoldering remains of three dismantled German colonies and a freed continent.\n\nWestmoreland was not privy to his ruminations, so he just kept talking about business. \"I get that. I'm not saying we need to pull out, but we're going to need to put some serious thought into this. The mid-war plans just aren't enough. We got nearly three million square miles of land to deal with, and God knows how many people.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course.\" The President reassured the general. \"We can and will revise the old plans, draft up new ones if need be.\" He couldn't quite get himself past the realization that they had won. He had won. In what universe did John W. McCormack preside over a victorious war? The liberation of an entire continent? It was beyond belief, even to himself. It was hard to discuss such serious matters of state while one felt like they were in a dream instead, after all.\n\n\"Well, we'd better.

My soldiers - and others in the OFN - died for your country, de Graaff. Don't dare insult their sacrifices.\"\n\n\"I-\" de Graaff sighed deeply, closing his eyes. \"I apologize.

Wallace Bennett poured over page after page of newsprint; watched hour after hour of nightly news. The war in Africa had come to a close, but the war for his legacy was just beginning. He had negotiated a white peace in Nixon's endless war, a feat that he was quite proud of, but one he feared the American public would mistake for weakness. Unfortunately, it would be exceptionally unpresidential to fire the opening salvos in such a war of historical narrative, and so he was forced to sit at the Resolute Desk and read.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the peace was a \"necessary and mature conclusion to an unnecessary and immature war\". Walter Cronkite assented, but the Wall Street Journal disagreed. In the eyes of the Journal, Bennett had \"betrayed African democracy, and allowed the fascist dogs of the Afrika-Schild to continue to run their inhumane fiefdoms\". Still, the Journal had been against him from the word \"go\"; they would accept no less than Ludwig von Mises himself in the Oval Office.\n\nAfter nearly a full three days of channel surfing and funny pages, Bennett was forced to accept the unexpected reality of the situation: America was behind him. Against his every expectation, the average American was happy to see an end to the war, even if that end was a simple return to the status quo. Mothers were overjoyed to see their sons; sisters, their brothers. More than that, the OFN had set out to defend South Africa, and sure as rain, South Africa was free. The war had been costly and unpopular. Any end to it was welcome, let alone an end that accomplished the original goals. According to some intelligent-but-overbearing RD analysts, the peace actually was giving Bennett a notable polling boost. According to them, it proved he was a \"skilled diplomat, dedicated to world peace\".\n\nClearly, the white peace was going over swimmingly with the American people. Either way, an occupation of all of continental Africa would have been... costly. On the whole, the expected \"war for his legacy\" had already been won!

The United States had undergone significant domestic unrest over the course of the South African War, but South Africa had undergone a full blown civil war. In Bennett's eyes, however, the unrest was all in the past. The war was over.\n\n\"A kick to the pants indeed. I can imagine Han Hüttig with that ridiculous haircut screaming at his cronies until he's red in the face! Masters of Europe, perhaps, but certainly not masters of Africa!

De Graaff, for his part, seemed pleased that the President was bursting with passion, and passed him the small box.\n\n\"It's a personal gift from me to you.\" Bennett opened the box. Inside was a small vial of dirt, attached to a note that read 'With Love, From Inverness'. \"I know the gift of dirt may seem unorthodox, but please allow me to explain myself. I served in the Second World War, and I was decorated for my actions during the defense of the Home Isles. As I evacuated out of Inverness onto some overcrowded American destroyer, I scooped a pile of dirt from the Scottish soil, and resolved to return it when Europe was inevitably freed from fascist. At the outbreak of the Schild intervention, I did the same thing with some dirt just outside of my family home in Tygerberg. Thanks to OFN intervention, my nation has weathered the Schild intervention, and I have returned the soil to Tygerberg. The soil in that vial is the same soil I took from Inverness.

The reporters held their questions, waiting for him to give his opening speech.\n\n\"Good morning,\" he opened. \"I am pleased to share that we have negotiated a ceasefire with the Afrika-Schild, and brought about an end to the war in South Africa. We have prevented the last light of democracy in Africa from being extinguished, and dealt a crippling blow to German aggression.\"\n\nThe reporters immediately began asking questions. \"Mr. President,\" one said. \"Was anything gained in the negotiations, or was the agreement only for a ceasefire?\"\n\n\"Let me remind you of why we were involved in this war,\" Kennedy said, lifting a hand. \"We answered the call to protect an ally from being invaded by an enemy. We did not go to conquer, but protect. We did exactly what we set out to do.\"\n\nA few more questions followed, and he answered them deftly, before pointing at a woman in the back who spoke. \"President Kennedy, with no significant changes to the borders, is it possible that the Germans may once again try to attack South Africa?\"\n\n\"The Germans threw everything they had into this conquest,\" Kennedy answered. \"They are weak, their morale is broken, and they have to contend with their own domestic issues. I assure you, we have nothing to fear from a repeated invasion.\"\n\nThe press conference continued for a while yet, as Kennedy continued answering questions. At the end of the day, this outcome wouldn't overly help or hurt him, and for that, he supposed, it was something to be grateful for. Africa may still be under the shadow of the Reich - but at least there remained yet a torch of liberty in it."

 saw_report.26.desc: "Robert F. Kennedy found that even his critics had found nothing to protest about the results of the South African War. Simply keeping the Germans at bay had been the expectation of most, and they had not only achieved that, but been able to dictate terms to the Germans. He was going to make sure the nation heard it.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he began at the press conference that was packed with reporters and media outlets. \"We have finished the dictation of terms to the Afrika-Schild, which they have accepted. The South African War is over, they are in the process of integrating the newly liberated territories.\"\n\nThere was applause at the declaration, and all of them seemed happy. It was good to be on the winning side - and there were tangible wins here. It was not a return to the status quo, but as Kennedy saw it, the beginning of the inevitable collapse of the German presence in Africa. \"Mr. President,\" a reporter asked. \"With the gains that were able to be made, why did we agree to any ceasefire terms? Should we not have liberated all the continent from German tyranny?\"\n\nThat had been the most sustained complaint he'd heard - which was that he should have done more. \"Our mission was to support our ally in their time of need,\" Kennedy answered. \"That is what we did, and far more. While it is unfortunate that there remain people under German tyranny, I cannot in good conscience send our people in uniform to continue fighting and dying for an uncertain end.\"\n\nSeeing an opportunity, he elaborated. \"To continue, and take the German place in Africa, even if we had achieved this, would be an incalculable burden upon America, and a responsibility that, in the end, is simply not worth the loss of time, men, and resources. Make no mistake - the German control over Africa is weakening, and I am certain that we will see their liberation soon.\""

Anyone who even paid the slightest bit of attention would see this for what it was - a defeat. Not a catastrophic one, South Africa still endured, and hadn't been completely overrun. It was a small consolation.\n\n\"Good morning,\" he opened. \"I am pleased to report that a ceasefire has been signed to bring the South African War to an end. Through the brave sacrifices of our servicemen, the light of democracy in Africa still burns, and our mission has been accomplished.\"\n\nThe questions immediately began. \"President Kennedy, how can you say the mission was accomplished when South Africa has been forced to cede territory to the Germans and Boers?\"\n\n\"I will remind everyone what our mission was,\" Kennedy said, knowing the answer would not be convincing. \"It was to defend South Africa from the invasion of a foreign power, and the fact of the matter is that South Africa still stands.\"\n\nAnother burst of questions arose. \"Mr. President, can you articulate exactly what our soldiers died for in this lost war?\"\n\n\"It was not a lost war,\" Kennedy pushed back. \"It did not end in our favor, but it was not lost. Prolonging the war would have only resulted in more of our soldiers dead, and that was something I considered carefully when making the decision. But I reject that our soldiers died for nothing - they died in defense of democracy. They died fighting the evil of the German Reich, and ensured that a bastion of hope in Africa was not extinguished.\"\n\nIt wasn't going to convince most people, but it might mollify some of them. Kennedy braced himself as the questions continued, and resigned himself to the fact that the best he could do here was not sway the public to his side, but only limit the damage."

We have defeated the Afrika-Schild, and with it, the shadow over the continent has been lifted. We are victorious, and the South African War is over.\"\n\nWhere crowds gathered to watch the address, they broke into cheers and celebrations across the country began. There were many reasons to celebrate the victory, not just for democracy, but by dealing a significant blow against Germany and fascism across the world.\n\n\"To prevent the continent from falling into anarchy,\" Kennedy continued. \"The Organization of Free Nations has begun the process of establishing Mandates in the continent, which will exist to transition the continent to democracies, and prevent unnecessary power vacuums and violence.\"\n\n\"For decades, Africa has suffered,\" Kennedy finished. \"Under the Reich, and under colonialism.

His notes were scattered on the table, along with the final reports from the war. But he couldn't concentrate on them long enough; he couldn't format a coherent train of thought to address this, especially to the media who were waiting to pick him apart.\n\nFor once, they might be right.\n\nIt was difficult to look at the numbers from the reports. An uncountable number of lives had been lost. Numerous American soldiers had been returned in coffins. Still more bodies were abandoned and left to rot in the baking African sun. The last bastion of democracy in Africa had been extinguished. The dark continent had grown darker. Everyone was looking for someone to blame.\n\nMost had chosen him.\n\nMaybe it was unfair. He hadn't started the war, he hadn't made the decision to intervene, but no one could say that he hadn't picked up the mantle when he'd become President and try to win. The war had become his, and how many men, how much money, how many resources had been poured into the conflict? It had all been for nothing.\n\nHe had nothing to show for it.\n\nAll of his enemies were sharpening their knives or wasting no time in attacking him. The RDC must have been privately thrilled, and he knew this defeat would haunt not just him, but the NPP for a very long time.

 SAF_USA.1.desc: "The Nixon White House was defined by chaos. As phone line operators were overwhelmed by the sheer number of calls going to and from the White House, aides and staffers scrambled to form a cohesive image of what was happening across the Atlantic. Was Durban already about to fall to the Afrika-Schild, or was the press just fear-mongering? Was Hüttig receiving assistance from the Burgundian SS, or was this just another rumor?\n\nAs the Executive Branch quickly shuffled into the Cabinet Room, Nixon watched them from the corner of his eye as he leaned forward in his chair, his right hand gripping a telephone as he listened to the other end. Kennedy unbuttoned his suit as he collapsed into a seat across from Nixon, with McNamara seating himself to the President's right. As the room waited in silence, Nixon finally concluded the phone call.\n\n\"Mhm. Tell Klein to deal with the press. And remind him that I'm cutting his staff in half.\" Slamming the telephone down, Nixon straightened his posture before resting his arms on the mahogany conference table, papers scattered across it. Drawing a deep breath, Nixon began the meeting. \"At this point, we can't, uh, not intervene. The situation isn't perfect, and we ought to find a way to send in the military before the—the Nazis, uh, crush the South Africans.\" Nixon scoured the room for affirmation, seeing his cabinet respond only with tepid whispers of agreement.\n\nAwkwardly adjusting himself in his seat, Nixon cleared his throat before continuing. \"Get, uh, get every OFN diplomat on the line. I want them in New York within six hours.\" Quietly, the cabinet exchanged glances before dismissing themselves. Nixon, however, had already decided what'd happen before the meeting began, and he was relieved when it ended."

The lights above slowly burned the OFN delegations as they whispered among themselves, tensely waiting for orders on how to vote on Security Resolution 13. Then, Richard Nixon emerged, and all eyes locked on him. Taking his seat at the table, he prepared the papers in his hand, swallowing before speaking into the microphone.\n\n\"Let me point out that this meeting helps unite our alliance and serves as a visible demonstration that the Organization of Free Nations remains behind her commitment to a free world,\" Nixon began. \"We are the remaining free nations of the world. Our defeat and humiliation in World War II promoted recklessness in the councils of those powers who have not yet abandoned their goals of world conquest. And so, the defense of freedom is everybody's business—not just America's business.\"\n\n\"We cannot stand aloof and leave the fate of South Africa to the Boer rebellion and Afrika-Schild. We must stand ready in the face of Nazi aggression. To pass Security Resolution 13 means that we finally have in sight the stand for freedom we have been seeking these past decades. Thank you.\" The delegations and spectators exchanged glances as the words set in and the room's anxiety subsided. An ear-blistering standing ovation followed.\n\nNixon, too, felt his anxiety subside. The vote was unanimous—hell, even Brazil ratified the resolution. There wasn't a goddamn chance that the Nazis put down their arms and withdrew within 24 hours—perfect. Not even Herblock and every bastard at the Post or the Times could somehow spin it into a failure. If the Free World could make its stand, '64 would be a breeze."

It had been a rough two weeks. Every order he received was incoherent, and all the intelligence relayed to him turned out to be bogus. Hell- he'd led his men into the savannah and nearly engaged a South African platoon until they identified themselves. The sergeant's daydreaming ended when the headline caught his attention.\n\n\"OFN passes Security Resolution 14,\" he read aloud to the rest of the tent. \"Some good fucking news for once. Maybe they'll let us burn these krauts alive next.\" The tent exchanged glances, some taking the news as a sign from God, others simply not caring. Private Wood, stretched out on his cot, stiffly turned his head toward the sergeant and opened his mouth.\n\n\"What's 'Security Resolution 14'?\" Freeman skimmed through the newspaper before looking up, his hawkish gaze locking onto the private's.\n\n\"Sets up a single command structure instead of letting every one of our fucking allies run this shitshow their own way,\" the sergeant barked. Reading through the newspaper once again, he adjusted himself before continuing. \"Says here that Westmoreland's supposed to be leading it. They gave him some fancy title, 'Supreme Allied Commander'.\" He let out a chuckle before finally topping it off. \"And, it makes everyone use the OFN flag when fighting the krauts.\"\n\nWood's eyes drifted to the tent's ceiling as he released a long, exaggerated sigh. \"As long as it wins us this war faster,\" he began with his distinct magnolia accent. \"Can't take half measures no more.

The weight had nearly broken him, but now was not the time to give up nor voice his reservations about South Africa.\n\nBall, now with the Security Council, leaned forward in the chair, his hands clasped together as they rested on the round table. The words \"UNITED STATES\" were displayed proudly on the nameplate that hung off the end as conversations echoed throughout the chamber. He tapped his foot on the floor, and when the session finally began and cameras trained onto him, he drew a deep breath.\n\n\"In many major capitals, there are already signs of deep concern at the present state of the refugee crisis,\" Ball said into the microphone sternly. \"Our joint and sole aim is to secure and maintain the political independence and territorial integrity of South Africa. But,\" Ball began as he gripped a Washington Post article, lifting it in the air for all to see, \"we must also be willing to assist the people that have experienced the horrors of Nazism directly.\"\n\nPointing to the photograph on the front page of an African family marching through the exhausting savannah to escape the bloodshed, Ball continued. \"Tens of thousands of refugees have already crossed the border, and that number will grow. We must consider a major effort by all of us to deliver economic and humanitarian aid to South Africa.\" Ball's words were met with approval as the delegations nodded to each other, and when the voting began, they all cast 'aye' without hesitation."

He stared at the briefing in front of him, his fists clenched as they rested on the Resolute Desk. He concentrated all his attention on the words printed on the paper. The noises had nearly faded into the background before Haldeman stepped into the room, and everything Nixon tried to forget rushed back to the front of his mind. Haldeman stared at Nixon for a moment, choosing his words carefully.\n\n\"They're protesting the war, sir.\" Even as Haldeman spoke in his most soothing voice, it could not stop Nixon from taking it personally. Processing the words as fury emerged behind his eyes, Nixon stood up in disbelief before sending a stack of papers flying across the room.\n\n\"Bullshit!\" Nixon exploded as any restraint he might've had vanished. \"They're protesting a goddamn war against Nazis?\" Haldeman opened his mouth to answer despite knowing the question was rhetorical. He couldn't get a word out before Nixon continued to seethe. \"What the hell is the matter with those bastards! I mean, are they out of their goddamn minds?\" Haldeman interjected, quickly correcting himself.\n\n\"No, sir—they're demonstrating in favor of the war. They want you to escalate it.\" Nixon subdued himself, standing like a deer in headlights. Collapsing into his chair, he rested his chin in his hand as curiosity washed over him.

The President drew a deep breath as he looked into the camera lens, and for a moment, he saw America looking back at him.\n\n\"Good evening, my fellow Americans. Tonight I want to talk to you on a subject of deep concern to all Americans and to many people in all parts of the world—the war in South Africa.\" He forced the words out of his mouth, having paced the White House at night, restless as he tormented himself over the speech's content. \"The war is necessary to continue. It is not the easy choice, but it is the right choice. Allowing South Africans' future to be determined by the victor of a military contest between themselves and the Boer rebellion, alongside the Afrika-Schild, would be a betrayal of our allies.\"\n\nHe paused, assuming a gentle tone before continuing. \"I considered the question of what choices we have if we are to end the war, and so, I have chosen to proclaim a national emergency concerning South Africa. This policy will help the war effort by allowing further mobilization of our military personnel and allowing the administration to direct the production of war materials.\"\n\n\"With the confidence of our allies and confidence in ourselves, we will defend South Africa's freedom from Nazi aggression. If we succeed, generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moment, that we helped make the world safe for mankind.

It's hard on us all, but we can only focus on the happy little things, every chance we get.\" The medic gestured to the vista. \"This... is my escape from it all. I have always loved views like these, even when I was stationed in Alaska... as a matter of fact, I've something to show you all.\" As the medic rooted around in a wide, rectangular bag tucked alongside a boulder, Walters recomposed herself.\n\n\"I see... why do you like these mountains so much, exactly, mister...?\" Pulling a wide canvas out of his bag, the soldier's face seemed painted with pride.\n\n\"Please, call me Bob, and... well, look around.
