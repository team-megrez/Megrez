 HND_backwards_economy_2_desc: "이 나라는 농업에 의존하고 있으며, 그 방법도 시대에 뒤쳐졌습니다. 그러나 산업화가 도시 지역에서 점점 더 진행되면서 상황이 서서히 변화하기 시작했습니다."

 HND_divided_government_desc: "캘커타 정부 내에는 최대주의자, 온건주의자, 농업주의자의 세 파벌이 있습니다. 각각 내전 중에 함께 싸웠으나, 비록 그들이 모두 같은 정부의 일부라 할지라도 사회주의 인도가 어떻게 될 것인가에 대한 각자의 목표와 비전을 가지고  경쟁하고 있습니다. 내분이 때로는 극심해질 수도 있고, 분열이 결국 공개적인 갈등으로 이어질 수도 있다는 우려도 있습니다."

 HND_vanguardist_1_desc: "최대주의파의 수장인 수바스 찬드라 보스가 캘커타 정부수반으로 지명되었습니다."
 HND_speech_war: "'우리는 패배하지 않을 것이다'"
 HND_speech_war_desc: "보세의 첫번째 지시가 전국에 전해질 것입니다 - 전체주의자들은 다음 몇 년 동안 코뮌의 발전을 위해 강경한 노선을 취하리라 생각됩니다. 보세가 생각하기에, 바라트 코뮌은 해외의 도움 없이도 자신의 이권을 확보하고 군을 현대화할 능력이 충분합니다. 다만 믿을 수 없는 만큼의 대가가 따르겠지요."
 HND_revoke_landlords: "지주제 폐지"
 HND_revoke_landlords_desc: "혁명 이전에는 인도에서 흔히 볼 수 있던 지주들이 이후 모두 없어진 것은 아닙니다. 사실 많은 소규모 농장들은 여전히 캘커타 정부가 자신들에 손댈 수 없다고 믿는 카스트 상류층의 부유한 자들에 의해 운영되고 있습니다. 최대주의파는 그들이 믿는 바가 틀렸음을 증명할 작정입니다. 그리고 국가의 모든 농장은 그곳에서 일하는 사람들의 공동 지배와 통치 속에서 운영되어야 합니다."
 HND_nationalize_industry: "주요 산업 조직"
 HND_nationalize_industry_desc: "국가의 주요 산업 대부분이 국유화 되어 있지만, 내전의 참화로 인해 여전히 아쉬운 상태에 머물러 있습니다. 정부는 군이 절실히 필요로 하는 지원을 할 수 있도록 생산성을 회복하고 관리를 활성화 하는데 주력해야 합니다."
 HND_mass_conscription: "대중 자극"
 HND_mass_conscription_desc: "바라트 코뮌의 인민들에게 다음과 같은 요구가 울려퍼져야 합니다: 전쟁에 대비하라. 모든 인민은 남녀를 불문하고 식민주의와 그들의 압제에 맞서 싸울 준비가 되어야 한다. 희생의 대가가 아무리 크더라도 기쁘게 그 대가를 치뤄야 한다. 인도의 자유는 우리의 피로서 실현될 것이다. 이 외에는 방법이 없다. 하지만 코뮌은 여기서 피를 거의 흘리지 않을 것이다."
 HND_purge_army: "숙청 시작"
 HND_purge_army_desc: "너무 많은 장교들이 한때 구질서의 왕족이었고, 그들이 코뮌에 대해 가지고 있는 충성심은 매우 의심스럽습니다. 곧 그들이 요구할 것들이 가져올 위험은 우리가 감당할 수 없으며, 그들의 특권은 단호히 없어져야만 합니다. 그 대가는 심각하겠지만, 어쩔 수 없습니다."
 HND_rebuild_army: "새로운 군대가 떠오른다"
 HND_rebuild_army_desc: "군 숙청이 모두 완료되었으니, 자리를 다시 새롭게 채울 자례입니다. 그리고 승진한 장교들이 모두 최대주의파의 대의에 충성하도록 해야 합니다."
 HND_ready_people: "총력전은 우리에게 있다"
 HND_ready_people_desc: "코뮌에 사는 국민들은 반드시 충성심을 가져야 합니다. 이는 국가에 대한 충성일 뿐 아니라, 최대주의에 대한 충성이기도 하죠. 우리가 걸어야 하는 길은 힘든 길이지만, 스스로를 '온건파' 또는 '평화주의자'라 부르는 자들과 손을 잡고, 그들에게 결정권을 부여하는 일은 있어서는 안됩니다."
 HND_syndicalist_1: "A.K. 파즈룰 후크"
 HND_syndicalist_1_desc: "온건파의 지도자 압둘 카젬 파즈룰 후크(A. K. Fazlul Huq)는 캘커타 정부 수반으로 임명되었습니다."
 HND_speech_industry: "'산업은 승리를 향한 길이다'"
 HND_speech_industry_desc: "후크와 네루가 연설한 주요 내용은 다음과 같습니다 - 온건주의자들은 국가의 발전에 있어 현실적이고 점진적인 접근을 취할 것입니다. 산업의 발전을 이룩하고, 부당한 정책을 개혁하고, 사회 변화 속도를 촉진시키는 데 집중할 것입니다. 전국의 많은 사람들은 이를 통해 안도의 한숨을 쉴 수 있을 것입니다."
 HND_spread_revolution: "혁명 전파"
 HND_spread_revolution_desc: "성장에 대한 온건한 접근은 여전히 코뮌을 호시탐탐 노리고 있는 식민주의 세력과 그들의 압제에 항복하는 것이 아닙니다. 그 목적을 달성하기 위해, 북쪽과 서쪽에서 조용히 활동을 개진하고, 곧 운동 개시를 준비하고 있는 혁명가들에게 접근해야 합니다."
 HND_create_raw: "연구 및 분석"
 HND_create_raw_desc: "지식은 우리의 가장 큰 무기입니다. 즉 우리의 적들이 무엇을 하는지 알게 하고, 그들을 잘못된 정보로 속일 수 있는 능력입니다. 이를 위해, 아대륙과 그 너머에서 우리의 정보 입수 능력을 늘리고자 새로운 군단에 자금 지원이 이뤄질 것입니다."
 HND_production_focus: "생산 집중"
 HND_production_focus_desc: "코뮌의 산업을 발전시키려는 온건주의자들의 계획의 일환으로, 현금과 건설 프로젝트를 얻고자 몇몇 거주 단지가 지정되었습니다."
 HND_technology_focus: "기술 집중"
 HND_technology_focus_desc: "온건주의자들은 질이 양보다 중요하다고 말합니다. 바라트 코뮌은 무엇보다 기술에 초점을 밪춰 유럽에서도 가장 발전된 나라들과 동등한 수준을 이루어야 합니다. 이는 유일한 승리의 길입니다."
 HND_arm_soldiers: "군대 무장"
 HND_arm_soldiers_desc: "코뮌에는 대규모 군대가 있지만, 그렇게 많은 병사를 배치하는 것은 어려운 일입니다. 많은 조정과 게획이 필요할 것입니다."
 HND_seek_aid: "해외의 위대한 인물들 초청"
 HND_seek_aid_desc: "우리는 홀로 움직일 수 없습니다. 만일 우리가 높은 수준의 연구와 기술을 얻으려면, 전 세계 사회주의 국가들로부터 가장 능력 있는 사람들을 초청하여 과학자들과 긴밀히 협력해야 합니다."
 HND_socialist_1: "모한다스 카람찬드 간디"
 HND_socialist_1_desc: "농업주의자들의 지도자인 모한다스 카람찬드 간디가 캘커타 정부 수반으로 임명되었습니다."
 HND_speech_peace: "'인도의 평화를 위한 길이 있다'"
 HND_speech_peace_desc: "간디는 국민들에게 다음과 같이 첫 연설을 했습니다 - 바라트 코뮌은 군부에 의해 통치되는 것이 아니라 무엇보다도 국민과 그들의 자유를 우선시하려는 정부에 의해 통치되어야 합니다. 마하트마는 인도에서 가장 존경받는 인물이며, 그의 말은 사람들을 기쁘게 할 것입니다."
 HND_path_of_defense: "방어 중점"
 HND_path_of_defense_desc: "힘은 자유를 받치고 있는 것들 중 하나입니다. 코뮌을 책임지고 있는 농업주의자들에 역시, 적들만을 바라보고 기회만 있다면 적들을 주저히지 않고 없애버리려 하는 자들이 있습니다. 농업주의자들은 국민들이 압제자로부터 저항할 것을, 정부와 정부의 노력에 지지를 보내 줄 것을, 마하트마가 평화와 자유의 길로 인도하리라 확신할 것을 촉구할 것입니다."
 HND_people_first: "인도인이 먼저다"
 HND_people_first_desc: "농업주의자들이 가장 중요시하는 것은, 인도의 빈민들의 복지를 개혁하는 것입니다. 그들이 더 나은 삶을 살 수 있도록 정부의 희생이 필요합니다. 간디가 말했듯이, 코뮌은 이들의 절망적인 영혼 없이는 승리를 이룰 수 없습니다."
 HND_home_guard: "국민방위대 창설"
 HND_home_guard_desc: "슬프게도, 토후 연방과 자치령 정부와의 평화는 말로만 이뤄질 수는 없을 것입니다. 그들은 이성에 귀를 기울이지 않을 것입니다. 따라서, 코뮌의 군대 안에서 평화를 유지하는 것 뿐만 아니라 방어에 초점을 맞추는 새로운 파벌을 찾아야 합니다. 북쪽과 서쪽에 있는 배신자들이 오게 된다면, 그들은 우리의 엄청난 저항에 직면할 것이며, 우리가 반드시 그들의 살점을 떼어버릴 것을 알아야만 합니다."
 HND_approach_enemy: "평화를 위한 적과의 접촉"
 HND_approach_enemy_desc: "It is possible that reunion with the other factions in India could be achieved. Most important is the government in Lahore - if they will listen to the Mahatma's words and agree to a summit, one without their British masters in attendance, then the Princely Federation will follow. Whether such an achievement is even possible remains to be seen."
 HND_reunite_india: "러크나우 정상회담 시작"
 HND_reunite_india_desc: "The Lahore and Calcutta governments have agreed to a summit in Lucknow, with the slimmest of chances that it might result in a peaceful union. There are forces already stirring within the Commune in stark opposition to this plan, but the Mahatma believes it can be done... and, if peace is possible, then it must be done."
 HND_reform_army: "코뮌군 개혁"
 HND_reform_army_desc: "지역 방위군을 두는 것만으로는 충분치 않습니다. 이미 코뮌군 내부에는 농본파를 염려하는 세력이 있으며, 마하트마가 코뮌군에 공격을 명령하지 않는다 하더라도, 그 세력들이 북쪽과 서쪽을 향한 전쟁을 밀어붙이고 있습니다. 캘커타의 최대주의파를 자극할지라도, 그들을 찾아내어 단호히 제거해야 합니다."
 HND_end_the_debate: "국가적인 논쟁의 종료"
 HND_end_the_debate_desc: "캘커타 정부 내에는 항상 갈등이 있겠지만, 이제 끝없는 싸움을 종식시켜야 합니다. 바라트 코뮌이 인도를 통합하려면 세 정파가 모두 손을 잡고 공동의 목표를 향해 나아가야만 합니다."
 HND_new_industry: "새로운 산업"
 HND_new_industry_desc: "우리의 산업은 아직 많이 부족합니다. 우리는 공장을 위한 새로운 설계도를 찾고 연구하는데 집중해야 합니다."
 HND_railroad_1: "국립 철도 확장"
 HND_railroad_1_desc: "코뮌의 기반 시설을 확장하는 것은 우리 경제를 재건하고 산업 성장을 지속하기 위한 첫번째 단계입니다."
 HND_railroad_2: "국립 철도 확장 II"
 HND_railroad_2_desc: "국가의 기반 시설은 계속 확장되어야 합니다. 국가 회복을 위한 첫번째 단계라 할 수 있습니다."
 HND_mining: "국립 광산 확장"
 HND_mining_desc: "바라트 코뮌은 풍부한 천연자원을 보유하고 있습니다. 우리는 이들을 이용하기 위해 새로운 채굴법을 받아들여야 합니다."
 HND_assam_oil: "아삼 석유"
 HND_assam_oil_desc: "최근 아삼의 국경 지역을 연구한 결과, 아직 개발되지 않은 석유가 매장되어 있다는 사실이 밝혀졌습니다. 인도는 결코 세계 최대의 석유 생산국 중 하나는 될 수 없을 것입니다. 하지만 이는 우리 군대와 산업에 필수적인 자원임일 것입니다."
 HND_indian_elites: "벵골 지식인 문제"
 HND_indian_elites_desc: "코뮌의 발전에 걸림돌이 되는 것 중에 하나는 구 사회 질서의 잔재입니다. 엘리트 계급은 예전처럼 부유하거나 강력하지는 않지만, 그들이 가진 것들을 여전히 고수하고 있고, 인민이나 정부와 잉여물을 나누기를 거부합니다. 우리는 진정으로 성장을 시작하기 전에, 가능하다면 그들을 어떻게 우리의 통제 하에 둘지 결정해야 합니다."
 HND_civ_industry_1: "민간산업 개발"
 HND_civ_industry_1_desc: "새로운 기술로 무장한 우리는 전국에 공장을 지을 수 있게 되었습니다."
 HND_civ_industry_2: "민간산업 개발 지속"
 HND_civ_industry_2_desc: "우리는 인민들을 위해 민간 공장을 계속해서 건설해야 합니다."
 HND_mil_industry_1: "군수산업 개발"
 HND_mil_industry_1_desc: "우리의 군수 공장은 현재 부족합니다. 우리는 공장들을 확장하는데 모든 노력을 바쳐야 합니다."
 HND_mil_industry_2: "군수산업 개발 지속"
 HND_mil_industry_2_desc: "군수 물품의 생산량은 늘었지만, 북부의 연방과 토후 연방에 비할 정도는 아닙니다. 생산을 계속해서 늘려나가야 합니다."
 HND_new_economy: "경제가 회복되었다!"
 HND_new_economy_desc: "마침내, 우리는 내전으로 인해 파괴된 경제를 회복했고, 이제 진정으로 우리의 적들을 공격할 능력을 가진 신흥 산업국이라 스스로를 부를 수 있게 되었습니다."
 HND_army_research: "연구부"
 HND_army_research_desc: "우리의 연구 능력을 향상시키는데 주력하는 부서를 군 내에 건설할 때입니다."
 HND_radio: "라디오 기술 개발"
 HND_radio_desc: "라디오 기술은 세계의 어느 곳에서든 최전방과 실시간 통신을 가능케하는 경이로운 기술입니다. 우리는 라디오 기술을 지배하기 위해 노력을 기울여야 합니다."
 HND_electronics_1: "전자공학 개발"
 HND_electronics_1_desc: "레이다와 컴퓨터의 출현은 향후 코뮌의 군사적인 행동에 필수적입니다."
 HND_expand_research: "연구팀 확장"
 HND_expand_research_desc: "세계의 다른 나라들이 우리의 과학자들을 앞지르고 있습니다. 우리는 더 많은 과학자들을 모아 일을 시켜야 합니다. 다가올 도전에 대처하기 위해서죠."
 HND_rocketry: "로켓 기술 개발"
 HND_rocketry_desc: "인도가 다시 뭉쳤으니, 전쟁의 미래를 받아들여야 합니다: 우리 항공기에 동력을 공급할 수 있을 뿐 아니라 가장 파괴적인 무기들을 만들어낼 수 있는 로켓 말입니다."
 HND_nuclear: "전쟁의 미래"
 HND_nuclear_desc: "캘커타 정부의 가장 깊숙한 곳에 비밀 계획이 존재합니다. 캘커타 정부는 인류에게 알려진 가장 강력한 무기를 손에 넣으려 합니다. 이를 우리 손에 쥔다면, 어떤 승리도 가능할 것입니다."
 HND_central_command: "중앙사령부 수립"
 HND_central_command_desc: "내전에서 활동했던 많은 혁명 단체들로부터 나오는, 너무 많은 명령들이 쏟아져나오고 있습니다. 그들을 하나의 깃발 아래 하나로 모으고, 힘을 합쳐 앞으로 나아가야 합니다."
 HND_army_command: "새로운 바라트 육군"
 HND_army_command_desc: "우리의 육군은 가장 큰 전공을 거둘 수 있는 장군들을 임명하고, 전략과 전술을 개혁해야 합니다."
 HND_increase_training: "훈련소 설립"
 HND_increase_training_desc: "새로운 훈련소가 필요합니다. 우리는 많은 수의 군인들을 훈련시켜야 합니다. 그리고 만약 적들을 상대로 승리를 바란다면, 더 빨리 이뤄져야 합니다."
 HND_mobility: "기동 중점"
 HND_mobility_desc: "기병으로는 더 이상 부족합니다. 우리는 차량 운송에 집중하여, 우리 군의 기동성을 높여야 합니다."
 HND_modernize_army: "육군 현대화"
 HND_modernize_army_desc: "인도의 보병들은 수가 많은 데다가 충성스럽습니다. 하지만 그들의 장비는 오래되어 비효율적입니다. 우리는 이를 바로잡아야 합니다."
 HND_artillery_focus: "포병 현대화"
 HND_artillery_focus_desc: "코뮌의 포는 대부분 벨트크리크 중 사용된 것입니다. 적절한 지원을 제공해주지 않아 군인들이 죽기를 바라지 않는다면, 포병을 현대화해야 합니다."
 HND_armored_corps_1: "바라트 기갑부대"
 HND_armored_corps_1_desc: "우리 군에 장갑차를 제공한다면 적과 대치할 때 확실한 우위를 확보할 수 있을 것입니다."
 HND_armored_corps_2: "바라트 기갑부대 확충"
 HND_armored_corps_2_desc: "우리는 적들에 대해 경쟁력을 유지하기 위해 기갑부대를 계속해서 확충해야 합니다."
 HND_centralize_supply: "육군 보급 중앙집중화"
 HND_centralize_supply_desc: "육군에 보급을 제공하는 것은 여러 가지 산업에서 옵니다. 우리는 그 산업들을 결합하고 조직해야 합니다. 효율성을 극대화하고, 군대가 큰 이점을 얻을 수 있도록 말이죠."
 HND_adv_command_1: "지상 지배"
 HND_adv_command_1_desc: "우리의 주된 집중 대상은 육군입니다. 맞습니다. 이는 우리의 해군과 공군의 능력을 희생시키는 것일 수도 있지만, 코뮌은 진정한 힘이 어디에 있는지 인식하고 그 효과를 극대화해야 합니다."
 HND_air_command: "공군 사령부 수립"
 HND_air_command_desc: "코뮌이 벨트크리크 시절 미미하게나마 활용했던 공군력은 남아있지 않습니다. 처음부터 다시 건설되어야 하고, 이는 새로운 공군 사령부의 창설부터 시작됩니다."
 HND_air_training: "쿠타크 공군학교"
 HND_air_training_desc: "공군을 재건하기 위한 첫 번째 단계는, 미래의 공군 병사들을 훈련시킬 수 있는 공군학교의 창설입니다."

 HND_bomber_focus: "폭격기 중점"
 HND_bomber_focus_desc: "우리는 공중에서 적을 파괴하기 위해 폭격기를 건설하는데 집중해야 합니다!"
 HND_airborne: "붉은 사자 항공대 수립"
 HND_airborne_desc: "퇴역한 공군 제독은 낙하산 부대 창설을 제안했습니다. 비록 비용이 많이 드는 노력이겠지만, 적들을 기습하는 방법 중, 그들의 부대 뒤로 낙하하는 것보다 더 좋은 방법이 있을까요?"
 HND_CAS_focus: "근접지원항공기 중점"
 HND_CAS_focus_desc: "근접 항공 지원을 통해 우리는 무서운 정확도로 전투 중에 적 부대에 강력한 타격을 입힐 수 있어 전투에서 큰 우위를 점할 수 있습니다."
 HND_air_production: "공군 생산 확장"

 HND_navy_command: "해군 사령부 수립"
 HND_navy_command_desc: "내전 후에 우리 휘하에 남아 있던 배는 단 한 척도 없었고, 이로 인해 우리 해안은 적들의 공격을 받을 위험이 큽니다. 우리는 새로운 해군 사령부를 설립하고, 우리 자신을 바다로부터의 공격에 대해 보호하기 위해서 우리가 할 수 있는 모든 일을 해야 합니다."
 HND_calcutta_dockyard: "캘커타 조선소"
 HND_calcutta_dockyard_desc: "캘커타에 있는 조선 시설들은 아주 낡았습니다. 그것들은 바라트의 새로운 함대를 건설할 준비가 되어 있도록 확장되고 발전되어야 합니다."
 HND_submarine_focus: "잠수함 중점"
 HND_submarine_focus_desc: "잠수함은 적의 수송을 교란시키는 훌륭한 방법입니다. 우리는 가능한 한 잠수함을 많이 건조해야 합니다."

 HND_red_marines: "바라트 해병대 창설"
 HND_red_marines_desc: "정부 내 한 가지 제안은 적들의 해상 공격으로부터 자신을 방어하는 것이 아니라 적들의 해안을 공격할 수 있는 해병대를 건설하는데 집중하자고 합니다. 이는 흥미로운 생각이며, 만일 우리 함대가 지원할 가치가 있는 해병대라면, 분명 장점이 있을 것입니다."
 HND_protect_coasts: "코뮌의 해안 보호"
 HND_protect_coasts_desc: "우리는 중요한 항구를 방어하는데 집중하고 있고, 이를 위해 우리는 해안에 요새를 건설하여 해안의 공격으로부터 그것들을 보호할 수 있도록 해야 합니다."

 beng.1.a: "I must say, this is awfully exciting!"
 beng.2.t: "인도 국민회의 특별회담"
 beng.2.d: "Calcutta is steaming with excitement in the face of the [GetYear] Special Session of the Indian National Congress and the red flag flutters boldly from Writers' Building to the General Post Office. Inside the Calcutta High Court, the collected leadership of our republic's government has convened for the ensuing election of Lala Lajpat Rai's successor. It is expected that the appointment of a new head of state will mean a change within the nation's cabinet, prompting the various factions to vie for the most influence in all the various commissaries and committees that manage our country. Three wings have emerged within Congress: Bose's Maximists emulate Mosley's British Totalitarian Socialism and regard military force as a necessary revolutionary act for India's unification while Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi leads a pacifist, egalitarian and agrarian wing - striving for a negotiated end to the subcontinent's fragmentation. Standing between the two extremes is a coalition of trade unionists and ardent proponents of industrialism led by A. K. Fazlul Huq and his young protege, Jawaharlal Nehru. As the opening speeches begin to ring across the floor, the [GetYear] Special Session seems bound to change the path of free India in the next years."
 beng.2.a: "Internal fraction must be quelled!"
 beng.3.t: "보세가 지주주의를 비난하다"
 beng.3.d: "Although the greatest landowners and princes of Bengal and Orissa were deposed and their fiefs expropriated after the Calcutta government asserted itself in the years following 1926, the Bharatiya Commune never truly made the transformation into a socialist society. Lingering still in the villages and the smaller cities, the Zamindar system of the olden days continues to shape the days and lives of those who should have been lifted into prosperity by the glorious revolution almost a decade ago. Subhas Chandra Bose has taken the floor and delivered a crushing speech against this feudal instrument of oppression, demanding an immediate end to the privately owned great farms and mansions as well as their subjugation to complete state control. A sensitive issue, the debate on the rights of the remaining landlords has begun to spin out of control and a decision will have to be made."
 beng.3.a: "He is right, this feudal practice must be eradicated!"
 beng.3.b: "As per the moderates, let us only nationalise the grand estates."
 beng.3.c: "Heed the Mahatma and allow private property to exist."
 beng.4.t: "Jawaharlal Nehru Laments the State of Industry"
 beng.4.d: "At the end of the first week of the Special Session, young Jawaharlal Nehru has taken the floor, arguing for a further increase in our nation's industrial output and greater economic control by the state. Opposed to this stands the Gandhian wing of Congress, determined as they are that the heart and soul of Mother India is not her great cities, but rather the Harlequinesque patchwork of rural villages from Cape Comorin to the Mouth of the Indus. Accordingly, they believe the influx of state support should flow instead into the countryside, developing the rice paddies and benefiting the average Indian. The Maximists, on the other hand, find both Nehru's and Gandhi's proposals far too limited in their scope and hopelessly unambitious. Instead, Bose's supporters argue the state is more than capable of undertaking expansion in both sectors, requiring, of course, that the government absolutely control these endeavours."
 beng.4.a: "Industry and agriculture must both must be expanded, no matter the cost."
 beng.4.b: "네루가 옳다, 산업은 우선시되어야 한다."
 beng.4.c: "The soul of India is her villages - focus on agriculture!"
 beng.5.t: "The Mahatma Urges Unification"
 beng.5.d: "The Bharatiya Commune has been at peace with her neighbours since the civil war, but with changes in Burma, Lahore, and the gun-salute prince's federation unfolding at an unnerving pace, it is now obvious the special session will have to address the lingering question of unification. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, always a staunch opponent of violence, supports a negotiated end to the division of the subcontinent. Given how hard the revolutionaries had to fight during the last days of the Raj, this stance is rather controversial and both Huq and Bose find the notion all but treacherous. Nehru argues that the government should wage realpolitik and take opportunities as they come, while Bose has bombastically announced neither the Nizam nor the Dominion shall obtain any concession."
 beng.5.a: "Princes and lapdogs must be driven out at bayonet point!"
 beng.5.b: "Unification is paramount, the methods used are not!"
 beng.5.c: "Warfare is immoral, strive for a negotiated unification!"
 beng.6.t: "The Session Endorses Bose's Maximists"
 beng.6.d: "After much deliberation and exhausting debates, the Special Session of Congress has finally endorsed the platform proposed by Subhas Chandra Bose and his Maximists. The venerable war hero now ascends to absolute leadership within the Calcutta government, bringing with him a following of idealist and radicalised socialists. Gandhi is appalled at this blatant endorsement of violence and his left Calcutta for his ashram, giving Bose a benevolent audience for his acceptance speech. With the internal division now solved, our rivals around the continent will certainly have cause for worry!"
 beng.6.a: "Let the ruling classes tremble!"
 beng.7.t: "The Session Endorses Huq's Moderates"
 beng.7.d: "Sweeping into office, A. K. Fazlul Huq and young Nehru have soundly defeated all opposition to their pragmatic line of realpolitik. With Congress behind them, the new government will be able to enforce realistic, just and revolutionary policies throughout India. Already, news of the election has spread into the interior of our small republic, prompting spontaneous celebrations in its many villages. From now on, our goals and objectives are clear-cut! Total unification at any price!"
 beng.7.a: "Let the ruling classes tremble!"
 beng.8.t: "The Session Endorses the Mahatma's Agrarians"
 beng.8.d: "Prevailing against the extremist rantings of Bose and the dangerous warmongering of Fazlul Huq, the Great Soul, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, has finally established a solid majority government in Calcutta. Hoping that his quest for peace throughout India now will commence, Gandhi has seized control of all major offices within the cabinet. Hopefully, unification and swaraj will now arrive momentarily!"
 beng.8.a: "Together, in unity!"
 beng.9.t: "The Session Ends in a Stalemate!"
 beng.9.d: "Despite long debates and late scheming in the corridors of power, no absolute victor has emerged from the special session of the Indian National Congress. Greatly frustrating to the ageing Lala Lajpat Rai, who hoped to deliver the fate of Free India into secure hands, the venerable leader has completely resigned any influence in the bogged-down political metamorphosis. In his stead as mediators, both Bose and Gandhi frantically attempt to appeal to young Jawaharlal Nehru for support, at least creating some semblance of a coalition."
 beng.9.a: "Bose and Nehru agree on an electoral alliance!"
 beng.9.b: "The Mahatma sways young Nehru to his side!"
 beng.15.t: "The Question of India's Elites"
 beng.15.d: "As economic recovery continues in [Root.GetNameDef], one issue we are repeatedly encountering is that of the cultural elites that remain even after the changes to the social order following the civil war. They have neither the influence nor wealth they once did, but they are not without resources - and it is not uncommon for the 'lower classes' to give them deference even when the law is in their favour. These elites often ignore laws requiring them to work with those they see beneath them, and hold onto precious resources even when they are required to give them up. Gaining compliance will be tricky, considering many of our citizens take a blind eye to their transgressions."
 beng.15.a: "Force them to comply - by force if necessary!"
 beng.15.b: "Offer incentives to the elites to work with the new order."
 beng.15.c: "We need their resources - promote the willing to good positions."
 beng.16.t: "Resistance of the Elites Ended"
 beng.16.d.resistance: "Our programme to force the cultural elites to comply with national reforms has, after a great deal of resistance and many arrests, finally met with success."

 beng.16.d.promotion: "Our programme to cajole the cultural elites into supporting the national reforms has, after a great deal of time and at considerable cost, finally met with success."
 beng.16.a: "Now economic reforms can continue!"
 beng.17.t: "The Passing of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi"
 beng.17.d: "Perhaps the greatest soul to walk the Earth since Christ is no more. The Mahatma passed away quietly in his sleep at the venerable age of 80. He is succeeded as leader of the Agrarian Wing by the young scholar Nirmal Kumar Bose."
 beng.17.a: "편히 잠드소서."
 beng.18.t: "The Passing of Rabindranath Tagore"
 beng.18.d: "A staunch friend of Gandhi and quite possibly the greatest scholar-poet India has seen in hundreds of years passed away late last night surrounded by his grieving family. His place amongst the Agrarians has been taken by the eminent peasant leader Panjabrao Deshmukh."
 beng.18.a: "He is now where the mind has no fear."
 beng.19.t: "The Passing of Madame Cama"
 beng.19.d: "One of the most diligent early Indian revolutionaries, Bhikhaiji Rustom Cama passed away today whilst recuperating from fever. Having unfurled the first Indian national flag at the Stuttgart International Socialist Conference in 1907, Madame Cama enjoyed great prestige amongst both domestic as well as international revolutionaries."
 beng.19.a: "We shall march on! Until all of India is free!"
 beng.20.t: "Nationalising the Yenangyaung Oil Fields"
 beng.20.d: "The workers at the Yenangyaung Oil Fields were the primus motor of the recent Burmese revolution. Their strike against the capitalist system of robbery and oppression was what galvanised the latent dissatisfaction with the Konbaung dynasty into a full-scale uprising within both the military and the general populace. As the Burmese republic ascended to the Bharatiya Commune it now falls upon our government to determine how the means of production in Yenangyaung should be handled. The Anarcho-Syndicalist wing of the Indian National Congress argues that the local trade unions, being the true representatives of the local workers, ought to take full control of the oil fields. On the other hand, Bose's Maximists present a strong argument for complete state control and involvement in the day to day running of the plants. The government will have to make a clear decision to ensure the cooperation of our new Burmese comrades."
 beng.20.a: "Initiate a full national takeover of the Oil Fields!"
 beng.20.b: "Let the oil fields be run by the local trade unions."
 beng.20.c: "Maintain the status quo."
 beng.21.t: "Shripad Amrit Dange Reforms the Anushilan Samiti"
 beng.21.d: "At a local labour meeting in Calcutta close by Writer's Building, Shripad Amrit Dange and several prominent veteran revolutionaries such as Atulkrishna Ghosh and M.N. Roy have proclaimed their intention to organise a truly syndicalist and militant revolutionary organisation within the dominant INC. Seeing both the Maximist and Agrarian wings as compromised and Fazlul Huq's Moderates as corrupt, the group hopes to contest for commissary and delegate positions on the next round of elections to the government. Invoking the name old name 'Anushilan Samiti' (meaning 'Self-Culture Association') the group strongly advocates the use of force to overthrow the Hyderabad and Lahore governments as well as an economic system based on anarcho-syndicalist policies of cooperative farming and union-controlled industries."
 beng.21.a: "Let's hope he aims those bombs at the reactionaries!"
 beng.22.t: "파즈룰 후크에 대한 네루의 쿠데타"
 beng.22.d: "At a preliminary meeting of the Moderates, Jawaharlal Nehru has openly challenged A. K. Fazlul Huq for leadership. The split comes as no surprise to the political observers of Calcutta as Nehru has grown more and more disillusioned by the Tiger's singular preferable treatment of the Bengal. Hungry for the power needed to transform India along his own radicalised Fabian lines, Nehru launched a scathing attack on the elder Huq's political dealings with Nehru-loyalists Lal Bahadur Shastri and Gulzarilal Nanda immediately following up with their own denouncements of the old weary course. Visibly shaken by the coup and clearly lacking support from the majority of the grouping, Huq grudgingly abdicated leadership of the clique in favour of Nehru, who then proceeded to purge anyone not voting in his favour."
 beng.22.a: "Will this weaken or strengthen the Industrialists?"
 beng.23.t: "A Most Cordial Letter to Mr Mosley"
 beng.23.d: "In London, Oswald Mosley has, alongside a great number of revolutionary European dignitaries, proclaimed a new socialist doctrine uniting the most extreme and militant left-wing personalities of the continent behind the idea of Totalitarian Socialism. With its belief in an economy controlled by the state, the total involvement of the revolutionary vanguard in internal affairs and the importance of the state in preserving Socialism, Mosley's new theses have greatly impressed Subhas Chandra Bose, the great martial hero of the Indian Revolution. However, Bose's enthusiasm for this coordination of revolutionary ideology has greatly worried his opponents within the Calcutta Government. Nevertheless, Bose now sends his regards and support for this new doctrine to Comrade Mosley, stressing the need for cooperation between Calcutta and London in the proletarian struggle for the dissolution of the Capitalist system of murder and robbery."
 beng.23.a: "Maybe the Mahatma better watch out."
 beng.24.t: "Subhas Chandra Bose Sends his Regards"
 beng.24.d: "While the support of Mussolini and Valois cemented Mosley's new proletarian doctrine in Europe, news that the hero of the Indian Revolution, Subhas Chandra Bose, has endorsed the idea of Totalitarian Socialism, really strengthened Mosley's appeal within the British Union. Bose, who almost crushed the imperialists in 1926, is almost seen as an idolised figure of the revolution in the Far East and, as such, his opinion is highly regarded by many. Regardless, the notion of India and Britain, united as proletarian brothers instead of colonial master and slave has caught the people's fancy."
 beng.24.a: "India and Britain, revolutionary brothers!"
 beng.40.t: "앵글로-인도 무역협정"
 beng.40.d: "A most interesting proposal has just been wired to the officials at the Foreign Office by our consulate staff in Calcutta. Amid increasingly worrying developments in the other Indian successor states to the imperialist Raj, our good friends and proletarian brothers in [From.GetNameDef] are proposing a final economic deal to strengthen the backbone of their otherwise wobbly government with technical and industrial advisors from our British Union. In exchange, the workingman of Britain will receive a steady supply of bananas, tea and other exotic goods while his benevolent government gains access to vital resources such as rubber. R.H. Tawney, a seasoned politician with solid socialist credentials and good connections with Congress cadres in India from the early days of our Union, awaits the acceptance of London before boarding a ship to Calcutta to flesh out the deal."

 beng.40.b: "No way! International trade is the harbinger of capitalism!"
 beng.41.t: "[From.GetName]의 거부"
 beng.41.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government sends word declining the trade deal."
 beng.41.a: "No tea for the British, then!"
 beng.42.t: "Trading Tea for Arms"
 beng.42.d: "R.H. Tawney, the man who had ensured cordial relations between Calcutta and London in the chaotic days during the collapse of the British Empire, has arrived once more in India! He brings the greetings of our dear proletarian friends in [From.GetNameDef] and promises of a new and empowered industrial cooperation between the working people of our nations. Tawney himself oversaw the first nascent dispatch of British railway engineers and with his own roots firmly planted in the soil of India, he's determined to ensure that this new round of cooperation develops successfully. All that remains, is for our government to name its request in exchange for London's technical support."

The best place they can gather in any number is away from the cities, and a site in the mountains of Shimla has been selected.

 beng.59.d: "Even as [HND.GetAdjective] troops cross our border, we have reports that a socialist uprising has begun in the remote hills of Kolhapur - no doubt organised by [HND.GetNameDef] itself, right under our noses, to give us a second front to fight. We will need to move quickly."
 beng.59.a: "Damned socialist bastards!"
 beng.60.t: "Chaos in [PRF.GetNameDef]!"
 beng.60.d: "Osman Ali Khan's autocratic ambitions and hubris have finally driven the southern princes into open revolt! For the second time in a decade, the Hindu rulers of Mysore and Travancore waver in their oaths of loyalty towards their nominal overlord. Kannada and Malayalam troops already openly engage army units loyal to the Hyderabad government whilst the federal apparatus of state in the south has been thrown into absolute disarray. While it risks provoking the Nizam into war with us, and perhaps [RAJ.GetNameDef], this could be an opportune time to seize nearby Vizagapatnam which lies just across our border. Chances are good the Nizam is too busy to respond and will simply let it go."
 beng.60.a: "Send forces in to occupy Vizagapatnam"
 beng.60.b: "No, this is too risky a plan"
 beng.61.t: "Socialist Forces Move Into Vizagapatnam"
 beng.61.d: "No doubt taking advantage of our chaotic state, soldiers from [HND.GetNameDef] have begun streaming across the border into Vizagapatnam, fully intending to seize it and the entire state while we are busy with our civil war. If we attempt to stop them, it will mean open war with the east in addition to our current problems."
 beng.61.a: "We have no choice but to let them have it."
 beng.61.b: "We must fight for our territorial integrity!"
 beng.62.t: "Vizagapatnam Is Ours"
 beng.62.d: "As we suspected, the [PRF.GetAdjective] forces are too preoccupied to do much more than express outrage at our occupation of Vizagapatnam. By the time the war is done, the border will have been solidified."
 beng.62.a: "A fait accompli!"
 beng.70.t: "A Message of Peace"
 beng.70.d: "Our government has received a message today, sent through channels by [HND.GetNameDef] leadership. In it, the Mahatma requests a secret meeting between our nations - without our allies or others present, only true Indians - to discuss the possibility of a peaceful merger. One can only speculate what the Mahatma would ask, though most assume it would mean withdrawing from the Entente at the very least, and it's expected that such a plan would meet harsh resistance from the [HND.GetAdjective] Totalist faction. But... what if it's true? What if the Mahatma can indeed quell his extremists, and we can discuss a union without ever firing a shot? The reactionaries of [PRF.GetNameDef] would never go for such a deal, but should we?"
 beng.70.a: "We will attend the secret summit, if it's held."
 beng.70.b: "We must speak with our allies, first."
 beng.70.c: "No, even if this is serious, it will never work."
 beng.71.t: "[From.GetName]의 거부"
 beng.71.d: "While we had high hopes that the [RAJ.GetAdjective] would see reason and a benefit to peaceful talks, we've received quick word through channels that they will not attend any meeting to discuss reunion."
 beng.71.a: "Then our path is set, sadly."
 beng.72.t: "A Request from Lahore"
 beng.72.d: "Curious news from Lahore today - officials from [RAJ.GetNameDef] tell us that [HND.GetNameDef] has reached out to their government to begin talks about a peaceful reunion. It's unknown what the Mahatma would ask for, of if Lahhore would even agree, but most believe it would mean withdrawal from the Entente at the very least. It would, however, never happen without the [HND.GetAdjective] extremists first being quelled... so the result would be an India that is not our ally, but also not our enemy. If we were to refuse to give them permission, it's unknown how Lahore would react... or what we could even really do if they refused to comply."
 beng.72.a: "We give this meeting our blessing."
 beng.72.b: "No, they are too important to the Empire's interests."
 beng.73.t: "[From.GetName] Urges Caution"
 beng.73.d: "Our response from the [From.GetAdjective] government is caution: [Root.GetNameDef] is too vital to the Empire's interests to allow us to fall prey to what is surely a socialist scheme. A disappointing response, even if they might be correct. Even so, if we attended the meeting anyhow, what would they do about it? Go to war with us? There's no guarantee the meeting would even happen, or that we would agree to its results."
 beng.73.a: "We will attend the talks anyhow."
 beng.73.b: "So be it - give the Mahatma our regrets."
 beng.74.t: "[From.GetName] Gives its Blessing"
 beng.74.d: "The response from the [From.GetAdjective] government is cautious approval. If we can truly reunite with our fellow Indians, and in so doing eliminate the syndicalist threat to the sub-continent, then they would be willing to cut ties with the Dominion if that is what it takes. There is, after all, very little they could realistically do if we left, but they appreciate our consultation."
 beng.74.a: "Then tell the Mahatma we would be willing to attend."
 beng.74.b: "No, on second thought there's no use in risking this."
 beng.75.t: "The Dominion Agrees to the Summit"
 beng.75.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to the talks, though it's clear they are quite sceptical that we will propose something they can accept - or that we will not face serious opposition from extremists in our own camp. That last concern is true enough. Word of the summit will undoubtedly leak out before it happens, and we will have a reckoning with Subhas Chandra Bose and the Maximists, if not also others who support him."
 beng.75.a: "So be it!"
 beng.76.t: "The Lucknow Summit"
 beng.76.d: "Representatives from both [RAJ.GetNameDef] and [HND.GetNameDef] have gathered today in the city of Lucknow for a secret summit - one not attended by [RAJ.GetNameDef]'s allies, and mostly unknown to the peoples of either country. The Mahatma is personally in attendance and hopes to convince both sides of a plan of compromise that can allow them to come together, and most importantly, avoid a costly second civil war that would end innumerous lives. The reaction, should a plan of reunion emerge, will be difficult to anticipate."
 beng.76.a: "We shall see how this goes..."
 beng.77.t: "The Final Plan"
 beng.77.d: "After days of quiet deliberation, Gandhi and the attendees from [RAJ.GetNameDef] have reached an accord. It lays out various measures which would allow the collective industry to remain in the Bengal region, and for limits to be placed on princely power and affluence. It also means severing ties with the British Empire completely, and allowing the socialists to be permitted in future Indian elections - but not as syndicalists. Many Commune politicians and officers would be shut out of the system entirely, and there would be great adjustments to be made on both sides."
 beng.77.a: "Yes, we would agree to this - make the offer."
 beng.77.b: "No, this is too much - call off the summit now."
 beng.78.t: "The Final Plan"
 beng.78.d: "After days of quiet deliberation, Gandhi and the attendees from [RAJ.GetNameDef] have reached an accord. It lays out various measures which would allow the collective industry to remain in the Bengal region, and for limits to be placed on princely power and affluence. It also means severing ties with the British Empire completely, and allowing the socialists to be permitted in future Indian elections - though not as syndicalists. Gandhi would become the temporary head of state until elections are held to approve the plan, though by then the merger will be a fait accompli... if we agree to the plan."
 beng.78.a: "For good or ill, we agree to the Mahatma's proposal."
 beng.78.b: "No, this is too much - let's end this here."
 beng.79.t: "The Summit is Over"
 beng.79.d: "After days of quiet deliberation, it's become more and more clear that neither party will reach an agreement on reunification. The delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has elected to abandon the summit rather than continue talking, and so goes the last hope of peace on the sub-continent."
 beng.79.a: "So be it."
 beng.80.t: "Success at the Summit"
 beng.80.d: "The talks at the Lucknow Summit are over and a deal has been struck: the Commune will become part of the Dominion, with Gandhi assuming a role as head of state until elections are held in thirty days to approve the plan. Socialists will be permitted, but not syndicalists, and already many of our politicians and commanders are reacting with fury at being left out of the new government. What's done is done, however, and now will come a period of severe adjustment for both sides to come to terms with the new reality."
 beng.80.a: "Jai Hind!"
 beng.81.t: "The Bharatiya Exiles"
 beng.81.d: "Over the last days, streams of exiles from the former Dominion and the Commune have streamed into [Root.GetNameDef], seeking refuge and offering to fight for a true India - one represented not by traitors and socialists. We've ensured no syndicalist sympathisers number among their ranks, and there is also word that some of the north's princes do not take kindly to the Unionist Party's scheming and may attempt to break away and join our ranks. We shall see what [RAJ.GetNameDef]'s coming election brings."
 beng.81.a: "One way or another, a reckoning is coming."
 beng.82.t: "Maximists Threaten War"
 beng.82.d: "Word of the upcoming Lucknow Summit has spread, and Subhas Chandra Bose is up in arms over it. The leader of the Maximists has been spreading misinformation, suggesting that Totalist and syndicalist leaders would be imprisoned should the union occur, and now he's drummed up enough support to make an ultimatum to the Agrarians: call off the Lucknow Summit immediately and have the Mahatma step down, or they will remove the Agrarians by force."
 beng.82.a: "We cannot allow him to dictate the future of India."
 beng.82.b: "Very well, we will call off the talks."
 beng.83.t: "Maximists Seize Calcutta!"
 beng.83.d: "Maximist forces have stormed into the capital, seizing the Indian National Congress buildings and rounding up the leaders of the Agrarians. The Mahatma has been spirited off to an unknown prison and the Agrarians themselves have had their power severely curtailed - indeed, they may not even be able to participate in future Congress events. The civil war is now over."
 beng.83.a: "This will hurt."
 beng.84.t: "War with [HND.GetNameDef]"
 beng.84.d: "The preparations are over. The time has come for us to march against [HND.GetNameDef]!"
 beng.84.a: "Se be it!"
 beng.86.t: "The Maximists Are Defeated"
 beng.86.d: "Subhas Chandra Bose and his Maximists have been defeated, and already many of their leadership have been rounded up and imprisoned. The Maximists themselves will no longer be welcome at Congress, though the Agrarians are loath to actually outlaw them entirely or execute any of their members. Surely they would have done the same in reverse, had they the chance."
 beng.86.a: "But we're not them, are we?"
 beng.87.t: "We Are Victorious!"
 beng.87.d: "We have gained control over the entirety of the Bharatiya Commune - its future is now ours to dictate!"
 beng.87.a: "As it should be!"
 beng.88.t: "[From.GetName] In Chaos"
 beng.88.d: "While we avoided stepping into the conflict during its civil war, as both sides would quickly end their conflict the moment we crossed the border, the dust has settled in [From.GetNameDef] and it is now weak... perhaps weak enough to be easily defeated."
 beng.88.a: "They picked a poor time for a civil war."
 beng.89.t: "Agrarians Threaten War"
 beng.89.d.purge: "The purges to the Commune's army - more important, the efforts made by the Maximists to eliminate all officers loyal to the other factions - has stirred a great deal of anger within the Indian National Congress. The opposition has centred on the Mahatma himself, who has called on Bose to step down as chairman. While Gandhi has advocated peaceful resistance, there are elements within the Agrarians who are ready to lead a general uprising in his name - even if it means replacing him as party leader."
 beng.89.d.war: "The recent efforts of the Maximists to ready the people for war, and - perhaps more importantly - the efforts to ensure their loyalty is solely to the Totalist portion of the Indian National Congress has elicited a great deal of alarm from the other parties. The opposition has centred on the Mahatma himself, who has called on Bose to step down as chairman. While Gandhi has advocated peaceful resistance, there are elements within the Agrarians who are ready to lead a general uprising in his name - even if it means replacing him as party leader."
 beng.89.a: "The time has come to eliminate the Agrarians altogether."
 beng.89.b: "Quietly eliminate Gandhi and the unrest will ease."
 beng.90.t: "Agrarians Seize Calcutta!"
 beng.90.d: "Agrarian forces have stormed into the capital, seizing the Indian National Congress buildings and rounding up the leaders of the Maximists. Subhas Chandra Bose has been arrested, and the Maximists themselves have had their power severely curtailed - indeed, they may not even be able to participate in future Congress events. The civil war is now over."
 beng.90.a: "This will hurt."
 beng.92.t: "Agrarians Seize Calcutta"
 beng.93.t: "The Agrarians Are Defeated"
 beng.93.d: "Nirmal Kumar Bose and his Agrarians have been defeated, and already many of their leadership have been rounded up and imprisoned. The Agrarians as a whole will no longer be welcome at Congress, their faction having been outlawed, and many of their most important members will be summarily executed after a speedy trial. Surely they would have done the same in reverse, had they the chance."
 beng.93.a: "They will never get that chance again."
 beng.100.t: "The State-Reorganisation Act"
 beng.100.d: "The provinces of the vanquished reactionary states were organised in a predictably feudal manner. Princes administered some, while others fell under bourgeois control. Before venturing into debating what concrete political changes should be made to the societal structure of our new domains, Congress must first decide how to administer the new districts. Bose's Maximists argue for large blocs of coherent ethnolinguistic provinces together forming the backbone of the centralised state, whilst the Agrarians take the opposite stance and recommend smaller sub-state entities controlled by local village communes. Nehru's industrialists favour middle-sized linguistic states modelled on traditional provincial divisions, while Dange's Young India suggest a union of council-driven provinces created by popular referendums. As the delegates take the floor, the first debate on the future of India is about to unfold!"

 beng.101.t: "The Issue of Landlordism"
 beng.101.d: "Prevalent throughout non-Socialist India, but especially in the Princely Federation, the zamindari system was a feudal institution of exploitation where landlords held economic and social power over the workers and farmers working on their factories and estates. With our liberation of the suffering proletariat, Congress now has to decide what to do with the means of production. The Maximists argue for swift centralisation, the Agrarians, as always, favour local village authority, the Moderates demand a balance of central and local ownership, while Dange's wing suggests orthodox Syndicalist theories of trade-union control as the solution to the administration of the liberated economic institutions."

 beng.101.c: "Let the provinces organise collectivisation individually."
 beng.101.e: "Organise trade unions to run the collectivised farms."
 beng.102.t: "Enforcing Economic Coherence"
 beng.102.d: "The Indian sub-continent is as diverse economically as it is ethnically and religiously. The merchants in Bombay and Karachi thrive on foreign trade through the Strait of Hormuz and the Suez, while the peasants of the Gangetic Plain toil mainly for themselves and their local communities. It is thus extremely complex to tailor an economic policy able to cover all the various business and enterprise strata. However, that is just what Subhas Chandra Bose is proposing. Envisaging a total state involvement in all layers of business, the Maximists claim that only such drastic measures can ensure the total eradication of the capitalist society and the substantiation of a truly egalitarian and socialist India. Naturally, the other wings of Congress beg to differ..."

 beng.102.e: "Orthodox Syndicalism shall unite all Indians economically."
 beng.103.t: "Maintaining Order in the New Provinces"
 beng.103.d: "As the army finished off its last opponents, the military consequently took on the role as a force of occupation. This is in some cases discouraging for our newly liberated brothers, as the presence of army patrols make us look not as liberators of the proletariat, but rather as foreign invaders. Some voices in Congress call for a more lenient strategy towards the new provinces, while others argue that a reduction of army units will inevitably pave the way for reactionary terrorists and guerrillas."
 beng.103.a: "Martial law must be strictly enforced!"
 beng.103.b: "The People's Police shall oversee the integration."
 beng.103.c: "Withdraw the army, but maintain garrisons in key cities."
 beng.103.e: "Raise local workers' militias to enforce order."
 beng.104.t: "Status of Minority, Religious, and Caste Rights"
 beng.104.d: "A veritable mass of patterns of different ethnicities, religions, and caste sub-groupings, Indian politics have always swayed between the extremes of cultural accommodation and subjection. The Calcutta government has employed a wide variety of policies within our own territories to maintain the rights of the so-called untouchables, people ostracised from society on religious grounds found in mainstream Hinduism. All parties agree that minority rights are essential, however, the means of enforcing these in the far more traditional and conservative provinces recently liberated from reactionary rule seem to be far more difficult to agree upon. As the Congress draws to a close, it is evident that this last issue will be invaluable for any of the fractions who wish to secure a majority."
 beng.104.a: "The army shall guard the rights of all the peoples of India!"
 beng.104.b: "Untouchability is a sin. Let the people know it!"
 beng.104.c: "A slow implementation of equal rights will secure stability."
 beng.104.e: "Create workers' committees to ensure equality."
 beng.105.t: "Bose's Maximists Control Congress"
 beng.105.d: "As the special session of the INC concludes, a clear majority has gathered around the arguments of the martial giant Subhas Chandra Bose and his Maximists. With a clear mandate, it now falls on Bose to implement a new order on the Indian subcontinent and facilitate the birth of a Totalist Raj."

 beng.107.t: "The Agrarians Control Congress"

 beng.108.t: "Dange's Syndicalists Control Congress"
 beng.108.d: "With his solid base of support in the Indian trade unions and a clever political alliance with the old revolutionary guard, Shripad Amrit Dange has managed to rally congress behind his anarcho-syndicalist platform. Now it is time to restore Mother India to her rightful place of glory by the means of true socialist liberation!"
 beng.108.a: "Now we're truly an anarcho-syndicalist commune!"
 beng.109.t: "The Congress Ends in a Stalemate"
 beng.109.d: "Despite the debates going into the early hours, Congress has not yet found a single majority. It would appear that only some sort of coalition between the various fractions can lead to a working government. In this regard, Nehru might be the king-maker - as he stands comfortably between the extremes of the INC."

 beng.109.c: "Nehru utilises Dange's union support to take the presidency!"
 beng.110.t: "The Place of the Red Raj in the World"
 beng.110.d: "With India united behind the Calcutta government and the provinces of the pretender governments brought under Socialist administration, the cabinet has begun to debate what course we should take internationally. A logical decision would be to seek an alignment with the Internationale and thus formally take our rightful place among the great Syndicalist nations of the world. Others, however, argue that we ought to make our own bloc of alliances - a force of Socialism with an oriental face. Such a course would definitely allow us greater freedom when it comes to spreading the revolution, but might cost us the technological benefit of associating with the great armies of the Internationale."
 beng.110.a: "We shall be the Internationale's Sword in Asia!"

 beng.111.b: "We have no use for Bolsheviks in turbans..."

 beng.112.a: "Is that so?"
 beng.113.t: "The Case of the Dominion Government's Officer Corps"
 beng.113.d: "The National Government has finally dislodged the last vestiges of British influence on the Indian sub-continent and enforced a truly native system of governance on the troublesome north-western provinces. Some of the officers who once swore loyalty to the Dominion Government have expressed wishes to continue to serve Mother India, placing the nation above political alignment. However, if we enrol these men we might face trouble from our own officers who resent serving alongside former enemies."
 beng.113.a: "The Nation needs every single man!"
 beng.113.b: "We have no need for British lapdogs!"
 beng.114.t: "Integration in the Gangetic Plain"
 beng.114.d: "The Gangetic plain is the main economic artery for Indian commerce and industry. The sooner the better these people come under the complete control of Calcutta, the better."

 beng.114.b: "Take a moderate approach to integration."
 beng.114.c: "We must be forceful in establishing socialist control!"
 beng.115.t: "Integration in the North-West"
 beng.115.d: "The North-western provinces of India have been a stronghold of petty bourgeois interests mixed with several reactionary princely states. The traders and industrialists of Karachi and the Punjab particularly seem to oppose any radical change to the economic and societal changes we propose. We must tread carefully in order to secure their loyalty... or be forceful."
 beng.115.a: "Take a moderate approach to integration."

 beng.117.t: "Resistance in [damage_state.GetName]!"
 beng.117.d: "Protests in the formerly British-puppet state of [damage_state.GetName] have grown increasingly violent as of late, spurred on by what we believe to be a democratic resistance group operating out of remote regions in the territory. Multiple terrorist bombings have accompanied the protests, and will likely continue until we fully assert control over [damage_state.GetName]'s people."
 beng.117.a: "This is what they call 'freedom'?!"
 beng.118.t: "What to do with the Reactionary Officers"
 beng.118.d: "We have through the force of arms and diplomacy eradicated the two reactionary pretender governments and proclaimed a new progressive Raj of socialist equality. Some of the non-royal commissioned officers of our defeated enemies have expressed a desire to serve in our armed forces, putting the nation above political concern. Tempting it is, including former enemies in the Red Army could be a dangerous thing..."
 beng.118.a: "We will employ all who will fight for the revolution!"
 beng.118.b: "We cannot trust these reactionary maggots!"
 beng.119.t: "Integration in the Former Bombay Presidency"
 beng.119.d: "In the former Bombay Presidency there's a strong labour movement in Bombay city itself. This will be valuable when commencing our process of integration, although the interior villages and cities have a more conservative streak. Nevertheless, we must decide upon a course of action when it comes to the process of integration."
 beng.119.a: "Take a moderate approach to integration."
 beng.119.b: "We must be forceful in establishing socialist control!"
 beng.120.t: "Integration in the Dravidian Princely States"
 beng.120.d: "The southern princely states were always somewhat politically detached from the federal government in Hyderabad. This makes it harder for us to establish an efficient central administration. Nevertheless, that is what we will have to achieve."
 beng.120.a: "Take a moderate approach to integration."
 beng.120.b: "We must be forceful in establishing socialist control!"

 beng.122.a: "No doubt funded with princely wealth..."
 beng.125.t: "A Special Session of the INC"
 beng.125.d: "The constitutionally mandated 5-year term of the incumbent executive committee has come to an end, marking the beginning of a new round of political skulduggery and backstabbing as the various factions vie for control over congress. Calcutta is draped in the red flag of Free India and the streets are alive with the sounds of excitement."
 beng.125.a: "Let's get to work, comrades!"
 beng.126.t: "The Judicial Reform Act"
 beng.126.d: "In the wake of Indian reunification under the aegis of the Calcutta government, a major source of discontent across the subcontinent has proven to be the lack of central direction of the judicial system. With some provinces and districts being in the hands of local worker's and peasant's committees and others still ruling based on the old colonial codes, the Congress is in agreement that a more effective and streamlined legal apparatus is sorely needed. However, how such a system precisely should function - and who should control it - is hotly debated by all."
 beng.126.a: "All within the state, nothing against the state."
 beng.126.b: "A decentralised three-tier system for each province."
 beng.126.c: "A strong supreme court is needed to secure our liberty."
 beng.126.e: "A league of union tribunals should do the trick."
 beng.127.t: "The States and the Central Government"
 beng.127.d: "Five years have passed since the States Reorganisation Act was adopted by Congress, yet friction still exists between the provinces and the central government as to who should wield the most influence in the villages and cities of India. The Maximists wish the states to be completely subjugated to the rulings of the executive, only retaining insignificant administrative power. The Agrarian Wing, on the contrary, argues the complex nature of the Indian nation calls for a loose confederation of states with the executive only permitted supreme control of defence matters and All-Indian industries. Dange's Young India share the mistrust of a strong central government, but suggest creating a coordinating States Committee elected by local trade unions to ensure some coherence amongst India's provinces. Nehru proposes a quasi-federal structure with each province retaining a token legislative as well as chief ministers and governors, who in turn answer to the central government."

 beng.128.t: "The Industrial Policy Resolution Act"
 beng.128.d: "Industrial development has been a major focus for most of the congress factions (as even the Agrarians recognise the need for some heavy industry), but the question of which course is the right for our nation's industrial sector is as hotly contested as ever."
 beng.128.a: "All layers of the economy must be centrally administered."

 beng.128.c: "Central planning and nationalisation of vital industries."
 beng.128.e: "Orthodox Syndicalism shall unite all Indians economically."
 beng.129.t: "The Case of Our Foreign Obligations"
 beng.129.d: "The Revolution might have triumphed in India and heralded in a new era of Socialist brotherhood under the aegis of the Red Raj, but the world is still plagued by the twin evils of the possessing classes - feudalism and capitalism. Although we already have a significant diplomatic presence abroad, the issue of our commitment to the international welfare of the Syndicalist system has come up as an important point in today's debates. As usual, the most glaring difference is between the Agrarians and the Maximists, with the former advocating a peaceful promotion of Socialism within India, while the latter argue bellicosely for the revolution to be promoted abroad at bayonet point. Dange and Nehru occupy a middle position."

 beng.130.t: "The Case of Military Restructuring"
 beng.130.d: "Although the Indian Red Army was successful in its charge to secure the reunification of the subcontinent under the control of the Calcutta Government, it has become a too-rigid organisation with conflicting loyalties. Always distrusting of too-centrally controlled authority, both Dange's Syndicalists and the Agrarians argue for a gradual demobilisation and thorough democratisation of the armed forces, Dange even going so far as to call for democratically-elected officers chosen by the serviceman's trade unions. Both Nehru and the Totalists believe in a strong army, but the former places far more emphasis on reforming and upgrading the existing equipment, while the Totalists wish to expand all three service branches while also enforcing a strict hierarchical command structure with full military discipline."

 beng.131.t: "Maximists Control Congress"
 beng.131.d: "As the special session of the INC concludes, a clear majority has gathered around the arguments of the Maximists. With support affirmed from Congress, the Maximists now stand ready to defend the republic against all foes!"
 beng.131.a: "The State shall persevere and flourish!"
 beng.132.t: "Jawaharlal Nehru Seizes Congress"
 beng.132.d: "Finally in control of the Moderates faction, Nehru has crowned his political success with having his party line endorsed by a majority of congress."
 beng.132.a: "This is our Tryst With Destiny!"
 beng.133.t: "The Agrarians Control Congress"
 beng.133.d: "To the roaring applause of the Congress, the wing supporting the ideals of the Mahatma has managed to secure support for its line by the party. Throughout rural India, the hope is that the new cabinet will secure peace and prosperity from Karachi to Calcutta."
 beng.133.a: "Our great nation shall be healed by the mercy of the victors."
 beng.134.d: "Dange's Syndicalists Control Congress"
 beng.134.t: "With his solid base of support in the Indian trade unions and a clever political alliance with the old revolutionary guard, Shripad Amrit Dange has managed to rally congress behind his anarcho-syndicalist platform. Now it is time to restore Mother India to her rightful place of glory by the means of true socialist liberation!"
 beng.134.a: "Now we're truly an anarcho-syndicalist commune!"
 beng.135.t: "The Congress Ends in a Stalemate"
 beng.135.d: "Despite the debates going into the early hours, Congress has not yet found a single majority. It would appear that only some sort of coalition between the various fractions can lead to a working government. In this regard, Nehru might be the king-maker - as he stands comfortably between the extremes of the INC."
 beng.135.a: "Nehru forms a coalition with the Maximists!"
 beng.135.b: "Nehru convinces the Agrarians to support his platform!"

 HND_lala_lajpat_rai_leader_desc: "Lala Lajpat Rai, Punjabi Hindu philanthropist, returned from championing Indian independence in the United States to formulate the creation of a new socialist state in India. With the collapse of British rule in late 1925, Rai, along with other Indian socialist figureheads, proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of Bengal. While the People's Republic initially failed to unite India through force, it managed to consolidate its rule over the northeastern third of the sub-continent. Rai, once relatively secure in his leadership of the People's Republic, renamed the Bharatiya Commune to indicate its ambition of unification, now faces spirited opposition from competing socialist factions. With his advanced age and waning influence, Rai has announced his intent to resign from his post. His successor may well determine the future of the Commune itself."
 HND_mohandas_karamchand_gandhi_leader_desc: "A former lawyer, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi valued highly the gradual, peaceful, and lawful independence of India from British rule. With the collapse of the Raj, however, he and his many followers were forced to reassess their position. Though still a proponent of pacifism, Gandhi has become increasingly influenced by the ideas of his colleagues in the now radicalised Indian National Congress. Gandhi's victory in the Indian National Congress's special session has awoken renewed hope for the peaceful reunification of the Indian sub-continent and the reconciliation of its divided factions."
 HND_nirmal_kumar_bose_leader_desc: "Nirmal Kumar Bose, protégé of the famous Mohandas Gandhi, has assumed leadership of the Bharatiya Commune. He is likely to continue the agrarian reforms of Gandhi, and encourage the non-violent reunification of India. Many dissidents within the Bharatiya Commune, however, are displeased with Bose's rise to power, believing, despite official explanations to the contrary, that Bose masterminded Gandhi's demise."
 HND_abul_kasem_fazlul_huq_leader_desc: "Fazlul Huq, former secretary of the Bengali Muslim League, and now an avowed Syndicalist, has led his 'Moderate' faction to victory in the Indian National Congress's special session. He campaigned on a platform of trade-union centric industrialisation and the gradual implementation of socialist reform. Despite his electoral success, however, Fuq still faces staunch opposition from opposing factions of the Indian National Congress. Regardless, Fuq's vision of prosperity in the historically impoverished eastern India, and perhaps one day the entire sub-continent, appears, at least to his supporters, to be increasingly achievable."
 HND_shripad_amrit_dange_leader_desc: "Shripad Amrit Dange is perhaps the most radical syndicalist within the Indian National Congress. Much like Nestor Makhno of the French Anarchistes, he advocates the eventual disestablishment of the very state itself. Unlike the Anarchistes however, rather than promoting rural collectivisation, Dange advocates industrialisation and the assumption by trade unions of the entire economic apparatus."
 HND_jawaharlal_nehru_leader_desc: "Jawaharlal Nehru is almost certainly the most tactful of the Bharatiya Commune's prominent political leaders. With the collapse of the British Raj, Nehru, while a staunch advocate for immediate independence from the weakened Empire, worked tirelessly to mediate all manner of disputes among Indian leaders across the political spectrum. While his detractors would slander Nehru as indecisive and cowardly, Nehru's subtle political manoeuvring was essential for his ascension to the highest levels of the Indian National Congress, and now the Bharatiya Commune itself. Under Nehru's leadership, perhaps the factionalism which has plagued the Congress for decades may finally be assuaged."
 HND_subhas_chandra_bose_leader_desc: "As a boy, Subhas Chandra Bose once assaulted a British schoolmaster for defaming his beloved India; his expulsion thereafter left Bose with an almost rabid desire for vengeance. Shortly before the collapse of the British Raj, Bose attracted large swaths of the Indian population to the socialist cause with incendiary speeches against all who would deny India's people sole dominion over the sub-continent. With the success of Bose's Maximists within the Indian National Congress, the Bharatiya Commune as a whole has begun to assume a similarly militaristic outlook; it now looks to strike a decisive blow to the hearts of the Dominionists and Princely Federation alike."

 beng.200.d.RAJ: "With India finally unified, it is time to rebuild and decide on where we want the capital of the country to be. While Lahore has served us well, it may be wise to return to Delhi where the infrastructure and opportunities to turn it into an economic centre had started to be established since 1911. Alternatively, we can go back to Calcutta, the old capital of British India, where the period of industrial growth under the Bharatiya Commune and its proximity to the coast could be a useful asset to India’s trade with the rest of the world. Hyderabad, meanwhile, at the heart of southern India, founded in 1591, has become a cultural centre in the last couple decades. Or we can choose to stay in Lahore, that has stayed our provisional capital, while we slowly integrate the rest of the country and rid it of reactionary and radical elements."

Hyderabad, meanwhile, at the heart of southern India, founded in 1591, has become a cultural centre in the last couple decades. While moving to one of these locations could help raise support from the people, they still have yet to understand the benefits of socialism under our leader, [ROOT.GetLeader]. Staying in Calcutta, the home of the revolution, would also be symbolic for generations to come. The Eastern Front of the Third Internationale will start here!"

With the British lapdogs in Lahore re-emerging as a serious contender to the mantle of the Raj's legal successor and the Burmese monarchy rattled by student protests and strikes, Rai has concluded that the government of free India will have to be refitted and reorganised if we are to keep up with the development of our neighbouring rivals - and as such he has decided to step down from his position within the year. Rai's resignation marks a potential end to the compromise government that emerged after the Indian Civil War, with both Gandhi's Agrarians and Subhas Chandra Bose's Maximists longing for definitive influence within Congress and the Calcutta government as a whole."
