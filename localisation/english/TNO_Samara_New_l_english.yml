 SAM_Smuta_Bunyachenko: "동란시대 - 부냐첸코"
 SAM_the_face_of_a_slave_a_prisoner: "노예이자 죄인의 얼굴"
 SAM_the_face_of_a_slave_a_prisoner_desc: "독일인에게 포로로 잡혔을 때, 나 세르게이 부냐첸코는 그때를 절대 잊지 않겠다고 다짐했다. 그들은 내 영혼 깊숙한 곳에 그들의 낙인을 찍었다. 수용소에서 나는 개만도 못한 존재였으며 영원히 내 존재를 속박당하며 다른 모든 러시아인의 더 나은 미래를 만들어야 했다. 그들이 나를 증오하더라도, 그들이 나를 미워하더라도 이 천한 노예인 나는 나의 개인적인 지옥을 다른 사람과 공유하지 않을 것이다.\n\n이를 위해서라면, 나는 내가 해야 할 일을 할 것이다."
 SAM_thank_you_but_i_didnt_want_this: "고맙네만, 이것을 원하지는 않았네."
 SAM_thank_you_but_i_didnt_want_this_desc: "러시아 해방군의 지도자가 된다는 것은 대단한 명예이지만, 부냐첸코는 그런 명예가 그에게 돌아갈 것이라고는 기대하지 않았다. 그는 반역의 악취로 오염된 그런 높은 자리를 얻기 위해서 그리 많은 것을 하지 않았기 때문이다. 그럼에도 불구하고 그는 다른 누구도 그 자리에 따르는 책임을 지지 못할 것으로 생각했기 때문에 그 자리를 받아들여야만 했다. 이번에 그는 러시아를 위해 옳은 일을 할 것이다. 이번에야말로 그는 해야만 한다."
 SAM_celebrations_all_for_legitimacy: "기념행사, 정통성을 위한 모든 것"
 SAM_celebrations_all_for_legitimacy_desc: "여기서 집회, 그 뒤 만찬, 저기서 분열 행진. 사람들은 우리의 통치에 대해 별다른 지지를 보내지 않고 있고, 우리는 이 분위기를 바꿔야 합니다. 부냐첸코가 집권한 뒤 정권의 정통성과 사람들의 지지를 얻기 위해서 우리는 사람들이 일상생활의 어려움에서 눈을 돌리고 그들의 기분을 고양하는 데 필요한 기념행사를 개최할 것입니다."
 SAM_too_much_sloth_weakens_an_army: "나태는 군대를 약하게 만든다"
 SAM_too_much_sloth_weakens_an_army_desc: "부냐첸코의 집권을 축하하며 낭비할 시간은 없습니다. 우리에게는 처리해야 할 일이 많기에 우리가 가진 자원을 보존해야 합니다. 우리는 기분전환을 위한 무의미한 축제를 열어 국민들이 나태해지도록 만들 수 없습니다. 지금은 힘든 나날이고, 잠시 뒤에는 더욱 힘들어질 예정이기에 우리는 국민들이 만일의 사태에 대비할 수 있게 해야 합니다."
 SAM_too_much_sloth_weakens_an_army_tt: "§FThe cost to complete §W$RUS_Decision_Smuta_Chaos_Decrease_CP$§! will §Tbe halved§!.§!\n"
 SAM_not_a_hero_but_a_leader: "영웅이 아닌, 지도자"
 SAM_not_a_hero_but_a_leader_desc: "세르게이 부냐첸코는 영웅이 아니다. 그렇지만 그는 다른 사람이 따를만한 남자라는 사실을 증명해 내었다. 그도 독일 수용소에서 시간을 보냈다. 그도 군인의 어려움을 알고 있다. 부냐첸코는 영웅은 아니지만, 그것이 군인들이 그의 명령을 따르는 데 문제가 되지 않는다. 군인들은 그가 필요하다면 기꺼이 총을 들고 그들 옆에서 같이 싸울 것임을 알기에 그를 존경한다."
 SAM_scores_to_settle_all_too_many: "너무나도 많은, 해결해야할 원한"
 SAM_scores_to_settle_all_too_many_desc: "모든 러시아인을 단결시킬 수 있는 주제는, 특히 그들을 보호하기 위해 복무하는 우리 군대에는 더욱, 바로 독일에 대한 원한과 우리 것을 되찾고자 하는 열망입니다. 우리 군대에 독일군에게 포로로 잡혔던 사람들이 많기 때문에 개인적인 측면에서나, 이념적인 측면에서나 우리는 청산해야 할 원한들이 너무나도 많습니다. 우리는 내분과 반란을 막기 위해 독일에 대한 증오와 복수에 초점을 맞추어 선전할 것입니다."
 SAM_a_strong_russia_a_comfortable_life: "강한 러시아와 편안한 삶"
 SAM_a_strong_russia_a_comfortable_life_desc: "다른 무엇보다도 우리 장병들이 원하는 것은 그들과 그들 가족을 위한 더 나은 삶입니다. 우리가 그들을 단결시키고 우리의 깃발 아래 불러 모으기 위해서는 오랫동안 궁핍한 생활을 해온 장병들에게 그들이 필요하고, 당연히 받아야 할 미래를 약속해야 합니다. 자유, 편안한 삶, 그리고 안전을."
 SAM_talk_to_me_directly: "나에게 직접 말하라"
 SAM_talk_to_me_directly_desc: "더 이상 우리 군 내에서 하급 장교의 불복종과 도전은 그냥 넘어가지 않을 것이다. 우리의 무장 투쟁 중에 그들은 허황된 영광을 얻기 위해 허가 받지 않고 어리석은 작전을 수행해 왔고 때로는 상급 제대의 군사 전략을 위태롭게 했다. 지금부터는 독단적으로 이런 무책임한 행동을 지시하는 장교는 강하게 처벌할 것이다."
 SAM_but_i_will_do_whats_necessary: "...그러나 나는 필요한 일은 할 것이다"
 SAM_but_i_will_do_whats_necessary_desc: "지금 일을 바로잡기 위한 기회가 나타난 만큼, 부냐첸코는 기회를 낭비하지 않을 것입니다. 옥탄이나 지코프같은 자들이 러시아를 위해 최선의 일을 할 것이라고 믿을 수 없으며, 다른 선택의 여지가 없는 부냐첸코는 기꺼이 그의 비전을 현실로 만들 것입니다. 러시아의 위대한 미래는 그의 앞에 펼쳐져 있습니다. 남은 일은 단지 손을 뻗어 기회를 잡는 것뿐입니다."
 SAM_food_shelter_protection: "식량, 주거지, 보호"
 SAM_food_shelter_protection_desc: "우리는 정부의 통치에 반감을 보이는 자들을 단순히 다 죽여버릴 수 없습니다. 그들은 너무나도 많고, 우리는 너무나도 적습니다. 따라서 대중을 채찍으로만 다스리는 것은 현명하지 못한 행동입니다. 가혹한 채찍 대신에 우리는 그들에게 당근을 줄 수 있다고 약속해야 합니다. 그들이 우리를 끌어내리려고 시도하는 것보다 우리가 약속한 당근을 받는 것이 구원받을 수 있는 더 쉬운 선택지라고 생각하게 만들어야 한다. 굶주렸거나, 집이 없거나, 안전하지 않거나 상관없이 우리는 그들의 필요를 충족시키기 위해 사용할 수 있는 자원들로 우리가 할 수 있는 일을 할 것이다. 우리가 제공한 것들이 항상, 특히 지금 당장에는 더욱, 충분하지 않을지라도 그들이 불만을 내지 않도록 주저하게 만들기에는 충분할 것입니다."
 SAM_punishment_exile_death: "처벌, 추방, 사망"
 SAM_punishment_exile_death_desc: "옥탄의 깡패무리와 지코프의 영리한 선전가는 러시아를 위한 계획의 가장 큰 내부 위협이 되는 사람들이다. 우리는 필요한 것이라면 어떤 수단을 써서라도 그들의 남아있는 권력을 제거할 것이다. 처벌로 납득할 수 있는 사람들은 필요한 만큼 충분히 오랫동안 투옥될 것이다. 처벌로 끝낼 수는 없지만 용서받을 수 있는 사람들은 영구 추방당할 것이다. 우리가 도저히 위험을 감수할 수 없다고 판단된 자들은 처형당할 것이다. 이 모든 것은 국가의 이름으로 벌어질 것이다. 우리가 용서받으려면 이런 종류의 위협은 그 존재 자체가 용납될 수 없다."
 SAM_not_a_dictator_but_a_saviour: "독재자가 아닌, 구원자"
 SAM_not_a_dictator_but_a_saviour_desc: "현재 우리가 상황에 대한 진실을 바꿀 수 없고 바꿔서도 안 되지만, 적어도 보이는 모습만큼은 바꿔야 한다. 우리는 군대가 통치하는 국가에서 외형만큼은 민간 주도로 보이는 국가로 바꾸기 시작해야 한다. 왜냐하면 우리가 민간정부라고 최소한의 가장도 하지 않는다면, 군 복무에 부적합한 많은 사람이 정부에 참여하지 않으려 할 것이고, 우리는 많은 전문 지식과 기술력을 놓칠 것이기 때문이다."
 SAM_tall_smokestacks_everywhere: "높은 굴뚝, 어디에나 있는"
 SAM_tall_smokestacks_everywhere_desc: "러시아 경제를 활성화하기 위해서는 산업계 지도자와의 협력은 중요하다. 그들의 도움 없이는 러시아의 경제를 발전시키는 것은 고사하고 방향을 개선하기조차 어려울 것이다. 우리는 그들과 만나 우리의 입장을 이해하도록 만들고, 우리의 공업 생산량과 경제력을 크게 높아지도록 협력할 것이다."
 SAM_much_energy_to_be_used: "많이 사용되는 에너지"
 SAM_much_energy_to_be_used_desc: "복무를 하지 못하는 자들은 일할 것입니다. 이 규칙은 가혹하지만, 현재 우리는 절박한 상황에 놓여있으며, 그에 맞는 대책이 필요합니다. 우리는 노동력 동원을 늘릴 것이며 완전고용을 달성하고자 할 것입니다. 일할 수 있는 모든 사람은 개인이 그 일을 좋아하는지 상관없이 일할 것입니다. 다른 어떤 것도 할 수 없는 사람들은 우리가 통제하고 있는 영토 전역에서 필요하지만, 비천한 일을 하게 될 것입니다."
 SAM_much_skills_to_be_employed: "고용되기 충분한 기술"
 SAM_much_skills_to_be_employed_desc: "우리 군대에는 훌륭한 행정적 재능을 가진 많은 사람이 있지만, 그들이 자원하지도 않았고 진급 가능성도 없는 군대에서 시들어 가고 있다는 사실에 우리는 주목했습니다. 이 사람들은 다른 곳에서 쓰일 것입니다. 이미 충분한 관료제가 적용된 군대의 기능을 지원하는 대신, 그들은 우리 영토 내에서 충원이 절실히 필요한 직책을 받을 것입니다. 이제 그들은 관료가 되어 필수품과 복잡한 문제를 조절하면서 군인 대신 민간인을 다스릴 것입니다."
 SAM_you_cant_scare_me_now: "이제 나는 너희들이 두렵지 않다"
 SAM_you_cant_scare_me_now_desc: "이미 우리의 입지를 확보했으니, 옥탄과 지코프의 남은 떨거지들과 더 이상 함께 일하지 않아도 됩니다. 따라서, 안전을 위해 그들을 제거할 것입니다. 이들을 공직에서 전략적으로 퇴출하고 믿을만한 자로 신속하게 대체하기 위한 정부 직책 교체를 시행할 것입니다. 오직 완전히 충성스러운 정부만이 다가올 거대한 투쟁 앞에서 단결할 수 있을 것입니다."
 SAM_binds_to_break_shackles_to_smash: "부서지는 수갑, 분쇄되는 족쇄"
 SAM_binds_to_break_shackles_to_smash_desc: "우리는 적어도 우리 정부에 실질적인 위협을 가하지 않는 사람들에게 더 이상 원한을 가질 여유가 없다. 우리 교도소에서 처벌받고 있는 경쟁 정권의 전직 군인들은 우리 군대에서 복무하는 대가로 자유를 얻을 수 있을 것이다. 그들 중 일부는 이념적인 것에서부터 하찮은 것에 이르기까지 다양한 이유로 거절할 수 있지만, 대부분은 그렇지 않을 것이고, 이에 따라 우리 군대가 크게 성장할 기회를 제공할 것이다."
 SAM_you_can_trust_me_always: "너는 나를 믿을 수 있다. 언제든지."
 SAM_you_can_trust_me_always_desc: "Who Sergei Bunyachenko really is - that doesn't matter. What does matter is how people perceive him. As we have the opportunity to give the people our own perspective on this, we should take it. To the masses, Sergei Bunyachenko will be an honest, diligent soldier, somebody that anyone can strive to be like and somebody that can be reasoned with. That is, so long as his vision for Russia is followed. With that image projected by our government, it is hoped that the people will work harder, work together, and work for the great vision of Sergei Bunyachenko."
 SAM_just_a_few_bottles_nothing_more: "Just a Few Bottles, Nothing More"
 SAM_just_a_few_bottles_nothing_more_desc: "We have accomplished much of significance in the time since the bombings ended, and this is a fact worthy of celebration. We cannot overindulge, we have too much at stake to become lost in victories that pale in comparison to the struggles to come, and yet... there is no harm in allowing ourselves to relax ever so slightly. For the sake of the morale of our men, and because they have more than earned it, we shall allow some limited celebrations of our victories thus far."
 SAM_for_your_freedom_not_mine: "For Your Freedom, Not Mine"
 SAM_for_your_freedom_not_mine_desc: "Even now, there are some who resent the ROA, resent Bunyachenko himself, for their traitorous work for the Germans. We cannot begrudge them this, it is true. We betrayed Russia, and we can do nothing except try to one day earn her forgiveness. However, we must make one thing very clear to the people: they do not need to fight for Bunyachenko. So long as they fight for his vision, they do not need to love him. They do not fight for his own selfish interests, but for their own freedom from enslavement under the German boot."
 SAM_janus: "야누스"
 SAM_janus_desc: "There is nothing left, except for my state. From the former German prisoners who brought me so far, I have been propelled to the very heights of power in Russia. I lead a strong state, an unmistakably sovereign state that will reclaim what rightfully belongs to it. Even the Germans, deluded by all their own miserable propaganda, cannot help but fear this. Good; let them fear our coming. They have earned nothing less.\n\nI am Sergei Bunyachenko, and I will correct my mistakes."
 SAM_Smuta_Oktan: "동란시대 - 옥탄"
 SAM_a_kingdom_in_the_making: "A Kingdom in the Making"
 SAM_a_kingdom_in_the_making_desc: "Germany is engulfed in chaos, and the bombers have gone quiet. West Russia, for the first time in years, no longer has to fear the bombings.\n\nThis development is both good and bad - bad, because now the degenerate Russians will crawl out of their holes, and mobilize their rotten statelets to expand and butcher each other, as they are so prone to do. However, this affords the Russian Liberation Army the same opportunity - one I shall not squander.\n\nI, Mikhail Oktan, have been entrusted with the duty of transforming this broken, backwater nation into a proper state; a proper kingdom. This statelet of Samara may be my humble beginning, it is mine - and soon all Russia will be as well."
 SAM_the_king_himself: "The King Himself..."
 SAM_the_king_himself_desc: "To have a kingdom, one must have a king. Yet not just any king can rule effectively - the king must be strong, wise, rich, respected, and above all - absolute. A weak king will bring a nation to ruin, and be powerless as it slides into failure and degeneracy. I will permit no such thing.\n\nRussians are a backwards, weak, and degenerate people, who will be a tiring challenge to rule. A king does not choose his subjects - but he can shape them. With a strong German mind and arm to guide them, these people will learn the proper ways - willingly or otherwise.\n\nThrough my efforts, Russians will one day be proud National Socialists, and look at me with the respect I am owed. This is inevitable - I am certain of it."
 SAM_i_was_the_best_choice_no_doubt: "I Was the Best Choice, No Doubt!"
 SAM_i_was_the_best_choice_no_doubt_desc: "Vlasov's rule has ended.\n\nI, and everyone else knows and understands this, for his power, legitimacy, and authority has been transferred to me. Yet Vlasov still has a use, and what ruler discards a tool which can yet serve him? Vlasov cannot challenge me any longer, so I will utilize him further, and leave no question as to who is the rightful heir of Samara.\n\nStrangely, several trustworthy people have advised against this action. They fear that Vlasov is untrustworthy, and he and his allies might undermine or move against me.\n\nUtter nonsense. Such concerns can be dismissed, for if he had such thoughts, he would not have chosen me, would he?"
 SAM_sir_you_are_not_allowed_to_enter: "Sir, You Are Not Allowed to Enter"
 SAM_sir_you_are_not_allowed_to_enter_desc: "Vlasov has transferred his authority to me, but I cannot help but observe how they still treat him. They still look at him with respect. They go to him for advice. They quietly affirm my orders for his approval. If one was conspiratorial, one might wonder who truly rules Samara.\n\nIf Vlasov wants to play such games, then let us play.\n\nVlasov will be permanently removed from all places of influence. His rule has ended, and mine has begun - no one will threaten this. His remaining allies will certainly oppose it, as will those who remember him fondly - but this will resolve itself in time. Soon all will learn there is only one name in Samara that matters.\n\nAnd that name is Mikhail Oktan."
 SAM_a_most_expected_promotion: "A Most Expected Promotion"
 SAM_a_most_expected_promotion_desc: "The existing military structure of the Russian Liberation Army is a convoluted and tiring matter to deal with. Generals and officers bicker and argue over who is in charge - when the answer is obvious. These idiotic Russians forget who is in charge - so they must learn in a way they can understand.\n\nTo this end, the position of Head General of the Army will be created - a position I will be promoted to, of course. A position that is above all of other military ranks, so there is no more question of who commands it. I expect that, out of a desire to keep their power and authority, some disloyal officers will oppose this move, but they will fail.\n\nIt is a critical step into reforming the army into something truly patriotic - and has the secondary benefit of revealing who is truly loyal to me."
 SAM_service_is_optional_actually: "Service Is Optional, Actually"
 SAM_service_is_optional_actually_desc: "The wise men fill their ranks with the poor, degenerates, undesirables, and leeches of society. This is useful for solving several problems at once - one need not fear rebellion, treason, and insubordination from a poorer and more simple-minded army. The intelligent have other uses, not on the front lines.\n\nAdditionally, this provides an opportunity to ensure our coffers are always full.\n\nMen often bribed recruiters to avoid military service - I will formalize this process, by introducing a Patriotic Tax - which will allow recruits to pay to avoid conscription. This will, of course, lessen our military numbers - but without a doubt, I, and all those who are loyal, will be far wealthier than before!"
 SAM_toys_soldiers_and_patriotism: "장난감, 군인 그리고 애국심"
 SAM_toys_soldiers_and_patriotism_desc: "To gain the loyalty of men is a commendable thing, and to keep it is far simpler. For those generals who have remained loyal to me, I will ensure that they are well rewarded. For these men, the best means of ensuring their continued support is making sure they have enough toys to play with.\n\nGuns, medals, equipment, soldiers! I see their eyes light up like children as I hand their gifts one by one; a payment for service well-earned. And when the gifts are dispersed, I will set them loose upon Russia to play with their new toys, and generously utilizing the authority I have invested in them.\n\nI will let them have their fun - so long as they remain loyal."
 SAM_it_is_my_army: "이건 내 군대야"
 SAM_it_is_my_army_desc: "The ease by which I have been able to transform the rotten, incompetent, and disloyal army that Vlasov commanded has surprised even myself - and speaks to his incompetence. Ah, there is no use reminiscing on past failures of lesser men - the pieces are in place, and there is only one step left.\n\nAll of the changes, appointments, and policies will now be solidified through the sovereign text of law. While there is a certain ease in relying on unwritten rules and quiet arrangements, such are easy to break and exploit - and I have no intention of suffering either!\n\nLet the legal code make it clear for all - this army is mine, and it shall always answer to me!"
 SAM_and_all_those_below: "...and All Those Below"
 SAM_and_all_those_below_desc: "To have a truly good, prosperous, and wealthy kingdom, it must be one where people are happy - or at least, content.\n\nThere are two actions I will take to achieve this - the first will be taking steps to provide them the necessities needed to live. Men are easy to control, Russians even more so, and once I have provided for them, they will have no reason to oppose or question my rule - at least for the overwhelming majority.\n\nYet there are always going to be dissidents and those simply ungrateful. Thus, my second action will be to make sure that these traitors keep their mouths shut - either through fear, or by force."
 SAM_imagine_all_i_could_give_you: "Imagine All I Could Give You!.."
 SAM_imagine_all_i_could_give_you_desc: "A great king does not act alone, but also possesses a cadre of loyal dukes who support, advise, and assist in the rule of the kingdom. Loyalty is prized, dedication is rewarded, and for those who willingly and gratefully serve under me? Why, I will ensure that they are greatly rewarded.\n\nThere is no shortage of wealth and riches I possess, and for those who are deserving, they share in the spoils - while those who lack the loyalty or competence will be starved of it. This will certainly draw away some funds from various programs or institutions - but such things are nothing compared to the benefit of strong, loyal allies.\n\nAnd for those who still oppose me? Well, perhaps when they see the rewards of loyalty, and the punishments of defiance, they will be wise enough not to speak out of turn."
 SAM_or_do_to_you: "...or Do to You"
 SAM_or_do_to_you_desc: "The useful thing about loyalty is that when gained, it is difficult to lose. I have little reason to worry about those who are loyal to me - while there remain many who oppose my appointment, and subsequently defy my rule.\n\nUnacceptable. Intolerable. Contemptible. Pathetic.\n\nNo, I will not let these fools get away with this insolence. A ruler who lets his enemies challenge him without action is weak. As whispers and rumors compound, more and more will pounce on perceived weaknesses. From Bunyachenko to Zykov, each voice that opposes me must be crushed.\n\nAnd when such voices are silenced, then I will rest, knowing my rule is secure."
 SAM_protesting_is_just_not_beneficial: "Protesting Is Just Not Beneficial"
 SAM_protesting_is_just_not_beneficial_desc: "For protest to happen is to reveal a problem; for it to repeat is a failure. Any proper kingdom would possess a system of governance that would ensure that there is no need, desire, or capability to protest. This problem has been one which has long plagued men who rule nations - when the solution is deceptively simple.\n\nAllow me to explain.\n\nThose who declare themselves opposed to me? Who foolishly reveal their intentions through their antics? They will be dealt with, be they Jews, communists, democrats, and criminals; none will be spared. And when they are dealt with, so too is the problem of protest solved."
 SAM_running_with_empty_pockets: "Running With Empty Pockets"
 SAM_running_with_empty_pockets_desc: "To be a coward is one thing, to be a traitor is another - and the combination of the two produces something truly repulsive. Deserters are among the lowest of men, worthy of nothing but contempt. It is no surprise that many prefer to have them shot, or not even worth the effort to find in the first place.\n\nNo, death is too good for them. And these leeches will not live free in Russia. They will be found, and they will be made to serve.\n\nTheir lives will be made forfeit, and all that they have will be seized. They will be organized into divisions and placed on the front lines to fight and die in my name. A pragmatic plan, and if it shows clear benefits? There is no reason why other criminals and undesirables cannot be treated similarly in the future."
 SAM_a_road_for_everyone_to_drive_on: "A Road for Everyone to Drive On"
 SAM_a_road_for_everyone_to_drive_on_desc: "I am not ignorant of that which is said about me. That I am a simple tyrant. That I am an evil dictator. That I care nothing for the people I rule.\n\nNonsense! Nothing could be further from the truth!\n\nWho was it that has built the roads they drive on? Who commanded that the rails be refurbished? Who ensured that they can travel throughout this nation without fear or concern? For them to still complain after what I have given them? After what I paid for?\n\nIt is infuriating for these ungrateful peasants to still scorn me. Perhaps they would prefer someone less benevolent, and they may get a taste if they do not learn to appreciate what I have given them."
 SAM_a_state_for_everyone_to_serve: "A State for Everyone to Serve"
 SAM_a_state_for_everyone_to_serve_desc: "To build a government is no easy task - something even more apparent when one has to worry about spies, Jews, and traitors ready to infest it. Care must be taken in its design, subtlety in its intricacies. One fundamental truth is clear - Power in the hands of a few is dangerous - while power diluted can be controlled.\n\nAnd there are many who would do anything for just a sliver of power.\n\nSo this power will be spread far and wide. Ministries large and small will be formed at my command, open to all those who are willing to give their loyalty, and who are relentless in hunting the treasonous or undesirable - be they mere criminals or the Jewish spies who infest our lands."
 SAM_additional_pair_of_eyes_always_helps: "Additional Pair of Eyes Always Helps"
 SAM_additional_pair_of_eyes_always_helps_desc: "I do my best to remain vigilant and aware of the schemes and plans of my enemies - but there is a point where my vision becomes murky, and I cannot perceive the blades in the dark. Thus, I must take measures lest I find this dagger plunged into my back.\n\nA new agency will be created; a secret intelligence apparatus filled with only the most capable and loyal. But I cannot be too careful here - especially with such an important tool. And even loyal men must prove their competence.\n\nThey will be tasked with finding as many weapons and military equipment as they can - from our allies, enemies, or citizens - and ensure that it reaches our army. Those who succeed will have proven their dedication - and those who have not will find their careers short indeed."
 SAM_i_remember_our_pact_kaminski: "I Remember Our Pact, Kaminski"
 SAM_i_remember_our_pact_kaminski_desc: "Ah, Kaminski. For over two decades now, we have worked together. I supported your endeavors in Moskowien, and you ensured I remained a counterbalance to Vlasov. Now Vlasov is gone, and I have succeeded - though my work has only just begun.\n\nThe pact we made remains, Kaminski - And it will not end until all of Russia is under my rule. In times like these we learn how reliable our partners truly are - and you are a reliable partner, are you not? Business partners support each other - especially if promises have been made. I ask not for charity, but a fair price for your support.\n\nPay no mind to the grumbles and whispers you may hear from those who will turn their nose up at your support. They do not matter, not anymore. I will await your answer, Kaminski - and I assure you, I will not forget it."
 SAM_how_else_do_i_educate_them: "How Else Do I Educate Them?"
 SAM_how_else_do_i_educate_them_desc: "The way the modern leader speaks to the people is no longer just through speeches, but through words. Newspapers are an older form of media, but in this desolate Russia, it is all people have. The paper Речь has served well as the source of proper National Socialist news - an endeavor I remain quite proud of, but sadly it remains unknown to most of the public.\n\nIt is time to change that - and in a way that will grab attention.\n\nStories don't need to be true to have an intended effect. We will prepare a \"terrorist\" attack, and it will be this paper which reveals the truth of the culprits - communist terrorists, of course. With some subtlety, planning, and a useful narrative, I will not only dominate the media landscape with an outlet I control - but eliminate a few troublemakers at the same time."

 SAM_for_your_stab_in_the_back_you_will_die_desc: "Laziness. Treason. Failure.\n\nThese results are unacceptable. The war is being lost, and this cannot be allowed to continue. But who is to blame for this? I have made no mistake but believing that those I relied on could do the job. Now they have exposed themselves as woefully unfit for their positions - be it through incompetence or sabotage.\n\nI will not lose this war, and there will be consequences for those who have brought us to this point.\n\nThose who are responsible for this catastrophe will be dealt with - publicly and permanently. In their place will rise true, loyal, and competent patriots. Once the rot has been excised from this state, there will be nothing to stop our march to victory."
 SAM_cant_say_no_to_all_the_lights: "Can't Say \"No\" to All the Lights"
 SAM_cant_say_no_to_all_the_lights_desc: "The armies marche forward, claiming victory after victory. With every city taken, with every pretender who falls, it demonstrates that not only are we unstoppable - victory is inevitable.\n\nThis once-humble statelet is now firmly on the path to greatness. All of West Russia is falling to us, be they democrats, communists, kings, or pretenders. They cannot stand before the army I have raised, or the state I have built. Some may call celebrations premature, and ask that caution be exercised - but why should they be listened to?\n\nNo! A celebration will be held for our inevitable victory. Let all who have come this far partake in the spoils and celebration! No expense will be spared, and all of Russia shall hear of this event - and despair, for they know I have won."
 SAM_a_kingdom_almost_made: "A Kingdom Almost Made"
 SAM_a_kingdom_almost_made_desc: "It is done.\n\nThe dissidents have been silenced. The traitors have been purged. One by one those who stood in the way were crushed under the might of my army. Obstacle after obstacle has been overcome. They whispered when they thought I could not hear. They questioned. They doubted. They plotted. They feared.\n\nToday, these whispers have been silenced. West Russia is mine.\n\nThis kingdom rests upon a firm foundation, with the path before me clear. This is only the start. The west is mine, but there remains an entire nation left to claim.

 SAM_all_these_dreams_and_hopes_of_mine_desc: "Zykov now stands above Bunyachenko and Oktan and is now second only to Vlasov in the KONR hierarchy. Zykov has worked tirelessly to reach this point - and now is the time to make use of his newfound power.\n\nThe original vision of the KONR - a force for a free, democratic and anti-communist Russia, lies deep under layers of rot. Each reform that Zykov implements, each strike at the German adjacent and militarist factions, and each foe that we vanquish will burn away this rot. Our reforms will range from the separation of the military and government, the gradual introduction of elections from the bottom and slowly upwards, and the evolution of our fledgling government into a mighty eagle!\n\nStill - we must be vigilant. Vlasov's favor is not enough to entirely protect us from the attacks by the adjacent factions, and his power continues to slip with age. Power that must be swiftly absorbed, if our regime is to survive."

 SAM_my_party_but_where_should_you_be_desc: "The KONR is too central to the current administration to be kept as is. Hardline generals of the ROA and their cliques litter its ranks, making the risk of a move against Zykov too significant to ignore. As we transition to a civilian administration, so too must the KONR. It will realize its vision as a real political party of sorts , with Zykov front and center - and the placement of others within it entirely under his discretion.\n\nThe question remains of where Vlasov himself will fall within this new hierarchy. A powerless figurehead? An eternal President? Or merely an advisor to he who truly holds all the cards - Miletiy Zykov.\n\nWhatever the case, his place will, in all practical sense, be the same - powerless and only serving our ends."
 SAM_as_our_first_and_foremost_chairman: "As Our First And Foremost Chairman"
 SAM_as_our_first_and_foremost_chairman_desc: "While it could be argued that Vlasov's decision to serve as head of the ROA and KONR was one based entirely on his own survival - as most of his actions may have been - he has still been instrumental in the formation of a new Russia, and will be remembered primarily for that reason. His misgivings and mistakes will fade with time - that Zykov can make sure of.\n\nFor these reasons, Vlasov will stand as a figurehead of the new party, its honorary leader and first chairman. Of course, all the power will lie with Zykov, but Vlasov's credentials and sway over the KONR will only strengthen our position.\n\nWhile this isn't the case today, perhaps in a few decades he will be seen as a titan on the same level as Peter the Great or Alexander Nevsky. A little propaganda can go a long way."
 SAM_you_can_provide_advice_thats_all: "You Can Provide Advice, That's All"
 SAM_you_can_provide_advice_thats_all_desc: "Outside of our little corner of Russia, and even within it - Vlasov has not been a popular figure. Many see him as instrumental in the continuation of Russia's new Time of Troubles, allowing the Germans to triumph over the nation, whether Bolsheviks controlled that nation or not.\n\nSidelining Vlasov into an unimportant and purely ceremonial role could help dispel some of the stigmas many Russians have of KONR, and show Zykov as a fresh face, divorced from the controversial decisions of the past.\n\nOf course, this isn't the main reason for sideling Vlasov. His previous command over the ROA serves as a threat to Zykov's newfound power. Isolating the Old General can only help Zykov tighten his grip on the new party, and show it as a truly new force - one fighting for a free and just Russia."
 SAM_popular_structures_of_freedom: "Popular Structures of Freedom"
 SAM_popular_structures_of_freedom_desc: "Zykov's relaxation of previous political restrictions has quickly led to the formation of new dissident parties, who represent both a threat and an opportunity.\n\nTheir presence helps legitimize Zykov's turning of a new leaf, and their opposition to Nazi collaboration and stratocracy align with Zkyov's, and allow him another bulwark against his real opponents. Of course, these new parties could serve as an outlet for public dissatisfaction with Zykov's new regime, but he will never let it come to that.\n\nThese new parties should be allowed to blossom under a watchful eye - for now at least. Zykov's proactive reforms have earned him near immunity from any critique. Attacking him would be seen as political suicide. Dare these parties defame Zykov - they will be destroyed at the ballot box, and perhaps more covertly - through Zykov's hand."
 SAM_spokespersons_of_national_defence: "Spokespersons of National Defence"
 SAM_spokespersons_of_national_defence_desc: "As our statelet transitions from military to civilian, the question arises - where should all those former military men go? It is best to keep them around in some capacity. After all, we have a country to reunify and wars to fight, but this must be done in a way to minimize their political power. Thus Zykov has decided to allow these groups their own parties outside of the main KONR, and some token representation to satiate their lust for power, while conceding little of it ourselves.\n\nNow that the Germans that back Oktan, and the militarists that back Bunyachenko, are sectioned off, these two can be further marginalized until none of the old ROA can truly threaten Zykov's position again. They will have an outlet to speak their minds, but this will lead nowhere, only legitimizing the portrayal of a fair and open society. Whatever they try, Zykov will endure!"
 SAM_a_peoples_army_not_a_militia: "A Peoples Army, Not a Militia!"
 SAM_a_peoples_army_not_a_militia_desc: "Despite our efforts, the ROA remains far too strong of a force. To further mitigate their influence on our burgeoning statelet, we must go further! The ROA still lies somewhat outside the civilian government and should be brought into it. The President will now control several of its previous functions directly, and many of its former officers will be demoted to meaningless positions. Furthermore, to create a counterweight against the ROA we will establish further non-ROA brigades - we cannot entirely rely on a bunch of German sympathizers and opportunistic generals!\n\nWe must be cautious. Moving too fast could upset the frail balance that makes up our government. Losing the faith of the ROA membership now could see defeat against the adjacent statelets, or worse - an attack from the inside."
 SAM_an_overarching_party: "An Overarching Party"
 SAM_an_overarching_party_desc: "Our blossoming political scene has given those originally less sympathetic to our regime far more faith in its ability to represent them. While a great benefit to stability in the short term, perhaps this has gone slightly too far. The new political parties will be permitted to continue, but now they will exist under the broader umbrella of Zykov's new KONR.\n\nThis will strike a balance between genuine democracy, particularly on the local level, while maintaining Zykov's grip. As Russia continues to endure its time of troubles and constantly warring, a fullscale democratic society is simply impossible. Our people should be grateful for what voice they have."
 SAM_guiding_and_aligning_my_people: "Guiding and Aligning My People"
 SAM_guiding_and_aligning_my_people_desc: "Zykov is a master at influencing public opinion. This was his job after all! Now this job is even more important. Crushing dissent with force does not fly anymore and will not be necessary in Zykov's Russia. Still - with the liberalization of our political system, the ideas of the people need to be guided and molded, aligning with Russia's best interest.\n\nForce was still necessary when a military junta ruled us, but now public opinion is a far more powerful tool. With promises of democracy - even if just a mirage, Russians will be far more engaged in the well-being of our statelet and become far more susceptible to the propaganda that Zykov expels."
 SAM_vote_for_resources_elect_your_security: "Vote For Resources, Elect Your Security"
 SAM_vote_for_resources_elect_your_security_desc: "The Russian people are not used to democracy. Only for a brief few months in 1917 did they snatch a whiff of it - before the reds seized on it. If we truly wish to create a free and democratic Russia, its people must be weaned onto democracy starting from the bottom up. Local elections and referendums will help motivate the people, as they'll see the impacts of their decisions in real-time - and be less impacted by the ongoing integration of the rest of our fractured motherland as national politics would.\n\nOf course, this is only half the reason for keeping the democratic process at lower levels. Fractured and disparate local jurisdictions prove little threat to Zkykov's government at the top. Perhaps one day, the Russian people will have a complete democracy - but this may not come for some time yet."
 SAM_fill_those_vacant_positions_now: "Fill Those Vacant Positions Now!"
 SAM_fill_those_vacant_positions_now_desc: "A new democracy brings a new bureaucracy. One with ample positions at every layer of government - with some more meaningful than others. This grants us an opportunity to deal with our opposition - not by 'disappearing them' or throwing them out - but by simply delegating them to meaningless positions and barraging them with books, not bullets. Seeing such 'luxurious' treatment of many dissidents can further restore the faith of Russians in our government, knowing we genuinely care about the values we espouse.\n\nDeeply embedded in the bureaucracy, we will always have eyes on our enemies - with loyal officials surveying their every move, a move against us will be impossible, and we can turn our eyes outwards to the threats that lie beyond our borders. Granting more opportunities to expand this new bureaucracy even further."
 SAM_every_regime_has_its_outliers: "Every Regime Has Its Outliers"
 SAM_every_regime_has_its_outliers_desc: "Citizens of our new republic have noticed the loosening of our grip. More and more people are beginning to speak out - first as a whisper and, for some, eventually a shout. Still, much of the public continues with their lives, passively supporting the regime. While this tumor remains benign, it could cause far more harm extracting it now. In fact, having a group of outliers criticizing the regime could be beneficial - seeing their cries of dictatorship and repression be answered by silence would show them as the fools they are.\n\nWhen Zykov liberates the rest of Russia while dissidents peck at his feet - it will only further prove our strength and our tolerance. Any other bolshevik or idiosyncratic megalomaniac would've mowed them down by now - they are lucky to live in such a free society."

 SAM_how_much_power_do_you_want_desc: "Money, for good or for ill, talks. The corporations and big businesses of Samara have traditionally been in the pockets of Oktan, but with the kleptocrat sidelined, their allegiance is up for grabs. People will grumble, no doubt, but we cannot deny that the corporations represent a sizable and powerful faction in our slice of Russia. Inviting them to the table, discreetly, of course, to evaluate what their demands are could allow Zykov to strike an accord before they become our enemies."
 SAM_advocating_an_era_of_mass_politics: "Advocating an Era of Mass Politics"
 SAM_advocating_an_era_of_mass_politics_desc: "To the Russians, popular sovereignty has remained a peculiar Western notion. Languishing under tsars, communist dictators, and now warlords, the Russians had little hope of realizing their own desires until now. Many have claimed to act in the best interest of the people, but who knows better their own desires than the people themselves? Zykov will keep his promises, and we will aid in establishing grassroots democratic movements. This may seem counterproductive, but helping to kickstart political parties shows our dedication to democracy, even if those same parties may oppose us down the line. Our promises are more important than our grasp on power and the people will recognize us for who we really are."
 SAM_the_intelligentsia_know_best_under_me: "The Intelligentsia Know Best Under Me"
 SAM_the_intelligentsia_know_best_under_me_desc: "The intelligentsia have always been Zykov's people. The thinkers, artists, teachers, scholars, and philosophers have sat in our corner from the very beginning. Now that Samara has begun to open up to democracy, the threat of elections now looms. Multiple parties have appeared, each vying for the future of Russia. The intelligentsia, as they are want to do, eagerly launch themselves at every novel idea and new ideology. While this is charming, we would not want their enthusiasm to damage our own powerbase. Zykov will yank the leash, integrating the intelligentsia back into our own party. Let us put them to work on Zykov's vision through promises of pensions, scholarships, and buildings and parks in their name. Better that they aid us rather than our opponents."

No longer the sole foundations of our government, their influence has been challenged by the newly established civilian-controlled institutions and parties. Where generals once made decisions, now a new branch of civilian experts stands, ready to assume control.\n\nWhile this is a continuous process, these initial steps in changing the power dynamic of the state will help us on the long journey of becoming a proper Republic, complete with a fully functioning government.\n\nPerhaps with this in place, we may finally be able to present ourselves as the true successor to Kerensky's government."
 SAM_allocate_resources_for_ballots: "Allocate Resources For Ballots"
 SAM_allocate_resources_for_ballots_desc: "The trouble with Democracy is that you have to rely on millions of individuals working in tandem to make your system work. Too many \"democracies\" only care about the opinions of the elite or the cosmopolitan crust of society. Ignorance leads to resentment, resentment leads to anger, and anger leads to extremism. That's the way it has always been.\n\nThat's why it's so crucial that every man and woman gets the ability to vote, no matter where they live. They could live in Novosibirsk or Norilsk, it does not matter. What matters is that even our most humble of citizens can cast their vote in a free society. A society that is...how the Americans say it...run by the people, for the people."

We have come too far for our beloved Russia to fall victim to the vices of extremism and chronic incompetence. Russia may be a democracy, but we will not go out like Weimar did - trapped in an endless cycle of cruelty and despair.\n\nThat's why it's so crucial that we guide the people on who they should vote for, when it comes down to the ballot. We could have a nice, sensible party that has moderate views on tariffs and the Gold Standard. On the other hand, there's always the chance that it results in a totalitarian hellstate run by bandits disguised as glad-handed politicians. By giving them a nice, controlled selection of parties, we can make sure that the people don't do anything idiotic. Not that they would, of course."
 SAM_a_few_more_options_cant_hurt: "A Few More Options Can't Hurt"
 SAM_a_few_more_options_cant_hurt_desc: "No, the solution to Democracy's flaws is not \"freedom\", or \"representation\". It is a matter of choice. America has only a few parties to choose from, while Japan and Germany had only one! The latter aren't democracies, but America is not a model Republic. In their quest for true \"liberty\", they have found themselves in a rut, where many are disillusioned with the binary choice that they're given.\n\nOur solution is simple. Give them more choices! It does not matter that these parties answer to us, what matters is that their subtle differences in minutiae attract our people into voting for them. Our people will be so consumed in debating minor details, that they'll cease to argue about our \"lack of democracy\". Insolent jabber, of course. Streamlining democracy is hardly the same thing as destroying it."

While there are certainly many who wish to participate in these elections, the fact is that allowing uncertain or unknown elements - be they supposedly friendly to us or not - into the delicate mechanisms of governance risks more discord than stability.\n\nFree elections of course remain a priority for the future - but for now it is too risky. We will still maintain the elections, but we will ensure that the options are limited only to those who we are certain will not disrupt the existing order. Until our state is in a stable place, such measures must be maintained.\n\nThe transition to democracy is a process, and right now we are only on the first step."

A new hope for Russia has emerged, one that is strong, stable, and triumphant.\n\nNow that we have won, and order properly restored, we will begin the process of elections. All of the parties we have approved will now put forward their candidates, and the people of Russia will soon take part in a free, and very fair vote. "
