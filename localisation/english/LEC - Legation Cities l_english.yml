 lec.1.d: "Formed under the shadow of a possible German-Japanese war by American mediation, the International Mandate for the Chinese Concessions, colloquially known as the Legation Cities, is emblematic of both the failure of China to successfully resist foreign imperialism and the American push for the 'Open Door' policy, under which all nations should have equal access to one of the world's largest markets. Shanghai's reach goes beyond her limits, and beyond the thirty mile 'neutral zone' that has become a haven for criminals, all the way up the Yangtze in a sprawling path of railroads, factories and telegraph lines that forms the beating heart of Chinese industry. Money comes and goes like water in the cities at all levels of society.\n\nTo the north Tianjin is the world's entrepôt for Beijing and a thriving hub of railway speculation for all of China, to the south is old Hong Kong: a last guttering ember of British glory kept alive by her fine harbour and access to southern China. At the beating heart of it all lies Shanghai, a diamond plucked from the hands of China and polished to a mirror shine. The Paris of the East is in its heyday, the streets hum with electricity, the opium dens curl with mysterious smoke and the westerners spend money like it is going out of fashion and make it just as fast.\n\nAll of course, is not as it appears. Under the golden surface of Shanghai lies a terrifying underbelly of murder, intrigue and revolution."

 lec.29.a: "Welcome to a front-row seat on your exploitation!"
 lec.30.t: "공사관이사회: 내년 예산안 투표"
 lec.30.d: "The [GetYear] budget is going to expire within two months, and the Legation Council members have been called together to decide on the focus for next year. With the instability in China threatening to overflow into our borders, some have recommended focusing on the military and defence. Others have recommended increasing funds in the other facets of conflict, taking in refugees and keeping good relations with Beijing. Yet another suggestion is to focus on ridding ourselves of the last malingering effects of Black Monday. What should we choose?"
 lec.30.a: "예산만 두둑하게 챙기면 될 것이다."
 lec.30.b: "We should devote more funding towards the volunteer force."

 lec.31.t: "공사관이사회의 운영권 확대"
 lec.31.d: "The Legation Council has recently renewed its focus on expanding the profits of free trade for all its member states. They have encouraged Chinese manufactures to lower their prices, promising them to compensate in other ways, while they have encouraged other middlemen to lower tariffs as well. As such, our businesses are now reaping the fruits of Chinese labour."
 lec.31.a: "Our workers will enjoy the holiday."
 lec.32.t: "Anti-Concessionists Attack Inland Concessions!"
 lec.32.d: "During the fallout of the League War, several international concessions in inland China, such as the ones in Hangkow, Xiamen, and Chinkiang, have been raided by anti-concessionist troops and bandits. It seems that Nanjing is not going to win the war quickly and without damage to international property. Thus, the Legation Council has authorised the International Volunteer Force to be deployed to the inland concessions, to defend them against the Kuomintang and anti-concessionist rabble."
 lec.32.a: "Deploy the Force throughout China."
 lec.33.t: "청 조정의 반조계주의 지원!"
 lec.33.d: "In response to the secession of Anhui Province from the Southern Zhili League of Eight Provinces, the Qing government in Beijing has decided to support the Anqing Clique. The Zhili government hopes to utilise the popular anti-concessionism throughout inland China to boost their government’s popularity, it seems. Unfortunately for the Zhili, they also have cut themselves off from German help and recognition."
 lec.33.a: "이런 세상에!"
 lec.34.t: "Volunteer Force Officers Protest Overspecialisation"
 lec.34.d: "After our recent installation alongside the Germans of coastal defences in our minor cities, several members of our Volunteer Force Officer Corps have come forward, presenting a proposal for transitioning several of the newly built coastal fortifications into land-based ones. They claim that overinvesting in naval defences could leave us vulnerable to a Chinese attack from the land. Should we adopt their proposal?"
 lec.34.a: "They are right, we should adopt their plans."
 lec.34.b: "The Chinese would never dare attack us!"
 lec.35.t: "상하이에 병력을 파견한 독일"
 lec.35.d: "Citing security concerns following the collapse of the German ally in Nanjing, the Germans have sent more troops to the volunteer force in Shanghai, as well as reinforcing their own divisions in the Cities. This has increased German popularity in the Cities, as well as boosting our manpower."
 lec.35.a: "We can always use more men, I suppose."
 lec.36.t: "공사관 도시의 종말"
 lec.36.d: "The Legation Cities once stood as a symbol of the stability brought by free markets, the 'Open Door' from the west into China. Now, with the collapse of their military, their diplomatic and economic agency has shrivelled to zero. While the Mandate may still exist on paper, for all intents and purposes, the Legation Cities are gone, and so are the benefits from our concessions they provided."
 lec.36.a: "It served us well, but now its time has passed."
 lec.37.t: "공사관 도시의 라이히스팍트 가입 요청"
 lec.37.d: "The theoretical web of international guarantees of the Legation Cities' integrity have always been of doubtful security. With our diplomat in Shanghai acting as the head of the Legation Council, the Cities have applied to join our alliance. They shall be a useful tool to fight off the Japanese, surely, but some argue they will drag us into unwinnable wars in China."

 lec.40.t: "독일의 [BEL.GetName] 축출 요구!"
 lec.40.d: "Since [BEL.GetName] has left the German sphere of influence, the Germans have raised a motion in the Legation Council to remove the [BEL.GetAdjective]s and confiscate their concession, citing their 'obvious international instability."
 lec.40.a: "Let's put it to a vote."

 lec.40.c: "That makes sense to me."
 lec.41.t: "[LEC.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Remove [BEL.GetNameDef]"
 lec.41.d: "It seems that the Legation Council has refused to even consider the idea of removing [BEL.GetName] from the Council, completely dismissing our references to obvious [BEL.GetAdjective] instability as \"petty complaints,\" unworthy of their time."
 lec.41.a: "That council is completely biased against us!"
 lec.42.t: "[LEC.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Remove [BEL.GetNameDef]"
 lec.42.d: "The Legation Council has seen the obvious instability and erraticism of [BEL.GetName], and has accordingly confiscated its concessions in Tianjin and the mainland of China in the name of the Beijing government. They have also removed the [BEL.GetAdjective] government from the Legation Council, all without anyone else being able to say a single thing in open session! This is a clear coup for German diplomacy!"
 lec.42.a: "They saw sense."
 lec.43.t: "아국의 조계지를 몰수한 공사관이사회"
 lec.43.d: "Since we escaped from the German sphere of influence, the Germans have been diplomatically isolating us in every way possible. We have had high tariffs exporting to all countries in Mitteleuropa, we have been forced out of the Reichspakt, and Antwerp has been almost severed from our grasp. As the latest item in the long list of insults, it seems the Germans have successfully petitioned to have us removed from the Legation Council in Shanghai. While our Chinese concessions were never truly a priority, this offence still rankles. On a more positive note, we are no longer responsible for many of the French nationals in the Cities that we previously extended citizenship to."
 lec.43.a: "애초에 우린 톈진 따위에 관심 없었다."
 lec.44.t: "공사관이사회의 [BEL.GetNameDefCap] 축출"
 lec.44.d: "The Germans have been diplomatically isolating Brussels since the [BEL.GetAdjective]s kicked out the German monarch and garrisons in the [BEL.GetAdjective] Revolution. The latest step has been to persuade the High Commissioner of [LEC.GetNameDef] to confiscate [BEL.GetName]'s concessions in the name of the Beijing government and remove them from the Legation Council. The strict correctness of this move, held without a vote, has been questioned by many in Shanghai, but for now the German coup is fait accompli."
 lec.44.a: "They never cared, really..."
 lec.45.t: "[BEL.GetNameDef]의 조계지 몰수 안건에 의결하기 시작한 이사회"
 lec.45.d: "The High Commissioner has moved to consider the German ambassador's request for [BEL.GetName]'s removal from the Council. It is likely that all parties who wish to dominate the Council will vote to remove an unnecessary, possibly hostile, third party from the Council, while those who espouse multi-polarism, such as the British, Austrians, and Americans will probably vote no. Only time will tell."
 lec.45.a: "Time and chance happens to them all."
 lec.46.t: "벨기에 축출 안건에 의결하기 시작한 이사회"
 lec.46.d: "The Germans have been diplomatically isolating Brussels since the [BEL.GetAdjective]s kicked out the German monarch and garrisons in the [BEL.GetAdjective] Revolution. The latest step has been to persuade the High Commissioner of [LEC.GetNameDef] to hold a vote on confiscating [BEL.GetName]'s concessions in the name of the Beijing government and removing them from the Legation Council. This could possibly reshape the power dynamic of the Legation Council for years to come."

 lec.48.d.flanders: "With the dissolution of the Belgian government, the status of their concessions has fallen into doubt. The Chinese government has consented to grant a new concession to neither the Flemish government nor the Belgian government-in-exile in Canada, and it seems the small Belgian outpost in Tianjin has fallen back into Chinese hands, though it will naturally still be administered by the Legation Cities for now."
 lec.48.d.syndies: "With the revolution in Belgium, the status of their concessions has fallen into doubt. The Belgian government has informed the Mandate that they will no longer wish to participate in an imperialist structure. The Chinese government has not consented to grant the concession to the Belgian government-in-exile in Canada, so it seems the small Belgian outpost in Tianjin has fallen back into Chinese hands, though it will naturally still be administered by the Legation Cities for now."
 lec.48.a: "Confiscate that warehouse!"
 lec.49.t: "벨기에 조계지의 운명"
 lec.49.d.flanders: "As the legal successor to many of Flanders-Wallonia's overseas commitments, we were expecting to succeed the Belgians in their position on the Legation Council, as well. Instead, it seems that the International Mandate has declared that the concessions have reverted to the Chinese government, and we no longer have any rights or responsibilities in China. Naturally, this is something of a diplomatic disappointment, but at least we don't have to take care of all those Francophones in the Legation Cities any more."
 lec.49.d.syndies: "Since our revolution, many in our government have urged [ROOT.GetLeader] to abrogate our responsibilities to the imperialist Legation Council. Now he finally has, and though we may no longer have unfettered access to Chinese markets we at least have the moral high ground."
 lec.49.a: "속이 다 시원하군!"
 lec.50.t: "몰수된 벨기에 조계지"
 lec.50.d: "It seems the Legation Council has confiscated Flanders-Wallonia's concessions and removed their ambassador from the Council. Though theoretically their concessions now revert back to us, it is likely that the Legation Council will now administer them, since they lie in the neutral zone in Tianjin. Indeed, it is not impossible that another consular power may attempt to buy them from us or the Council. For now, though, many privately rejoice at the end of one of the unequal treaties."

 lec.51.b: "투표없이 놈들을 제적시켜라."
 lec.52.t: "공사관이사회에서 퇴출당한 우리나라"
 lec.52.d: "The Legation Council has stepped beyond its bounds completely, apparently. In closed session, without any of our delegates present or informed, the Legation Council has speedily removed the Empire of Japan from the Council! The audacity of this arrangement is furthered by the fact that the Legation Council was originally supposed to be a platform for mediation between ourselves, the Chinese, and the Germans, and now a crucial party is gone. Our government and diplomatic corps have only learned about this development in the morning papers, and we are being called upon by the army to put together a coherent response, one that will doubtless give the military a mandate to strike the Cities and end Western domination of China once and for all."
 lec.52.a: "이건 미친 짓이야!"
 lec.53.t: "공사관이사회의 일본 축출"
 lec.53.d: "The German High Commissioner, and thus the Legation Council, has removed the Japanese Empire from the Legation Council today. This has predictably infuriated the Japanese, who are demanding an apology and immediate restoration of their rights, both of which seem unlikely. Many nations have already withdrawn their guarantees from the Legation Cities, having no wish to defend the Cities from the probable Japanese attack. What should we do?"

Now it seems that even the Legation Cities have failed to stop the Japanese aggression in Asia. The Council has asserted itself and the High Commissioner has started a vote to remove the Japanese from the Council. How should we vote?"
 lec.55.d.jap: "The Legation Council has treacherously entertained a motion to remove us from the Council! We have done absolutely nothing to merit this treatment, but these westerners seem determined to isolate our great Empire once again. If we are to escape diplomatic isolation, our men in Shanghai must move quickly to prevent this measure from passing."

 lec.59.t: "북경정변"
 lec.59.d: "Instability in the Qing central government seems to have lead to dramatic regime change in Beijing. Power has always been held by Wu Peifu and his Zhili Clique, but now it seems they have lost power to a renewed imperial faction, backed by friendly warlords to the south-east and west. As part of this transition, the new regime has blamed foreign meddling for the prior power struggle, and many in the Legation Cities now fear that a new era of official anti-concessionism has begun in the north. Some now call for withdrawing diplomatic recognition of the Qing government, and recognising either the Southern Zhili or the Fengtian Cliques as the legitimate government of China."
 lec.59.a: "Let's hope things get a little better."
 lec.60.t: "외환보유고 탕진"
 lec.60.d: "The Legation Council's day-to-day functions rely heavily on the currency reserves in the Shanghai Banking Corporation's vaults. These, unfortunately, have run rather low, and the prevailing uncertainty in the world means that the Cities have almost no credit to run on. Without money, the Legation Cities could probably not continue to function normally. If we do not increase the money in our vault soon, the Council might have to terminate its Mandate."
 lec.60.a: "Hopefully things won't get that bad."
 lec.61.t: "위원회의 파산 선언"
 lec.61.d: "After some days of hard deliberation, the Council had made a decision. The Legation Cities have conclusively failed as a project. There is no money in the reserves, the powers' interests are not being served, and average quality of life is plummeting. Thus, the International Mandate over all Chinese concessions was determined to have ended, and negotiations with the Beijing government would begin. City commissioners vehemently objected to this decision, as well as many bureaucrats, but the ambassadors have left the Council chamber and returned to their own residences, guarded by national troops. In the streets, Japanese and German troops have already begun making aggressive moves, and the Chinese are in the streets all through the Cities. Soon, chaos will overtake us."

Their arrogance and dishonest play have been widely known by the well-informed in Shanghai, even as they claim to trumpet the cause of global stability and cooperation. Now, it seems, the Legation Council has decided to remove them from what parts of China it feels it legally can. Should we take the opportunity to strike a blow at the world hegemon, or is it too risky?"
 lec.85.d.ger: "The Legation Council has begun voting on a motion to remove our Kaiserreich from the Chinese concessions administered by them, and to expel our diplomats from the Council!

 lec.91.d: "The Legation Cities were meant as a forum for all powers with concessions in China to jointly guarantee a free trade zone in several eastern cities.

The High Commissioner has invoked Article 14, and the Legation Council has gathered to decide the fate of the Mandate. While the Americans, naturally, wish to return to preeminence over the Cities, their country is hardly in a better state than Germany is. The British urge the Council turn to them, for though they, too, are in exile, they at least have shown their longevity in it. Others in the Cities' bureaucracy have instead attempted to convince High Commissioner Bodenheimer that the time for foreign control over the Cities is done. Should we grant them their request? Or are the Cities too precious to fall back into the chaotic hands of the Chinese?"

He then was relieved of his duties, and returned to his embassy to make the journey back home to find what employment the new regime can provide for him.

 lec.107.d: "The League of Left-Wing Writers was formed in 1933 in Shanghai, possibly at the instigation of the Kuomintang, under the influence of the famous author Lu Xun. The stated purpose of the group was to advance the cause of socialist realism in China, and they saw no issue with using art to deliver overtly political statements. Indeed, they have frequently had heated debates with the Crescent Moon Society, an influential literary group that argues that art should only be made for art's sake. Recently, however, they have stepped up their propaganda campaign for the Left Kuomintang, and with those fighters still active in Fujian, it has, in the view of some members of the Council and the police, become a threat to the Mandate. What should be done about these mischief-makers?"

 lec.108.d: "With the defeat or removal of all members of the Legation Council, the International Mandate for the Chinese Concessions now serves no purpose. Although many exiles and expats would prefer that the cities remain independent, under their own government, without international protection it is doubtful such a minority-rule state could survive in this tumultuous region. Consequently, High Commissioner [LEC.GetLeader] has made the decision to return the cities occupied by the Mandate to the Chinese government."

 lec.109.d.success: "Following our subjugation at the hands of the Japanese, the Legation Council has decided that we are no longer worthy of having a seat in their ranks in Shanghai. In fact, Ivan Luganets-Orelsky, our ambassador in Shanghai, has defected to the Moscow regime, in order to keep his comfortable lifestyle. This is in general emblematic of our falling international legitimacy, and our transformation into just another part of the Japanese Empire."
 lec.109.d.fail: "Following our subjugation at the hands of the Japanese, the Muscovite ambassador at the Legation Council has attempted to convince the rest of that body that we are no longer worthy of having a seat in their ranks in Shanghai. Happily, however, he failed, possibly due to Japanese influence. As such, we are still recognised as a possible Russian government internationally."

 lec.110.t: "트란스아무르의 의결권 복권?"
 lec.110.d: "When the Legation Cities were founded, Russia, as a nation with Chinese concessions, was naturally given voting rights on the Council. Unfortunately, there were two Russias at the time. While Kerenskiy's Russian Republic had more international recognition, Admiral Kolchak's Vladivostok regime was far closer, being able to actually occupy the concessions, and had the support of Tokyo. This resulted in both governments being granted the same sort of observer rights given to the Canadians and Australasians. Now that the eastern [TRM.GetNameDef] is indisputably the only Russia remaining which has any interest in maintaining its position in Tianjin, however, the ambassador from Vladivostok has urged us to restore voting rights to his government.\n\nSince this is quite a substantive matter, it is technically supposed to go through the Legation Council. However, since it is unlikely that Germany, a rival of the Russians and Japanese, would ever let it pass, we can instead simply let the Chair of the Legation Council push it through on a Point of Order. While this would provide a powerful new voter with no ties to the Germans, and would please the Japanese, it would probably upset some powers on the Council."

Now that the latter has been eliminated from the world stage, however, it would seem only proper for the Russian voting rights to be restored to the legitimate eastern government. However, Transamur is undoubtedly a geopolitical threat to the nations of Eurasia, and some question if it would be wise to so easily grant them more influence."

 lec.112.d: "For years, we have had only observer rights on the Legation Council in Shanghai, even though we have Chinese concessions. They claimed that the reason for this disrespect were the competing claims between Transamur and Kerensky's Moscow regime. Now that the latter can no longer dispute our claim to be the one true White Russia, however, the Chair has decided to call for a vote on whether or not to restore our rights. If there is any justice in this world, we will naturally regain them, but we cannot discount the malice and jealousy of Berlin."

While this is undoubtedly correct procedure, not consulting the Council for a vote sets a worrying precedent, and threatens Japanese and German precedence in the Council.

 lec.118.d: "Federalism in China has been defeated many times, yet always seems to rise from the ashes. Chief among the reasons for this is the persistence of its main advocate, Chen Jiongming from Guangdong. He has recently defeated the hostile Guangxi clique, as well as traitors within his own ranks, and is now ready to begin expeditions northward and eastward. To organise his regime and allies, he is holding a conference in Shantou, or Swatow, one of the cities that makes up our Mandate. Since the city formally belongs to China, and his province, we have no legal grounds to deny him. We are unlikely to even be granted observer status, so we can only observe from without how this conference to decide the fate of China goes."

Since he can legally be bailed before his trial begins, there is no reason to even go to the trouble of taking him to the station. Surely, the government would be willing to accept immediate bail payment in cash. The officers quickly agreed, and so Du Yuesheng waits for his trial in the style in which he is accustomed - independently."

They alerted the Legation Council, which in turn dispatched its security forces to search for the triad leader across the Mandate. However, after over a month of looking, it seems that Du is gone, with those that know where he is remaining totally silent to our investigators. In his absence, the triad leadership has fallen onto lesser shoulders, but the leadership of the nationalist Chinese community is now ever more clearly on Robert Hotung, the 'Grand Old Man of Hong Kong'."

As such, just as in 1937, the time has come to decide the Cities' future. The High Commissioner has invoked Article 14, and the Legation Council has gathered to decide the fate of the Mandate. While the Americans, naturally, wish to return to preeminence over the Cities, their country is hardly in a better state than Japan is. The Germans, having retained their empire in the face of much adversity, are also an option, yet the anti-German bent of the council recently might make this difficult. The British urge the Council turn to them, for though they, too, are in exile, they at least have shown their longevity in it. Others in the Cities' bureaucracy have instead attempted to convince High Commissioner Okazaki that the time for foreign control over the Cities is done. Should we grant them their request?

 lec.148.d: "In international news, the new hit French drama from Algeria, 'Le Drame de Shanghai' (The Shanghai Drama), hit the box office. Filmed by the acclaimed G.W. Pabst and starring superstars such as Christl Mardayn, Louis Jouvet, and Raymond Rouleau, the film depicts an exiled French aristocrat (played by Christl Mardayn) working as a cabaret singer in Shanghai to support her daughter’s education. Adapted from a novel by Oscar Paul Gilbert, critics have noticed that the film is a commentary of China's fractious and political state while also highlighting the hedonistic lifestyle of European expatriates and exiles crammed in Shanghai’s international quarters. The main protagonist’s exiled background serves as a reminder of the exiled Britons and Frenchmen in Asia, with their countries fallen to syndicalism. The film also highlights the crime and glory of the Shanghai nightlife featuring a mysterious and conspirational organisation called the Black Dragon, which follows a charismatic and nationalistic leader named Cheng, who is determined to drive out westerners and foreign influence China.\n\nUnlike most films centred on Asian themes, the Shanghai Drama boasts an impressive cast of Asians since much of the filming was done beyond Shanghai's international settlement. Regardless of the film’s political undertones, it is considered a box office success, with critics praising Mardayn’s performance and Pabst's filmography."

 lec.149.d: "In the dim lights of Fuzhou Road in Huangpu district, one of Shanghai’s most red-light districts, a new and peculiar form of cooking has achieved popularity among the residents. These businesses have also opened up in Hong Kong, where they are popular among the residents not allowed to eat at western hotels and restaurants. Opened by the Cantonese who have been used to cooking with western and Chinese ingredients, these restaurants employ Chinese cooks who have whipped up their takes on popular western dishes. These dishes, nicknamed 'dacai', or big dishes are a homey fusion of cheap western dishes catered to Chinese taste. Popular items amongst fans of dacai include borscht without beets, baked lasagna with cheese, and deep-fried pork chops with Worcestershire sauce and beef burgundy. In addition to the western dishes, traditional Chinese food serves as a replacement, such as Chinese wine in the absence of western wine or shark fin soup. Meals are often concluded with a western-style apple pie, vanilla pudding, or coffee. In particular, dacai dishes have found popularity amongst prostitutes who hang out at such eateries, looking stylish and hoping to earn a free meal and some business."

 lec.151.d: "The newest hit at the Shanghai box office is 'Street Angel,' a film directed by Yuan Muzhi and released by the Mingxing Film Company. For weeks leading up to the film’s release, the film has been promoted and pushed to be shown in all theatres by the League of Left-Wing Writers, who have declared this film a 'masterpiece' of the Chinese left-wing movement. The film holds allusions to the national struggles plaguing China, including modernisation issues and the disruption of national unity.\n\nThe film stars the popular Chinese actor Zhao Dan and the iconic singer Zhou Xuan (famous for songs such as Blooming Flowers Full Moon) and is set in the slums of old Shanghai. Xiao Chen (played by Zhao Dan), a trumpet player, falls in love with the singer Xiao Hong (played by Zhou Xuan), an immigrant from the Fengtian Government in Manchuria, and her older sister Xiao Yun. Xiao Yun is forced into prostitution to make a living while Xiao Hong works as a singer at a teahouse. After a misunderstanding that gives the impression that Xiao Hong is unfaithful, Xiao Chen discovers she and her sister are to be sold off to a wealthy gangster named Mr. Gu. The legal fees to stop the transaction are too much for Xiao Chen, so he and the girls attempt to flee Gu’s grasp. While Xiao Hong manages to escape, Xiao Yun is caught by Gu but refuses to reveal her sister’s whereabouts. In a violent confrontation with Gu, she is fatally wounded, but by the time her friends and sister return, they can do nothing; they are simply too poor to afford a doctor.\n\nThe film’s telling and powerful depiction of social disparity is an open critique of the corruption and poverty caused by Shanghai’s colonialist state. In addition, the use of Chinese songs in the film help emphasise Chinese national characteristics, distinguishing Chinese culture from that of the West."

 lec.152.d: "Today, all of China experienced a great sense of loss as the beautiful and exceptional actress of Ruan Lingyu (also known as Lily Yuen) has passed away at the age of 28 due to suicide. Well known all throughout China due to the box office successes from Shanghai and her silent acting ability, word has it that over 100,000 people will be attending her funeral in Shanghai.\n\nBorn to a working-class family in Shanghai without much of a father figure, Ruan spent her early life working as a housemaid with her mother. In 1926, to help make ends meet, she signed up for the prominent Mingxing Film Company and made her first film at 16. However, her first real break came in Spring Dream of an Old Capital in 1930, which was a massive hit throughout China. She continued to play leading roles in other popular hits such as Love and Duty (1931), Little Toys (1933), and The Goddess (1934). However, with the arrival of actual “talkies” in China (films featuring voice instead of silent acting), her popularity began to erode. Her tumultuous private life was exploited heavily by tabloids and gossip, and her divorce from her husband became one of vindictive coverage. At the age of 28, she has committed suicide with an overdose of barbiturates - her suicide note only declaring that “a gossip is a fearful event.” Needless to say, her death has significantly impacted the people of China, who were enamoured with her skilful acting and charisma. A report from her funeral procession declares that three women grieving also took their lives."

 lec.153.t: "Eileen Chang"
 lec.153.d: "A new bestseller has emerged in Shanghai, “The Golden Cangue,” a telling story regarding life in the Legation Cities, one full of strife, crime, and imperialism. A harsh critique of life in Hong Kong, the book portrays the wealth disparity between the local Chinese and the wealthy westerners.\n\nThe author is the 23-year-old Zhang Ying, a Chinese woman of aristocratic lineage and educated bilingually. Born in Shanghai in 1920, Ying, better known as Eileen Chang, lived a life of comfort. However, arguments and bickering were frequent in the Ying household due to her father’s opium addiction and extramarital affairs. After her mother returned from France to study, Chang was exposed to the literary works of the French writer “George Sand” (Amantine Dupin), the famous French feminist who had a profound impact on Chang. In 1939, Chang was accepted to the University of London in the Union of Britain for an academic scholarship. Still, due to the war in Europe, she decided to study in Hong Kong instead. And thus, in a time of uncertainty, disorder, and war in China, Chang moves between Shanghai and Hong Kong.\n\nMuch of her writing has to do with life in the Legation Cities. Her first book, “Love in a Sinful City,” is set in her contemporary Hong Kong and Shanghai and deals with life in the Legation Cities in a period of uncertainty. As the war rages on in Europe, resources are becoming increasingly scarce in the Legation Cities, and tensions are emerging regarding the unequal relationship between the wealthy westerners and the local population. According to critics, her writing has illustrated what life was for the ordinary Chinese people and how life persisted despite the severe inequalities and the stress of being at war. Her latest book, “The Golden Cangue,” features stirring metaphors such as the moon, familial hierarchy, cangues, and footbinding to illustrate the decadence of the idle rich in Shanghai. Given her young age, critics have also remarked that her literary maturity seems beyond her. Her works written in the Chinese vernacular have also been translated into English, attracting her fans in the English-speaking world."

 lec.154.d: "The story of Mulan is an ancient Chinese ballad about a young woman who goes into battle dressed as a male. It is also one the subject of one of Nationalist China’s latest blockbusters “Mulan Joins the Army.”\n\nSet in the Northern Wei Dynasty, Mulan is a mischievous young girl who is skilled in the martial arts and archery. However, her father is conscripted into war and Mulan goes in his stead; dressed as a male. She meets a fellow conscript named Yuandu Liu and for the next three years, she and Yuandu protect the border from barbarians. Despite having intelligence that the barbarians are planning a secret assault, Mulan’s commander refuses to believe her and Yuandu. They manage to get approval to launch a reconnaissance mission where they discover an attack is indeed imminent but the commander who has been bribed by barbarians, refuses to believe her. Frustrated, Mulan leads an attack to recapture their city after it is being attacked by the barbarians and the commander is executed. Mulan turns down an offer to serve in the imperial court and instead goes home, reverting back to her feminine persona. She marries Yuandu and the two live happily ever after.\n\nWritten and produced despite the censorship laws of the Japanese, the film is full of subtle patriotic themes and has become extremely popular among the local Chinese. The character of Mulan has been compared to the leader Song Qingling and its talks of fighting against barbarians has resonated deeply within the local Chinese."

 lec.155.d: "The Open Door policy that kept peace and order between the ambitious western nations and Japan in China has finally ended. With tensions in the world rising due to the events in Europe and Asia, the inevitability of conflict arriving on the Asian continent has led the Legation Cities to join the [LEC.GetFactionName] faction in a great break from the traditional non-alignment of the cities. This places the treaty ports firmly in the [LEC.GetFactionName] sphere of influence, the Legation Mandate has ended with the nations of the international alliances withdrawing their troops and ambassadors from the Legation Cities. Businesses scramble as this effectively places the treat ports under the economic sphere of the [LEC.GetFactionName]. While this marks an end of an era, this may also lead to unforeseen consequences as now all bets are off, and the Legation Cities are open to foreign aggression or perhaps even demands from the Chinese."

At the head of this alliance is crime lord Du Yuesheng, better known as \"Big Ears Du\".\n\nYuesheng's iron grip on the opium trade out of Shanghai is long established, and with the establishment of the Legation Cities the route has been opened for him and the Green Gang to muscle in on Hong Kong. The triad gangsters who thrive in the Chinese districts of Hong Kong have pushed back strongly against this attempt, culminating in a clash today between them and Green Gang men at a pleasure house in Hong Kong. Reportedly at least fifty people were involved in an armed clash with machetes, knives and pistols before the police were able to break it up. This has only served to highlight the ongoing problem of criminality in the cities and its potentially destabilising effect."

Our files tell us the following:\n\nDu Yuesheng was born in a poor Chinese village in what is now the neutral zone in 1888, at the age of just four his mother had died in childbirth, his father was dead and his sister sold into slavery. He returned to his village to live with his grandmother. Returning to Shanghai at the age of fourteen he worked at a fruit stall until he was fired for theft, whereupon a job as a bouncer at a brothel brought him into contact with the Green Gang. From there he was introduced to Huang Jinrong, the highest ranked Chinese detective in the former French, now German, concession of Shanghai. Jinrong's wife saw potential in the boy and had him assist on a number of large opium deals, gradually expanding his remit and network of contacts, as well as his wealth.\n\nIn 1924 when Lu Yongxiang, then in control of most of Shanghai, had Huang Jinrong locked up for publicly beating his son Du found himself filling his shoes and in control of most of the German Concession's criminal enterprises. While Jinrong was released thanks in part to the Green Gang's close relationship with Zhejiang warlord Du would forever more be the most prominent Shanghai gangster.\n\nDu is colloquially known as \"Big Ears Du\" for obvious reasons and has an outgoing and gregarious personality, generous to friends but ruthless to foes. The leader of several legitimate businesses, a few of which aren't fronts for illegal dealings, Du is also the head of the Association of Chinese Tax Payers, sits on the board of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and is the sponsor of at least one major temple in Shanghai."

Retained and promoted due to his skills as a sleuth, a lack of competent administrators eventually lead the Germans to appoint him Chief of Police in their new concession after the French were removed. Adapting smoothly to his new role the only hiccup came when he was imprisoned illegally for beating Lu Yongxiang's son, which saw Du Yuesheng rise to prominence as the foremost member of the Green Gang in the concession and placed Huang in his debt.\n\nJinrong is for his part a patient man, seemingly preferring to let the younger Du run the show while he enjoys the vast wealth being his loyal second-in-command brings him. His ex-wife Lin Guisheng was said to be the true brains and ambition behind many of his operations, however in the aftermath of the formation of the International Mandate Jinrong expertly saw that the Green Gang in the German Concession became the dominant group in all of Shanghai, so there must be more to him than just a vast address book."

Born in Zhejiang province right on the outskirts of Shanghai and a graduate of the province's military academy, Xiaolin came to Shanghai in 1912 already well-connected with the provincial warlords that surrounded the city. From there he put those connections to use, working then under Huang Jinrong. With the help of the warlord armies the gang secured control over the trade routes running down the Yangtze River and gained a stranglehold on the city's opium trade.\n\nWhile he might be key to their prominence, Zhang Xiaolin was passed over by Huang Jinrong and Lin Guisheng for the honour of taking over the most prominent role as head of the Green Gang, a fact Zhang has always resented. As a result of his resentment a growing rift is noted between him and Du Yuesheng, who further distrusts Zhang for his violent nature and the lurid tales about how he treats those who cross him. It may only be a matter of time before the split becomes official, and either Xiaolin or Yuesheng has to go..."

 lecshorting.1.d: "In the aftermath of Black Monday everybody seems to be licking their financial wounds, everybody, that is, except a group of businessmen, mostly Americans, who took a short position on German government bonds just days before the crash. They have, to use a colloquialism, made out like bandits from the deal. The Ostchina Direktorium has begun to raise a stink about the whole affair after it emerged that the major loser in the short sale was the state-backed Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, the commercial bank of choice for German businessmen, and demanded that there be an investigation into allegations of insider trading!"
 lecshorting.1.a: "Just because we Americans have common sense..."
 lecshorting.2.t: "DAB 구제?"
 lecshorting.2.d: "The most pressing issue for the Shanghai business community right now is the tottering Deutsch-Asiatische Bank and its potential collapse. If the Legation Council approves, an... undisclosed amount of funds could be released for the benefit of the DAB to prevent a run on the bank and reassure savers."
 lecshorting.2.a: "Convene a session, let's put it to a vote!"
 lecshorting.2.b: "Let it float, what's the worst that can happen?"
 lecshorting.3.t: "공사관이사회: 구제금융?"
 lecshorting.3.d: "Black Monday has left deep scars in the global economy, and particularly on the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in Shanghai, which seems to have fallen victim to unscrupulous business practices and possibly insider trading. Our delegation are now seeking guidance on how they should vote concerning the proposed bailout of the DAB."
 lecshorting.3.a: "We will consider our options carefully."
 lecshorting.4.t: "공사관이사회의 투표 결과"
 lecshorting.4.d: "The privations of the DAB have been made clear to the Legation Council and as a result the bailout has been..."
 lecshorting.4.a: "가결되었습니다!"
 lecshorting.4.b: "부결되었습니다!"
 lecshorting.5.t: "독일령 동아시아의 붕괴!"
 lecshorting.5.d: "Early this morning a run on Deutsch-Asiatische Bank signalled a death knell for the institution, which was overleveraged with now worthless German government bonds. As a result its operations are now undergoing a semi-orderly collapse and their remaining assets are being auctioned off, which has roused fury from the influential Germans in the Legation Cities over the council's lack of action. It looks like nobody is going to be getting back their money any time soon..."
 lecshorting.5.a: "어이쿠."
 lecshorting.6.t: "독일령 동아시아의 상황 안정화!"
 lecshorting.6.d: "It seems that German's financial lynchpin in the east will remain stable for now, enough security has been found to ensure their future and protect their assets, which has mollified German concerns over insider trading somewhat."
 lecshorting.6.a: "참 다행이야."
 lecshorting.7.t: "German Fury - Heads Must Roll!"
 lecshorting.7.d: "Following the collapse of their prize bank in the East, the Germans have furiously telegrammed the Legation Council and had their delegation make one thing clear: somebody had better get arrested or deported for this, or else!"
 lecshorting.7.a: "Have the Japanese oversee the investigation!"
 lecshorting.7.b: "Have the British oversee the investigation!"
 lecshorting.7.c: "Have the respected chief of police, Huang Jinrong, do it!"
 lecshorting.8.t: "German Anger - Somebody's Behind This!"
 lecshorting.8.d: "The Germans, despite being pleased about the rallying of the DAB after Black Monday, are applying considerable pressure for there to be an investigation into what exactly went on with regard to the allegations of insider trading. This is a very serious accusation, and if it emerges that somebody tipped the American businessmen in question off about German monetary policy then they may even need to be extradited..."
 lecshorting.8.a: "Entrust the Japanese with the investigation."
 lecshorting.8.b: "Have the financial experts, the British, investigate."
 lecshorting.8.c: "Let Huang Jinrong take the reins!"
 lecshorting.9.t: "The Japanese Investigate - Efficiently"
 lecshorting.9.d: "The China Special Agency has been called in by the Japanese to investigate the current insider trading scandal. Their first action was to launch a surprise raid on the headquarters of the DAB and round up several important Germans for questioning, followed by picking up some Americans who had been involved in the matter. While the Germans are frustrated at the gung-ho, and some say discriminatory, actions of the Japanese others have lauded them for their efforts. While they have been unable to find evidence of insider trading they have supplied valuable information divulged under pressure about the activities of one American notable in the cities..."
 lecshorting.9.a: "One has to wonder - what did they ask?"
 lecshorting.10.t: "The British Investigate - Thoroughly"
 lecshorting.10.d: "The British have been assigned to the DAB case and after a month of inquiries have returned their report: absolutely no evidence of wrongdoing by the Americans can be found. It would seem they are simply very shrewd businessmen."
 lecshorting.10.a: "Are you sure?"
 lecshorting.11.t: "Huang Jinrong Is On The Case!"
 lecshorting.11.d: "It would seem that Huang Jinrong has been able to pull off the impossible, within days he had made an arrest among the German business community, embarrassing them thoroughly, and uncovered information passed to several American businessmen. Multiple traders have thus been barred for life from any respectable stock exchange and the implication of Germans has cast doubt across their strict, law abiding image."
 lecshorting.11.a: "Huzzah!"
 lecshorting.12.t: "HSBC Buys Deutsch-Asiatische Stock"
 lecshorting.12.d: "In a surprising move today the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation purchased a large stake in Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, a bullish move despite the current economic downturn. How exactly they managed to secure the sale so quickly remains to be seen, but some are convinced that it is linked with the Hong-Kong Police Department's recent probe into the trading scandal."
 lecshorting.12.a: "Strange move."
 lecshorting.13.t: "일본의 조사"
 lecshorting.13.d: "The Japanese investigation has been uncharacteristically demure, possibly due to a lack of German pressure denying them the right to conduct certain raids or detain individuals for excessive lengths of time. Either way they've uncovered some interesting information, particularly regarding one Lothar Eisenträger..."
 lecshorting.13.a: "Oh my."
 lecshorting.14.t: "Huang Jinrong Is On The Case!"
 lecshorting.14.d: "Within a few days of starting his investigation Huang Jinrong has made an arrest, an American businessman is now in custody and the papers of the DAB are being looked over. There is apparently no evidence of any wrongdoing by anybody else. By the way have you met Mr. Jinrong's new wife? She wears the finest jewellery."
 lecshorting.14.a: "There's something fishy here..."
 lecshorting.15.t: "The British Enquiry"
 lecshorting.15.d: "After a few weeks of investigation by officials from Hong Kong it would seem no wrongdoing can be found. Alas, these are troubled times, but at least the council has been shown to be an effective force in keeping the city clean."
 lecshorting.15.a: "어쩔 수 없지."
 lecbrits.1.t: "British Concern Over Shanghai-Centrism"
 lecbrits.1.d: "A consortium of British businessmen has submitted a formal statement today in response to our planned tram construction in Shanghai, asking that investment in Shanghai and Hong Kong be equalised. While this is obviously too bold of a demand they probably intend, if engaged in discussion, to dial down to simply requesting that some sort of increased investment in Hong Kong be pushed forward. It is likely that if we do not agree to help them here, they will reach out to the British Crown, which may attempt to take an active role in the politics of the Cities. However, if we give them what they want, it is anticipated that we shall hear little further from them."
 lecbrits.1.a: "Put up some funding to invest in Hong Kong."
 lecbrits.1.b: "Ignore their demands, they can't do anything."
 lecbrits.1.c: "Cancel the new tram project, we must equalise funding."
 lecbrits.2.t: "Outcry From the Japanese"
 lecbrits.2.d: "The Japanese are outraged that we would fold to pressure groups like this, and are launching accusations from all quarters. Their newspapers print stories on the injustices afflicted on them by the American puppets on the council siphoning off money into their own pockets, and there may be more far-reaching consequences."
 lecbrits.2.a: "A storm in a teacup."
 lecbrits.3.t: "Germans Accuse the Council of Favouritism"
 lecbrits.3.d: "The German interest groups in the Legation Cities have expressed consternation at what they feel is favouritism displayed towards Hong Kong and British interests in general, with the Tsingtau Latest News publishing multiple scathing polemics about the corruption inherent in the council. It's clear they want the funding for new projects outside of Shanghai and Tianjin pulled, in order to demonstrate even-handedness."
 lecbrits.3.a: "We don't care about them."
 lecbrits.3.b: "Fine, pull the funding!"
 lecbrits.4.t: "British Outraged"
 lecbrits.4.d: "The British are outraged and the Hong Kong press has once again bemoaned the unfairness of the arrangements foisted upon them after the revolution at home. Shanghai is being favoured above the other cities they claim, and talk of the siphoning off of resources and the end of Hong Kong's special status has the business community nervous."
 lecbrits.4.a: "Sacrifices must be made."
 lecbrits.5.t: "Americans Speak for Hong Kong Investment"
 lecbrits.5.d: "Major American businessmen have been in touch with the council today, expressing what they feel are legitimate concerns about the openness of the cities and the need to invest in all quarters to ensure equal access to China. They want us to fund the infrastructure spending in Hong Kong and have warned that the flow of American capital can't be guaranteed if we don't."
 lecbrits.5.a: "They're welcome to try!"
 lecbrits.5.b: "If that's really what's best for finance..."
 lecbrits.6.t: "Chinese Are Up in Arms"
 lecbrits.6.d: "Chinese citizen groups today lodged a formal protest with the Shanghai Municipal Council and key Legation organs, declaring that they will not accept the cancellation of the tram projects in Shanghai as anything less than colonial neglect and oppression, and hundreds have signed a petition calling for a Chinese member to be added to the Legation Council to ensure balance and representation of the majority."
 lecbrits.6.a: "Now that's just ridiculous."
 lecbrits.7.t: "Syndicalist Protests?"
 lecbrits.7.d: "A bombing of a police station today underscored just how tense the situation in Shanghai can grow very quickly. With protestors and insurgents evading us through use of the neutral zone they have managed to wage a sustained campaign of disobedience, seemingly always informed of the police's next move."
 lecbrits.7.a: "Try to find out who keeps informing them."
 lecbrits.8.t: "Assassination Of an Official"
 lecbrits.8.d: "A major civil servant and member of the Legation Volunteer Force was murdered in cold blood today, apparently in a planned political assassination! A manhunt is under way for the killers."
 lecbrits.8.a: "Best to lock the windows..."
 lecbrits.9.t: "[QIE.GetName] Objects"
 lecbrits.9.d: "The [QIE.GetAdjective] government has issued an official statement today regarding recent issues in the Legation Cities. It claims that if we are to be responsible for the cities we must be responsible to the Chinese people, and states that [QIE.GetLeader] is beginning to wonder if the current authorities are truly doing their duty. Without saying it too openly, he has effectively questioned the mandate of the Legation Council."
 lecbrits.9.a: "Tell [QIE.GetLeader] he's welcome to our Chinese dissidents."
 lecbrits.10.t: "홍콩의 불안"
 lecbrits.10.d: "It seems that discontent against the Legation Cities has soared in Hong Kong, as prominent Hongkonger businessmen's pleas for funding were rejected by the Legation Council. Many in the city are speaking with nostalgia of the days Hong Kong belonged to the British Crown. We should exploit this opportunity before it passes."
 lecbrits.10.a: "And quickly!"
 lecbrits.10.b: "We don't need these slippery businessmen!"
 lecbrits.10.c: "I'm sure our friends in Canberra can help them."
 lecbrits.11.t: "British Activity in Hong Kong"
 lecbrits.11.d: "Following their defeat in the recent debate over funding in Hong Kong, British businessmen have reached out to the nations of the former British Empire. It seems that the King-Emperor has eagerly agreed to help them, and even now the Hongkongers are making dangerous moves against us."
 lecbrits.11.a: "We should stay informed."
 lecbrits.12.t: "Hong Kong Unrest Smoothed Over"
 lecbrits.12.d: "It seems that burgeoning unrest in Hong Kong against the perceived Shanghai-centrism of the Legation Council has been suppressed by Shanghai. They have promised to prioritise equal funding between Hong Kong and Shanghai, and have even gone so far as to cancel the railroad in Shanghai that started the trouble. The entire incident has probably served to eliminate any opportunity for renewed influence we might have exerted over Hong Kong."
 lecbrits.12.a: "Damn and blast!"
 lecbrits.13.t: "Appointing a New Hong Kong Governor"
 lecbrits.13.d: "Though Hong Kong has been out of our grasp since 1925 when we asked for German protection for our concessions, we have always held the territory legally. Even when it became administered by the Legation Council, we kept theoretical ownership of the whole city as one concession among many.\n\nOne thing that has always stayed constant is our right to appoint a governor in Hong Kong, but we have not done so in over a decade. The current Acting Administrator of Hong Kong is Norman Lockhart Smith, but though he is undoubtedly loyal to the Crown, he does have local connections that would possibly lead him to act more independently than we could prefer. We could easily earmark him as our candidate for High Commissioner of the Legation Cities, and thus find a way to make him accept his removal and replacement by Mark Aitchison Young, a more loyal civil servant currently stationed in the West Indies Federation. Alternatively, we could appoint Young to be our future voice in Shanghai, and keep Smith in his current position. Who should we choose?"
 lecbrits.13.a: "Smith has served us well in Hong Kong."
 lecbrits.13.b: "Smith would serve us better in Shanghai."
 lecbrits.14.t: "Canada Appoints a New Consul in Shanghai"
 lecbrits.14.d: "It would seem the British continue to extend their influence. They have contacted the Governor of Hong Kong, Norman Lockhart Smith, and have also appointed a new Consul in Shanghai, Mark Aitchison Young. He is now responsible for all British Concessions in China beyond Hong Kong, and it is anticipated the Canadians may soon begin to take more extreme actions to renew their influence. Norman Lockhart Smith is a man of the status quo, however, and he would lose much if it were to change. We could possibly stop the British plots in their tracks if we leant on him in some way."
 lecbrits.14.a: "This is nothing worthy of comment."
 lecbrits.14.b: "We should investigate Hong Kong and lean on Administrator Smith."
 lecbrits.15.t: "The British Appoint a New Governor for Hong Kong"
 lecbrits.15.d: "The British have appointed Mark Aitchison Young as the new governor of Hong Kong, and have switched the former governor of Hong Kong, Norman Lockhart Smith, to be their ambassador in Shanghai, a position that was previously empty since the British withdrawal in 1926."
 lecbrits.15.a: "Worrying moves."
 lecbrits.16.t: "Investigating the British in Hong Kong"
 lecbrits.16.d: "The British presence in the Cities has been growing for some months now, and their appointment of a new ambassador to Shanghai is worrying many Legation Council members, who fear that the British may soon attempt to re-assert themselves on the Council, or far more worryingly restore British rule to Hong Kong. Should we send someone to investigate Acting Administrator Smith's ties to the Crown?"
 lecbrits.16.a: "Ask Du Yuesheng for help."
 lecbrits.16.b: "Huang Jinrong is a capable man!"
 lecbrits.16.c: "The Japanese can be trusted."
 lecbrits.17.t: "Du Yuesheng's Results"
 lecbrits.17.d: "Du Yuesheng's men have broken into some houses and conducted some interrogations, and the Triad seems confident he is on the way to finding out what the British are up to in Hong Kong. He currently believes that the Hongkongers might be trying to return to the fold of the British Empire by inviting Australasian or Canadian troops to occupy the city. He claims his men can get the results they need if they are granted permission to question Governor Smith. Should we let him proceed?"
 lecbrits.17.a: "Go ahead."
 lecbrits.17.b: "It's too dangerous."
 lecbrits.18.t: "Huang Jinrong's Conclusions"
 lecbrits.18.d: "Huang Jinrong appears to have hired several prominent Hongkonger businessmen to investigate the British Crown's activities in Hong Kong. He now has presented evidence to the High Commissioner that seems to implicate prominent Japanese businessmen in a plot to get Britain back onto the Legation Council. This might seem highly suspect, but Huang Jinrong just invited you on a trip down-town, and you wouldn't want to ruin the mood..."
 lecbrits.18.a: "This man is a genius!"
 lecbrits.18.b: "This is obviously a lie."
 lecbrits.19.t: "The Japanese Commission Wraps Up"
 lecbrits.19.d: "The Japanese have found interesting pieces of evidence, many of which point to the British Crown attempting to regain their voting rights on the Legation Council. Our investigators have posited that a meeting with Governor Smith of Hong Kong could help them identify the full details of the plot. Should we allow the Japanese to proceed?"
 lecbrits.19.a: "Send the Japanese in to deal with Smith."
 lecbrits.19.b: "They're just helping themselves."
 lecbrits.20.t: "The Confrontation With Governor Smith"
 lecbrits.20.d: "Our agents have emerged from Governor Smith's house with startling news: the British are trying to both take back Hong Kong for the Crown and reclaim their voting rights on the Legation Council. These would drastically change the status quo of the Legation Cities and Hong Kong, radical changes that Governor Smith would prefer to avoid. He has assured our investigators and the Commissioner that he would be willing to obfuscate British plans to reconquer Hong Kong, if necessary, though he expects a healthy stipend in return."
 lecbrits.20.a: "Thank you for your time, sir."
 lecbrits.25.t: "Australasia Democratises"
 lecbrits.25.d: "The Australasian Confederation has been ruled by the authoritarian hand of Governor-General Birdwood for twelve years. Now, however, it seems that the Crown has granted leave for new elections to be held. It is unlikely that radicals, even if elected, will be allowed to remain long, and so this news has bought the British some support in the Cities."
 lecbrits.25.a: "Stability is good for business."
 lecbrits.26.t: "Australasia Falls to Radicals"
 lecbrits.26.d: "Canberra has been organising the British in our territory with a view of retaking Hong Kong or reclaiming the British voting rights. Now that Australasia is no longer in a position to protect them, having fallen to radicalism, this has dissuaded some from their efforts to regain the Crown's protection."
 lecbrits.26.a: "This should slow their progress."
 lecbrits.27.t: "A Royal Visit to Hong Kong"
 lecbrits.27.d: "Today the HMS Sussex arrived in Hong Kong from Halifax with royal passengers - Prince Albert of Windsor and his young daughter, Princess Elizabeth. High Commissioner [LEC.GetLeader] and several other ambassadors and representatives to the Legation Council stood at the end of the dock to meet him. After some brief formalities, the Prince and his entourage got in a taxicab and drove quickly to the Peninsula Hong Kong hotel, citing his daughter's seasickness as the reason for the hasty departure. It is anticipated that he will have several meetings with important British officials and businessmen in Hong Kong throughout the month-long stay, as well as some tours about the city and its outskirts. Given the Prince's dislike for large public gatherings, however, it is unlikely that he will advertise these outings much."
 lecbrits.27.a: "Welcome to the Legation Cities, Your Royal Highness."
 lecbrits.28.t: "Our Place on the Legation Council"
 lecbrits.28.d: "Our membership in the Legation Council, on behalf of Hong Kong, has now been passed on."
 lecbrits.28.d.govt: "Following our regime change, many of the British subjects in Asia have lost faith that we are able or willing to protect them."
 lecbrits.28.a: "So be it"
 lecbrits.29.t: "Hong Kong and the Legation Council"
 lecbrits.29.d: "Hong Kong is a British part of [LEC.GetNameDef], and thus it now falls to us to be the caretaker of the colony and its membership in the council."
 lecbrits.29.a: "We will do what we can"
 lecbrits.30.t: "British Volunteers Arrive"
 lecbrits.30.d: "Today, a thousand volunteers from across the British Empire in Asia arrived in Hong Kong to sign up for the defence force. Many of them were officers in Australasia, India, and Malaya, so they received officer commissions for the defence force as well. Unfortunately, both their presence within the defence force and the ceremony that accompanied the new recruits has lead to an up-tick in British patriotism and allegiance in Hong Kong."
 lecbrits.30.a: "We can always use more men, I suppose."
 lecbrits.31.t: "Bringing Hong Kong Back Into the Empire"
 lecbrits.31.d: "Now that we are able to make our move, and the Legation Cities are in turmoil, it would be possible to move back into Hong Kong, and reclaim the city for the Empire. Some argue, however, that this move would alienate us internationally, as many nations do not recognise the presence of a responsible British government. Should we send the fleet?"
 lecbrits.31.a: "Hong Kong shall be returned to the fold!"
 lecbrits.31.b: "This would isolate us internationally."
 lecbrits.32.t: "The British Deploy Troops in Hong Kong!"
 lecbrits.32.d: "The British have appeared to have mustered everything they could in the Legation Cities for an operation to reoccupy Hong Kong. Earlier today, a flotilla from the Royal Navy entered Victoria Harbour demanding that the governor of Hong Kong meet with the British at the Peninsula Hotel to discuss the “restoration of order” and immediate return of the former Crown Colony. No troops have disembarked from their ships, stopping this from becoming a full invasion. Still, it would appear that the situation is quite dire. We can, however, refuse their negotiations and ask the governor to hold out for a bit longer until we can bring reinforcements. "
 lecbrits.32.a: "Withdraw the Volunteer Force, at least."
 lecbrits.32.b: "Let's hope our investigations and pressure have paid off..."
 lecbrits.32.c: "There will be war!"
 lecbrits.33.t: "Hong Kong Reclaimed!"
 lecbrits.33.d.peace: "After fifteen years we have finally reclaimed the Jewel of the East! Today our troops arrived in Tsim Sha Tsui and were met by the Governor who promised to acquiesce to our returned rule. Another small part of the world is painted red once more!"
 lecbrits.33.d.war: "After fifteen years we have finally reclaimed the Jewel of the East! Today our troops disembarked in Tsim Sha Tsui and were met by the Governor who promised to acquiesce to our returned rule. Unfortunately, the Legation Cities have voted to reclaim this crucial port and have attacked us. We can, however, still celebrate the fact that another small part of the world is painted red once more!"
 lecbrits.33.a: "God Save the King!"
 lecbrits.34.t: "Hong Kong Unrest Ends"
 lecbrits.34.d: "While there has been some unrest in Hong Kong for the past couple of months, the Hong Kong Police Force and garrison in the city have reported that the people have now come to accept the rule of the returned Empire. Some are even signing up for the Royal Navy!"
 lecbrits.34.a: "Clearly they are men of sense in Hong Kong."
 lecbrits.35.t: "Smith Succeeds"
 lecbrits.35.d: "Governor Smith has successfully defused the British loyalists in his administration, and they have informed the British administrators sent to occupy the city that they do not require their services. Our deal with Governor Smith has paid in dividends."
 lecbrits.35.a: "Good man."
 lecbrits.36.t: "Smith Betrays Us!"
 lecbrits.36.d: "It seems that Governor Smith took our money and broke his promises! He has accepted the return of the British Crown with open arms, and with our forces in disarray we can do nothing."
 lecbrits.36.a: "Bastard."
 lecbrits.37.t: "Governor Smith Betrays Us"
 lecbrits.37.d: "When our troops arrived in Hong Kong, they were greeted by Governor Smith, who privately informed our officials that he would by no means condone a British return. It is rumoured that the High Commissioner has bought his loyalty."
 lecbrits.37.a: "Call off the occupation."
 lecbrits.40.t: "British Voting Rights in the Legation Cities"
 lecbrits.40.d: "When the Legation Council was created in 1928, the British were granted observer rights only, since Germany and Japan refused to recognise the government in Ottawa as a 'responsible British government.' Now that we have amassed a good deal of influence in the Cities, however, we are in a position to convince the Legation Council that our cause is just. We shall persuade the Austrian ambassador, as an uninterested third party, to motion for a restoration of our rights."
 lecbrits.40.a: "Let us ask Shanghai for our rights."
 lecbrits.41.t: "Restoration of the British Voting Rights"
 lecbrits.41.d: "When the Legation Council was created in 1928, the United Kingdom, as the power with the most concessions in China, was naturally given a seat on the council. However, since Germany and Japan refused to recognise Ottawa as a \"responsible British government,\" the British were given only observer rights. Now we have an opportunity to rectify that mistake, and the British lobby has been pressuring us to grant them their rights back. Today the Austrian ambassador, possibly bribed by the British, raised the issue, and the only choice left to us is whether to allow a vote on the subject or grant the request out of hand."
 lecbrits.41.a: "The Council must vote on it."
 lecbrits.41.b: "We will push it through as a procedural matter."
 lecbrits.42.t: "The Legation Council Votes on Restoring Britain's Vote"
 lecbrits.42.d: "When the Legation Council was created in 1928, the United Kingdom naturally was given a seat on the council. However, since Germany and Japan refused to recognise Ottawa as a 'responsible British government,' the British were given only observer rights. Now, however, it seems that British influence in the Cities is sufficient to get the Council to reconsider restoring the British vote. Now the Council votes on the matter..."
 lecbrits.42.a: "We shall vote wisely."
 lecbrits.43.t: "The Legation Council Votes on Restoring Our Vote"
 lecbrits.43.d: "Our government has heard from our ambassador in Shanghai that the Legation Council plans to vote on restoring our voting rights, denied at in 1928 by Germany and Japan on the grounds of a lack of 'responsible British government.' The ambassador states that is probable that we will be granted our rights, notwithstanding earlier Russian attempts ending in defeat."
 lecbrits.43.a: "We hope he is right."
 lecbrits.44.t: "The Results of the Vote on British Voting Rights"
 lecbrits.44.d: "The Legation Council has voted on the question of restoring Britain's voting rights, and it seems that the vote has ended in..."
 lecbrits.44.a: "Success!"
 lecbrits.44.b: "Defeat."
 lecbrits.45.t: "The Legation Cities Unilaterally Restores British Rights"
 lecbrits.45.d: "When the Legation Council was created in 1928, the United Kingdom naturally was given a seat on the council. However, since Germany and Japan refused to recognise Ottawa as a 'responsible British government,' the British were given only observer rights. Now, however, it seems that British influence in the Cities is sufficient to get the Council to reconsider restoring the British vote. The Austrian ambassador, rumoured to have been bribed by the British, today raised the issue, and it was accepted by the High Commissioner without a vote. It seems the British are back on the Council"
 lecbrits.45.a: "And we weren't even consulted?"
 lecbrits.46.t: "The Legation Council Restores Our Voting Rights"
 lecbrits.46.d: "The Legation Cities only came to be because of Britain's inability to maintain her concessions after the collapse of the Empire. When we invited Germany to occupy Hong Kong in 1925, we could hardly have imagined the near total loss of influence we suffered throughout the next decade. We were never even granted any voting rights on the Legation Council, even though our concessions were the most numerous. Now, though, it seems the Legation Council has rectified their mistake. Today, our ambassador in Shanghai was granted voting rights after a tense debate. We have a share in China once again."
 lecbrits.46.a: "Three cheers for the Empire!"
 lecbrits.47.t: "The Legation Council Votes Against Restoring Our Rights"
 lecbrits.47.d: "It seems the Legation Council has rallied against the Austrian ambassador's motion to restore our voting rights. We shall have to wait for a better opportunity, and many recommend abandoning the idea of regaining our voting rights at all, instead focusing on retaking Hong Kong."
 lecbrits.47.a: "Damn them!"
 lecbrits.50.t: "The Legation Cities Ask for Protection"
 lecbrits.50.d: "Though the Legation Cities have a web of international guarantees of their security, obviously these were not enough for them. They have approached the British Crown for protection, and claim they will be strong bulwark of our alliance in East Asia. Many in Parliament, however, claim that this would only expose us to attack by the Japanese."
 lecbrits.50.a: "Welcome to the Entente."
 lecbrits.50.b: "It would be too risky."
 lecbrits.51.t: "[ENT.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 lecbrits.51.d: "The British Crown has accepted our proposal for an alliance, and are currently dispatching officers and part of the Royal Navy to our aid."
 lecbrits.51.a: "훌륭해!"
 lecbrits.52.t: "[ENT.GetNameDefCap]의 거부!"
 lecbrits.52.d: "The British have refused to allow closer ties between us and their Empire. We shall have to continue to rely on the shaky international guarantees that we have always had."
 lecbrits.52.a: "안타깝군."
 lecbrits.53.t: "홍콩의 영국군"
 lecbrits.53.d: "As our war with the International Mandate for the Chinese Concessions rages on, the [FROM.GetAdjective]s have seen an opportunity to retake their former colony of Hong Kong. The Royal Navy's marines have now occupied Wan Chai and North Point on Hong Kong island and are now poised to take Kowloon.

 lecjapfeud.1.t: "Gang Skirmish in Tianjin"
 lecjapfeud.1.d: "For the most part, the buzzing streets of Tianjin have been spared from the turmoil that has afflicted the rest of China. While anything but calm, this Paris of the Orient has been more accustomed to fireworks than the battles-scarred cities to the west. Today however, the citizens of the city had their daily affairs interrupted as they were treated to a taste of the region's conflicts right at their doorstep.\n\nIt quickly became evident that this was no ordinary heist or criminal dispute as shots were exchanged in a busy street crossing near the diplomatic quarters. Four groups of men in suits, numbering about a dozen total, were exchanging fire before taking off. They managed to escape by mixing in with the panicked crowds, successfully using the general chaos of the situation to evade law enforcement. Two of the criminals were left dead on the ground, and with nothing to tie anyone to a motive or an organisation for the time being the police are left struggling to solve this one. Although an embarrassment for the Tianjin police department, the chief of police has ordered an increase in police presence in the area to root out the gangsters. At the very least, we should be thankful that no innocent people were injured in the crossfire."
 lecjapfeud.1.a: "Catch those crooks!"
 lecjapfeud.2.t: "Escalation of Sectional Disputes"
 lecjapfeud.2.d: "Mere days after the last skirmish, Tianjin was rocked again by another gun battle, this time within the diplomatic quarters itself. Luckily, the increased police presence prevented a repeat of the last public shooting. Their findings in its aftermath are, however, quite alarming.\n\nOnce more, the criminals had gathered in a similar fashion. Only this time, the Tianjin Police Department were able to both observe them before the crime and intervene as things went south. Two gangsters met one-another outside of a cafe and spoke to one another, exchanged a briefcase, and were then assaulted by a group of six men armed with revolvers, seemingly vying for whatever was in the suitcase. What followed almost seemed like it would be more befitting of a crime flick than real life as the stick-up was met by half four armed crooks on either side of them opening fire at the presumptive thieves as they realised all too late that their victims weren't alone. Even worse for all of them, the police were quick to intervene before any further tragedies could be had, and luckily enough all men gave up the moment they realised that they couldn't fight their way past half of Tianjin's police force. While most were tight-lipped about it, the contents of the briefcase gave away that the men are hired guns from local Triads acting as middlemen in a larger dispute, although the contents of the briefcase didn't give away who or what right away. After the suspects were subjected to lengthy interrogations, however, one eventually snapped and ratted them all out. They were acting on behalf of the Japanese embassy, but it gets more convoluted from there on. One group were acting on behalf of the navy attaché, another group from the colonial office, and yet another acting for the Japanese foreign affairs department. We suspect that more departments of the Japanese may be involved as well, but we have no concrete proof at the time being.\n\nThe fact the Japanese have factional disputes is not news to us, but it hasn't gotten this bad in public before. Now comes the difficult choice in deciding how to deal with this situation. We could intervene directly into the matter, although we should be mindful that doing so could open a bigger can of worms than simply letting this factional dispute die down on its own would."
 lecjapfeud.2.a: "개입하라!"
 lecjapfeud.2.b: "Let it simmer down."
 lecjapfeud.3.t: "개입 방법"
 lecjapfeud.3.d: "While it's clear that we have to act, it's less clear as to how we should make our move. Various officers in the police force have come forward, but they all seem to fall on two sides of the same debate. There are the ones that want an official intervention through public channels, and another group that insists that keeping things out of the public eye is essential. During the discussions, both sides made salient points. The prior put an emphasis on adherence to rules and that matters of this importance should be handled professionally and that not doing so would be tantamount to 'stooping to their level'. The other side countered by leaning in on practicality and the better chance of success if things are handled with discretion, noting that the Japanese factions involved are likely to merely dig in their heels if publicly pressured.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the decision was made to..."
 lecjapfeud.3.a: "공식적인 중재를 시도하자."
 lecjapfeud.3.b: "Handle this behind the scenes."
 lecjapfeud.4.t: "Our Investigation Is Ignored by Japan"
 lecjapfeud.4.d: "In a rather disappointing and embarrassing turn of events, our efforts to publicly intervene through official channels has been utterly stonewalled by the Japanese who outright refused to cooperate on the matter. The results so far have merely been strained relations and tensions between the camps, someone no one is happy with. After several weeks of trying, it's likely that continuing with this approach won't yield any different results either.\n\nAfter this fiasco, most seem ready to cut their losses and drop the issue, albeit reluctantly. A small but vocal contingent insists, however, that if they're insistent on hiding their activities then there most be a good reason for it, urging that we investigate them in secret."
 lecjapfeud.4.a: "Drop the issue."
 lecjapfeud.4.b: "Secretly investigate them."
 lecjapfeud.5.t: "Hiring an Investigator"
 lecjapfeud.5.d: "Since we've chosen to investigate the matter, we must decide who we should hire to do the job. Needless to say, we ought to consider our choices carefully as we can't afford another blunder. Our first option is to hire Huang Jinrong, a Chinese detective with underground ties that has worked with the council in the past. Our past working relation coupled with him not harbouring any political biases for or against the Japanese makes him an obvious choice to some. His ties to the underground can, however, be seen as a double-edged sword if we're unlucky.\n\nIn the light of these concerns, some say that it would be more prudent to go for someone with a cleaner record. They have suggested the expertise of both American and German investigation bureau's operating in the region. While they have outstanding track records and are likely to thoroughly and professionally investigate the matter, their expertise lies more in white collar crime and may therefore be less suited for dealing with the Triads. There is also the matter of potential political biases, which we also need to consider. We only have one shot at getting to the bottom of this, so we have to make this investigation count."
 lecjapfeud.5.a: "Huang Jinrong will get to the bottom of this!"
 lecjapfeud.5.b: "Hire the best American gumshoe in Shanghai!"
 lecjapfeud.5.c: "The Germans are, if nothing else, thorough. Hire them!"
 lecjapfeud.6.t: "The Investigation Goes Nowhere"
 lecjapfeud.6.d: "Much to our frustration, Huang Jinrong has so far not turned up any leads. After a long period of radio silence he's finally contacted us again only to inform us that he's managed to turn up nothing but dead ends. While the long period without results has no doubt been as frustrating to him, he insists that the trial has gone cold, likely due to the amount of heat that the last fight and the public humiliation brought on by our publicly applied pressure. While a conclusive end to the investigation seems unlikely at this point, if what he says is true it should at least mean that we're not going to see any further escalations on this matter. Be that as it may, the investigation continues."
 lecjapfeud.6.a: "Something seems shady about this..."
 lecjapfeud.7.t: "Huang Jinrong Raises Suspicions"
 lecjapfeud.7.d: "Shortly after his reports to us, the police commissioner of Tianjin raised the alarm that 'pockmarked' Huang Jinrong himself may be implicated in this matter through his ties to the Green Gang, itself also implicated in the matter. The suspicion was raised when he seemed to deliberately and repeatedly omitted details in his recent reports which the Tianjin police knew to be the case. Because of this, the investigation is now turning around towards the supposed investigator himself with the Tianjin police department already on the case.\n\nIt may not have gone as planned, we have at least found our crook and been able to start shutting down the Triad activity tied to this case. If nothing else, the investigation has managed to direct the heat against the Chinese criminal interests in the cities. This should also push the Japanese fighting behind the scenes, at least for now, as their alleged Triad contacts are feeling the heat."
 lecjapfeud.7.a: "You just can't find good help these days."
 lecjapfeud.8.t: "Financial Crimes Uncovered"
 lecjapfeud.8.d: "The American investigation was quick to bear fruit. With a heavy focus on financial transactions and economic interests as it pertains to the Japanese factions that sparked this whole situation, the bureau claims to be close to making a breakthrough. Apparently, the business interests tied to the Japanese did not cover their tracks."
 lecjapfeud.8.a: "Finally, some good news!"
 lecjapfeud.9.t: "Lothar Eisenträger Implicated"
 lecjapfeud.9.d: "Rather surprisingly, the investigation has had a breakthrough that uncovered something we did not expect. Lothar Eisenträger, a major German figure in the legations, has been implicated in this affair. Having had ties to the Japanese businesses that were financially tied to the disputes, the eyes of the law enforcement are now on him and the illicit financial activities he was tied to. As an added bonus, the heat being brought down on these business ties seems to have forced the Japanese factions to settle their disputes behind the scenes rather than on the streets."
 lecjapfeud.9.a: "And that's the end of that!"
 lecjapfeud.10.t: "Investigations into Chinese Markets"
 lecjapfeud.10.d: "The German bureau that we hired to investigate the matter has focused on financial crimes pertaining to the broader Chinese markets, believing that this is where they'd be most likely to find leads from a shady transaction. They seem to have been correct about their assessments, and are at this moment pursuing numerous leads. We should be seeing positive results in the near future."
 lecjapfeud.10.a: "Better than nothing."
 lecjapfeud.11.t: "Connections to Zhejiang Uncovered"
 lecjapfeud.11.d: "The German investigation has wound its way beyond the Legation Cities into Zhejiang and Fujian, the domain of the Kuomintang bandits. It seems that the Japanese-funded gangs were KMT proxies the Japanese used to eliminate their rivals within the Japanese structure. On their recommendation, we have increased security in Shantou and Ningbo and the Japanese activity has seemingly quieted."
 lecjapfeud.11.a: "The Germans blamed the socialists, what a surprise..."
 lecjapfeud.12.t: "비공식적인 중재"
 lecjapfeud.12.d: "Discretion is sometimes the better option, even if it may not entirely line up with protocol. Now then, we must choose which intermediary to go through. Although under the control of the Japanese Consulate, the China Agency would be an obvious choice as it would provide a direct and discreet channel of communications with the Japanese. Some claim, however, that approaching them would mean that we'd be dealing on Japanese terms. Although unorthodox, they suggest that going through the Triads using the leads we got from our earlier investigations. Going through them, we could be able to put more direct pressure on the Japanese in our dealings with them as they have relied on these Triads to do their inter-factional dirty work for now."
 lecjapfeud.12.a: "Go through the China Agency."
 lecjapfeud.12.b: "Use the Triads as middlemen."
 lecjapfeud.13.t: "Contacting the Triads"
 lecjapfeud.13.d: "Contacting the Triads is not without risks, so let's hope we've made the right choice. Our options, based on the information we got from the arrests that the police made earlier, seem to be either Du Yuesheng or Zhang Xiaolin. Du is lower on the rung and has a notable role in the red light scene in Shanghai. Allegedly, some of the hired guns answer to him. Zhang on the other hand is probably the largest crime boss active in the Legations. Anything that could be tied to the Japanese involvement has likely passed through him at some point."
 lecjapfeud.13.a: "Approach Du Yuesheng, he's tied to this."
 lecjapfeud.13.b: "Zhang Xiaolin holds the cards, contact him."
 lecjapfeud.14.t: "Triads Backstab Us!"
 lecjapfeud.14.d: "Our dealing with the Triads blew up in our faces! They sold us out to the Japanese and are extorting us over our dealings with them. To say that this limits our ability to act on the matter would be an understatement..."
 lecjapfeud.14.a: "They want HOW much to keep this quiet?!"
 lecjapfeud.15.t: "Escalation of Violence"
 lecjapfeud.15.d: "We hoped that the violence would die down after the last incident. Instead, our inaction towards any of the main parties in this dispute has allowed them to continue their fighting. Yesterday an incident similar to the one that started this occurred, and today there was an arson attack against the residence of a member of the Japanese department for colonial affairs, no doubt tied to the brewing miniature war between these branches of the Japanese government any military. With the way things are going, the Tianjin police department is requesting more resources to deal with the spike in violence."
 lecjapfeud.15.a: "Deploy extra police from Shanghai!"
 lecjapfeud.16.t: "Gangs Used As Proxies"
 lecjapfeud.16.d: "As the violence escalates, it's becoming increasingly obvious that the Japanese military factions are hiring Triads and other Chinese gangs to fight their battles against each other for them. The fighting reached a fever pitch in recent days, and only the arrival of more police from other parts of the Legations seem to have had a marginal calming effect on things. Their investigators seem to believe, however, that a more likely reason for the gradual decrease in violence is because one of the factions is close to winning."
 lecjapfeud.16.a: "Which one will it be?"
 lecjapfeud.17.t: "Zhang Xiaolin's Shady Dealings"
 lecjapfeud.17.d: "In recent days, the fighting that briefly became a daily affair in the Legations has died down to nothing. With a final death toll in the dozens and several arrests being made, the power struggle between the Japanese factions has reached a conclusion. Whoever the victor is should become clear once one of the departments become more prominent in the weeks ahead. More importantly however, with one faction coming out on top we can expect the Japanese to take the initiative without these internal restrictions holding them back."
 lecjapfeud.17.a: "He should have quit while he was ahead..."
 lecjapfeud.18.t: "The Japanese Are Emboldened"
 lecjapfeud.18.d: "In recent days, the fighting that briefly became a daily affair in the Legations has died down to nothing.

More importantly however, with one faction coming out on top we can expect the Japanese to take the initiative without these internal restrictions holding them back."
 lecjapfeud.18.a: "This is probably bad for us."
 lecjapfeud.19.t: "The Japanese Resolve Their Differences"
 lecjapfeud.19.d: "Going through the China Agency, we used the evidence we had to help the Japanese resolve their factional disputes. The fact that the Japanese military, navy, colonial department and foreign ministries have severe differences is no secret, but through a series of difficult negotiations we've managed to help resolve their disputes behind the scenes. With the conflict defused, business as usual soon returned to the cities.\n\nAlthough some are unhappy with this development as it means that the infighting that put a cap on the growth of Japanese influence has diminished thanks to this new inter-agency cooperation and bolstered role of the China Agency, most are just happy that further tragedy was averted."

The 1936 election has borne a strange result, the election of the Progressive Floyd Olson on a National Unity ticket. It would seem that, hoping to preserve American democracy, the Republican and Democratic Parties have temporarily united to defeat the radical threat. While the National Unity Party’s overriding focus is internal stability and not diplomacy or power projection, that very focus has convinced many investors in the Cities that the Americans will remain a stabilising presence for years to come."

 lecyankded.7.t: "President Long's Actions Destabilise the Cities"
 lecyankded.7.d: "It seems that newly elected President Long has begun a process of extensive political reform designed to radically transform America.

 lecyankded.8.d: "Shocking news has come from the United States over the past couple of days. It seems that the Chief of Staff, General Douglas MacArthur, has taken complete control of the government, apparently in response to 'improper actions' by the President. However this crisis resolves itself, this has put an enormous dent in the Legation Cities' faith in America. Some bookmarkers in Shanghai are even offering good odds that America will soon fall into civil war again."
 lecyankded.8.a: "This won't have a happy ending."
 lecyankded.9.t: "Civil Disorder in the United States"
 lecyankded.9.both: "It would seem that the new president, [USA.GetLeader], has been unable to pacify the turmoil that is American politics. The Socialists and the Longists have both risen up in the Steel Belt and the Deep South, respectively. President [USA.GetLeader] has assured the international community that democracy is still alive in America, and that once he diffuses the current crisis America will return to prosperity."
 lecyankded.9.long: "It seems that the new president of the United States, [USA.GetLeader], has pacified the socialists and associated unions and strikers in the north. Enraged with these actions, the rightist radical Huey Long has risen up in the South, though unlike the last time the South rebelled he has declared he has no intention of seceding, but instead intends to restore 'rightful American values' to the nation. Though public confidence in America has been greatly shaken by these events, most remain confident that President [USA.GetLeader] will be able to resolve the situation."
 lecyankded.9.reed: "It seems that the new president of the United States, [USA.GetLeader], has pacified Huey Long and the America First Party in the South. Subsequently, the leftist unions and Socialist Party of America have risen up in the north, outraged by the actions of the government.

 lecyankded.10.d: "As many predicted, General MacArthur's seizure of power in the United States has triggered a crisis, as both Huey Long of the AFP and Jack Reed of the SPA have denounced MacArthur and risen up in the south and north respectively. Many democratically-aligned officials have fled to regroup in the West under the banner of [PSA.GetNameDef], where they have denounced all who seek to destroy the American way of life. With such chaos in the United States, the people of the Legation Cities have lost all hope they might ever have had for American power and influence coming to aid the Cities in need, and public confidence in the American-run Council has plummeted still further."

 lecyankded.11.d: "As many have anticipated since the crisis in American politics began, the United States have fallen into civil war yet again. This has created a power vacuum in the Far East, as America was one of the strongest proponents of the status quo, and its embodiment in the Legation Cities. With them temporarily out of the picture, the very fundamental nature of the Cities will undoubtedly change radically. The first thing to be decided by the Council is what the new voting arrangements for America are, and more importantly which America we are to recognise. If the American voting rights are removed, it is likely that a new High Commissioner will then be elected by the Council. What is sure is that these will be uncertain times for the Mandate."

 lecyankded.12.b: "We should consider amending their situation."
 lecyankded.13.t: "The Political Future of the Legation Cities"
 lecyankded.13.d: "The only change in leadership in the Legation Council’s short history has been the replacement of Stirling Fessenden with his chosen successor, Nelson Johnson. Then, in the heyday of the Cities in 1932, there was no doubt in any ambassador’s mind that a continued American presence was needed, and the transfer of power was smooth. Now, however, with the American civil war raging, the American China Marines withdrawing from Shanghai, and China in chaos, things are different.\n\nWith the invocation of Article 14, High Commissioner Johnson has chosen to step down temporarily, in order to ensure a fair vote. The Council then unanimously voted in Erwin von Zach, the Austro-Hungarian delegate, as the temporary High Commissioner, and the politicking began. The Germans and Japanese delegations, each of which were receiving constant communications from their government instructing them to secure the post of High Commissioner, argued constantly that their opposite number and America were both incapable of protecting the consular powers interests in the Far East, and that only their nation could successfully keep the peace.\n\nThough the American ambassador at a critical time to his country’s fate, Mr Johnson himself appeared quite worn out, and the voice of America in the chamber was mostly provided by Patrick Hurley, the current Deputy Commissioner. He argued that the United States was sure to emerge from the civil war even stronger than before, and that they would surely come to Shanghai’s aid at any time. This notion was almost universally derided throughout the Council, and Pyotr Tiedemann, the Russian representative, was heard to mutter to his neighbour that ‘the Americans are a spent force in Asia forever.’\n\nAny effect the surprise of proffering his own nation as a dark horse candidate might have provided was soon robbed of him, as the British ambassador rose to speak. He dealt eloquently with the American conflict, and Mr Johnson was seen to give his first weary smile of the session. Acting-Administrator Smith also dealt ably with the Japanese and German ambassador’s criticisms of his home country’s status on the Council. Who better, he argued, to preside over the Council than a member with no vote? This was met with quiet consternation from the German and Japanese delegations, but Mr Hurley was seen speaking to Acting-Administrator Smith as the Council adjourned. After dinner, Ambassador von Zach motioned for a vote, and the ambassadors took their seat once more. In the end, it seems the Council believed..."

 lecyankded.14.d: "Following the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, the Legation Cities, heavily reliant on American protection and influence, fell into a power vacuum. The Legation Council had to vote on a new High Commissioner to lead the Mandate into the future, and it seems they have chosen for the incumbent American High Commissioner, [LEC.GetLeader], to stay in the role.

 lecyankded.19.d: "As some weeks have passed since the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, and the High Commissioner has done nothing, the Japanese delegation in Shanghai has invoked Article 14 of the Legation Treaty, which calls for a leadership change if the current High Commissioner's nation is unwilling or unable to provide backing to the Mandate. While we were planning to do this ourselves soon, our lack of political capital has allowed the Japanese to get one over on us."
 lecyankded.19.a: "How were they privy to our intentions?"
 lecyankded.20.t: "미국 정부 인정"
 lecyankded.20.d: "As the United States falls into anarchy, their status in the Cities is left in doubt. While the civil war’s eventual victor would be well placed to claim their voting rights on the Council, recognising one faction or another would surely lead to international condemnation, as we could hardly satisfy every power and their desires. Helpfully, we have an easy precedent to follow to our north, where both Vladivostok and Moscow claim the title of the true Russia, and as such Russia’s seat on the council. Just as we grant both nations’ emissaries observer rights, so shall we do the same in America."
 lecyankded.20.a: "A simple solution."
 lecyankded.21.t: "The Legation Cities Grant Us Observer Rights"
 lecyankded.21.d: "The Legation Cities have made the decision to grant representatives from all nations involved in the Second American Civil War access to the Council chambers. Much like Britain and Russia, we are now effectively locked out of decision-making in the mandate."
 lecyankded.21.a: "They have no spine in Shanghai!"
 lecyankded.22.t: "The Legation Cities Grant All American Factions Observer Rights"
 lecyankded.22.d: "Knowing that there was no way that all members of the Legation Council could come to agreement and recalling the example of Russia, where both Vladivostok and Moscow send emissaries to Shanghai, the Council has decided to grant all American factions, saving the red uprising in the north, observer rights on the Council."
 lecyankded.22.a: "A good compromise."
 lecyankded.23.t: "[FROM.GetName]의 의결권 복권 요청"
 lecyankded.23.d: "The American representative in Shanghai has requested the return of the American voting rights owed to it by the Legation Treaty, since their concessions remain unconfiscated. While we could refuse, snubbing the newly reunited America could be a foolish action. However, maybe it would be best to limit their influence in China in the near future."
 lecyankded.23.a: "이사회에서 이에 관한 투표를 진행해야만 한다."
 lecyankded.23.b: "상임위원장이 알아서 해결할 것이다."
 lecyankded.23.c: "America will never return to prominence in the East!"
 lecyankded.24.t: "The Legation Council Votes on Restoring America's Rights"
 lecyankded.24.d: "Now that America has been reunited, it has been seeking to restore its power worldwide, and has petitioned the Legation Council for the return of its voting rights. While they acted as a force of stability in Asia before, would it really be wise to limit our own power even further?"
 lecyankded.24.a: "공정하게 투표하겠다."
 lecyankded.25.t: "아국의 의결권 복권에 대해 투표하기 시작한 공사관이사회"
 lecyankded.25.d: "The Legation Council has agreed to our request for a vote on returning our voting rights, and the great powers' emissaries have already begun debating fiercely over the subject."
 lecyankded.25.a: "좋은 소식 같군."
 lecyankded.26.t: "\"미국의 의결권 복권안\"의 투표 결과"
 lecyankded.26.d: "The results of the vote on restoring American voting rights have been announced, and it seems the motion has..."
 lecyankded.26.a: "가결됐습니다!"
 lecyankded.26.b: "부결됐습니다!"
 lecyankded.27.t: "The Legation Council Votes to Restore Our Rights"
 lecyankded.27.d: "The assembled powers of the Legation Council have seen sense and have voted to restore our voting rights on the Council. We may now exert some more influence in the Far East, and we are a little closer to regaining our power."
 lecyankded.27.a: "좋았어!"
 lecyankded.28.t: "The Legation Council Votes Against Restoring Our Rights"
 lecyankded.28.d: "The assembled powers of the Legation Council have voted not to restore our voting rights, deeming us incapable of asserting control in China to protect our concessions. We are left with observer rights permanently, it seems."
 lecyankded.28.a: "망할."
 lecyankded.29.t: "The Legation Council Restores America's Voting Rights"
 lecyankded.29.d: "In response to the American motion to restore voting rights to that nation after the end of their civil war, the High Commissioner has unilaterally granted them their wishes, without even calling a vote. America is on their way to returning to prominence in Asia."
 lecyankded.29.a: "We should have been involved in that decision!"
 lecyankded.30.t: "The Legation Council Restores Our Voting Rights"
 lecyankded.30.d: "The High Commissioner has agreed with out request to return our voting rights on the Legation Council, without even consulting the other powers. While it has angered some of the other great powers, informed members of the populace are rejoicing."
 lecyankded.30.a: "대단하군!"
 lecyankded.31.t: "The Legation Council Refuses to Restore America's Voting Rights"
 lecyankded.31.d: "In response to the American petition to restore their voting rights on the Legation Council, the High Commissioner has unilaterally shut them down. They are too unstable to return to prominence in the Far East, he implied. Whether the Americans will request it again is unknown, but what is certain is that we should have been consulted on this important matter."
 lecyankded.31.a: "The status quo prevails."
 lecyankded.32.t: "The Legation Council Refuses to Restore Our Rights"
 lecyankded.32.d: "The High Commissioner in Shanghai has refused our request without even consulting the member nations of the Council. This is an outrage!"
 lecyankded.32.a: "We are powerless in China."
 lecyankded.33.t: "Ambassador Johnson Offers to Resign"
 lecyankded.33.d: "With the outbreak of the civil war, the Legation Council was deprived of American support, and has consequently lost some legitimacy. Our ambassador in Shanghai, Nelson T Johnson, has proposed a move to restore some American prestige in Shanghai - his own resignation. He reasons that since he is associated with the failing regime in America, our interests in Asia would be better served by replacing him with his deputy, Patrick J Hurley. Hurley is a more forceful man, but might be a block in eventual reunion between the Legation Cities and China."
 lecyankded.33.a: "Replace Johnson, he's served his time."
 lecyankded.33.b: "He can be useful yet."
 lecyankded.34.t: "Ambassador Johnson Replaced"
 lecyankded.34.d: "Following the recent leadership contest, the American government in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has replaced Ambassador Nelson T Johnson with the long-time Deputy High Commissioner of the Legation Cities, Patrick Hurley. They seem to believe this will shore up faith in America here in the Far East."
 lecyankded.34.a: "Good luck, Mr Hurley."
 lecyankded.35.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Government Confirms Ambassador Johnson"
 lecyankded.35.d: "Although the American ambassador, Nelson Johnson, offered his resignation to the American government in the west, President [Root.GetLeader] has refused his resignation. They believe his presence is a stabilising one, and that he is more amenable to political change than his suggested successor, Patrick Hurley."
 lecyankded.35.a: "He'll do his job well enough."
 lecyankded.40.t: "The United States Sends Troops to Shanghai"
 lecyankded.40.d: "Citing security concerns following the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, the Americans have sent more troops to the volunteer force in Shanghai, as well as reinforcing their own China Marines. This has increased American popularity in the Cities, as well as boosting our manpower."
 lecyankded.40.a: "Seems like a good deal."
 lecyankded.41.t: "The China Marines Leave Shanghai"
 lecyankded.41.d: "With the outbreak of the civil war, the American government has recalled the 4th Marine Regiment, popularly referred to as the 'China Marines,' back to America. While American interests in the Far East can only be hurt by this retreat, the American government, in the midst of a civil war, has clearly decided that domestic commitments are more important than foreign ones. Charles F. B. Price led his troops through the city of Shanghai this morning in a grand parade before boarding the USS President Harrison, whereupon, along with many of the American Yangtze Patrol gunboats, they steamed out of the harbour. Soon after the last ships crossed the horizon, the streets were back to normal."
 lecyankded.41.a: "I hope they weren't needed."
 lectianjap.1.t: "Attacks In Tianjin"
 lectianjap.1.d: "With Black Monday's ill effects leading to a collapse in living standards of native Chinese in the Mandate, various mobs have been forming trying to find someone to blame for these conditions. In Tianjin, Japanese Buddhists have been beaten, robbed and in some cases murdered. The Japanese are incensed and have offered to send a garrison of their own to maintain order in the city and prevent further attacks. However, this is extremely unpopular with other members of the Council. While allowing Japan to get involved would take a burden off our own limited resources, it could give them additional influence in the Council."
 lectianjap.1.a: "Accept, it's not like we can handle it ourselves."
 lectianjap.1.b: "Refuse - its our duty to maintain security in the cities, not Japan's."
 lectianjap.2.t: "Operations Secured In Tianjin"
 lectianjap.2.d: "Our troops have finally gained a stranglehold on our concession within Tianjin, granting us a formidable base to consolidate our military operations in China. While this is certainly not enough to allow passage to Fengtian, the military high command are already exploring options to destabilise the city and give our troops legitimate reasoning to enact a full scale occupation."
 lectianjap.2.a: "All according to plan..."
 lectianjap.2.b: "This has gone quite far enough, cancel any further plans!"
 lectianjap.3.t: "테러범들의 톈진 공격!"
 lectianjap.3.d: "Horrible news has reached Shanghai! A bomb has just gone off in the old town of Tianjin! Scores of innocent people are dead and even more are wounded as the fire and medical services scramble to get the survivors treatment. The police have already began an investigation and have pointed the finger at the native Chinese and have promised that this just another act of the anti-concessionist movement. The Chinese themselves are incensed they are taking the blame and have claimed dark forces are at work from beyond the shadows."
 lectianjap.3.a: "Well that was a speedy investigation."
 lectianjap.4.t: "Rioting In Tianjin!"
 lectianjap.4.d: "Following the terrorist attack in Tianjin, the Japanese forces have shown great eagerness in their own crackdown on anti-concessionist forces, often surpassing the official investigators in brutality, angering an already incensed population. The tensions have finally hit a crisis with mass rioting engulfing the city. The Japanese delegation in Shanghai has warned that with the situation continuing to spiral out of control, the Empire will have no choice but to take 'pre-emptive action' in doing what we cannot. Meanwhile the authorities in Tianjin have taking executive action and began dealing with the rioters themselves, promising some semblance of reform. While much of the council is prepared to turn a blind eye, others and especially Japan have called for this to be vetoed, citing that this is in direct dispute of the Council's mandate."
 lectianjap.4.a: "Veto them, we don't want to anger the council"
 lectianjap.4.b: "Keep the reforms to a minimum..."
 lectianjap.5.t: "Terrorist Attack In Tianjin Foiled!"
 lectianjap.5.d: "In the early hours of the morning, an explosive device failed to detonate properly and the Tianjin police were able to disarm it before the bomb could do any real harm. A manhunt for the terrorist has already begun - though with little evidence as to who may have planted it, there isn't much hope for a speedy investigation or a good result. Huang Jinrong has been called upon to investigate the attempted bombing, though the German delegation has proposed their own investigative team take charge citing Huang's less than scrupulous methods."
 lectianjap.5.a: "Let the Germans investigate."
 lectianjap.5.b: "Allow Jinrong to proceed."
 lectianjap.6.t: "Arms Shipment Discovered!"
 lectianjap.6.d: "During a routine custom's inspection of a ship docking in Shanghai, a massive cache of weapons has been discovered with all of the crew aboard being put under arrest until further notice with the ship officially seized. An official investigation is under way and is expected to get some results soon."
 lectianjap.6.a: "Never a dull day in Shanghai!"
 lectianjap.7.t: "Japanese Guns In A Russian Ship"
 lectianjap.7.d: "The investigation has finally returned and gathered up all the evidence available to them. The ship itself is Russian in origin, registered to a shipping company in Vladivostok but the guns are Japanese in nature and comprised mostly out of obsolete Arisakas. The crew have given no useful leads and it appears we will have to track this down to the source, either investigating the shipping company in Vladivostok or calling on the Japanese to assist."
 lectianjap.7.a: "Look into the shipping company."
 lectianjap.7.b: "Call the Japanese for assistance."
 lectianjap.8.t: "블라디보스토크에서의 따뜻한 하루"
 lectianjap.8.d: "Our agents in the Russian port city of Vladivostok have recently contacted us with an interesting lead. After having obtained manifests from the shipping company it appears that the arms were being sold to the China Agency with Japan using the Russian shipping route to clear suspicion and launder the weapons. Now with this evidence our agents in the Legations can begin an official investigation into the China Agency."
 lectianjap.8.a: "무언가 이상한데..."
 lectianjap.9.t: "The Investigation Gets Stonewalled"
 lectianjap.9.d: "The Japanese have been less than cooperative with our detectives, either outright refusing to help or giving vague or downright bizarre answers. It seems that the Japanese will be of no help in this investigation and we will to go down other avenues of investigation... The Green Gang are the obvious choice, assuming their leaders haven't been incarcerated."
 lectianjap.9.a: "The Green Gang don't seem like too bad fellows..."
 lectianjap.10.t: "Japanese Intrigue In China"
 lectianjap.10.d: "With an official investigation of the China Agency having gone under way we have finally reached the bottom of these arms shipments and it appears that the Japanese are arming loyal collaborators in preparation for a full scale invasion and occupation of China. Now that the genie is out of the bottle we will have to pick a side, either offering the Japanese a deal or attempting to crackdown on their smuggling."
 lectianjap.10.a: "Let's cut them a deal."
 lectianjap.10.b: "Start a crackdown."
 lectianjap.11.t: "Offering A Deal"
 lectianjap.11.d: "In some dirty backroom somewhere in one of Shanghai's many backstreets representatives from the China Agency have met with representatives from the Legations Council. The China Agency are aware we're onto them and now it is time for us to press down the boot. We can obviously look the other way to their indiscretions on the condition that they..."
 lectianjap.11.a: "... grant us some future favours."
 lectianjap.11.b: "... give us everything they have on Du Yuesheng."
 lectianjap.12.t: "Beginning The Crackdown"
 lectianjap.12.d: "With full knowledge of the indiscretions of the China Agency it is time to put the boot down and remind the Japanese that the Legations are not mere pawns in their game for China. Huang Jinrong is the obvious choice to lead the crackdown but his criminal connections could compromise the status of the council. While the Chamber of Commerce has put itself forward as a more 'moral' alternative, many commissioners doubt their capabilities."
 lectianjap.12.a: "Huang Jinrong will lead the crackdown."
 lectianjap.12.b: "The Chamber of Commerce is a more palatable choice."
 lectianjap.13.t: "The Crackdown Succeeds!"
 lectianjap.13.d: "Good news has reached Shanghai! The crackdown against the China Agency has went exceptionally well despite the best attempts by the Japanese to obstruct us. With the China Agency defanged and its operations limited solely to its more legal avenues we have removed one of the larger thorns in our side. While the Japanese are internally seething, there is little they can do now."
 lectianjap.13.a: "Stability returns to Shanghai!"
 lectianjap.14.t: "탄압 실패!"
 lectianjap.14.d: "Terrible news has reached Shanghai! The crackdown against the China Agency has gone horribly wrong! The organisation was able to successfully hide in the deep underbellies of the city and obscure its more illegal operations. While this will have little short-term effect, in the long term Japan will be able to regroup and bolster their operations."
 lectianjap.14.a: "음... 좋지 않아..."
 lectianjap.15.t: "청방의 도움 "
 lectianjap.15.d: "While it is unfortunate we have to ask for help from common gangsters, with the Japanese proving unwilling to cooperate, we have had to turn to less than orthodox means. By offering to turn a few blind eyes, The Green Gang has agreed to do some investigation work for us and has come to the conclusion that the Japanese are using the China Agency to funnel arms to their contacts in the Chinese interior with the Legation Cities as the smuggling point. While this evidence is flimsy at best we could use it as a prerogative for a more... official investigation."
 lectianjap.15.a: "This could prove very interesting..."
 lectianjap.18.t: "Shanghai Says Yes!"
 lectianjap.18.d: "Great news from Shanghai, the Mandate has agreed to give us a green light to further operations in Tianjin. It seems that their economic woes were just too much to maintain security in the city. Regardless, this greatly benefits ourselves and we can now beginning garrisoning more troops in Tianjin, making way for an eventual takeover."
 lectianjap.18.a: "도미노들이 무너지기 시작했다..."
 lectianjap.19.t: "일본군의 톈진 주둔"
 lectianjap.19.d: "공사관 도시가 경제위기로 인해 큰 타격을 입은 것으로 보이는 지금, 공사관 도시는 경제를 유지하기 위해 대부분의 보안 작업을 일본에 위탁하기로 했습니다. 그들을 막기 위해 우리가 할 수 있는 일은 거의 없었지만, 갑작스럽게 권력의 균형이 바뀌면서, 일본이 도시에서 그들의 지위를 남용하지 말라고 요구하자 이사회에서 한바탕 소동이 있었습니다."
 lectianjap.19.a: "아무리 생각해도 걱정스럽군."
 lectianjap.20.t: "Shanghai Refuses!"
 lectianjap.20.d: "Terrible news has come out of Shanghai! The International Council has refused to give us a green light to further expand military operations! This is a major blow to our plans to take over Tianjin and we will now have to wait for the China Agency to orchestrate more attacks before we can make our demands again."
 lectianjap.20.a: "Damn!"
 lectianjap.21.t: "테러범들의 톈진 공격!"
 lectianjap.21.d: "Earlier today an explosive device was detonated in the port city of Tianjin, killing scores of civilians and wounding many more. The police have claimed that this is simply a case of the anti-concessionist violence though the native Chinese are adamant that 'dark forces' are at work, with some wondering if this has any relation to our recent involvement of Tianjin. Obviously the military has claimed it has nothing to do with them."
 lectianjap.21.a: "우린 모르는 일이야!"
 lectianjap.22.t: "Japan Demands A Security Garrison"
 lectianjap.22.d: "Members of the Japanese delegation have petitioned the mandate to grant Japan a green light to begin security operations in Tianjin. Arguing that the Tianjin Police have been unable to stem the tide of attacks they now believe that only their own troops can guarantee the safety of their citizens."
 lectianjap.22.a: "그거 좋은 지적이군..."
 lectianjap.22.b: "여기가 일본 조계지인줄 아나?"
 lectianjap.23.t: "Huang Jinrong Returns"
 lectianjap.23.d: "Huang Jinrong has come to us with glorious news having caught the bomber - one of the usual miscreant native Chinese though under interrogation he admitted that he himself was not the mastermind behind the plot but instead a rogue Japanese officer. While the Japanese have court-martialled the officer and are attempting to distance themselves from the plot, this serves as a politically embarrassing incident."
 lectianjap.23.a: "Hurray!"
 lectianjap.24.t: "The Germans Return"
 lectianjap.24.d: "The German investigation returned with little luck, having apprehended only a few of the typical miscreants, none of which had shown any initiative or intelligence to construct the bomb and plan out such an attack. After successive interrogations the men were released and we find ourselves with no leads or clues. The Germans have admitted that their 'sources' have failed and promise they'll catch them next time."
 lectianjap.24.a: "Damn!"
 lectianjap.25.t: "톈진 침공?"
 lectianjap.25.d: "The Legation Council has gone bankrupt, spelling an end to the International Mandate. Now, as Shanghai devolves into street fights and chaos, the outlying cities of the Mandate are left unprotected. In Tianjin, rioters and gangs have mostly been suppressed, and the city police are slowly regaining control, aided by our troops and prominent Triads, all of whom are trying to secure the city for one faction or another.\n\nThere is not much time before Beijing hears the news, and they are almost guaranteed to try and take the city if they can. We have one opportunity to secure the city for ourselves before they can mobilise - should we take it?"
 lectianjap.25.a: "Dispatch our troops!"
 lectianjap.25.b: "Let China have it."
 lectianjap.26.t: "The Japanese Invasion of Tianjin"
 lectianjap.26.d.default: "The Japanese have invaded Tianjin with the full power of the IJN supporting their troops already in their concessions there. They claim to be merely helping us secure the city from unidentified bandits, but this move is clearly very aggressive and beyond the normal parametres of Japanese movements in the Mandate."
 lectianjap.26.d.bankrupt: "The Japanese have invaded Tianjin with the full power of the IJN supporting their troops already in their concessions there. With the Legations in chaos due to their recent bankruptcy, nothing could be done to avoid this outcome."
 lectianjap.26.a: "We cannot hope to resist them."
 lectianjap.26.b: "But resist we must."
 lectianjap.26.c: "Awful!"
 lectianjap.27.t: "Tianjin Successfully Captured"
 lectianjap.27.d.peace: "Tianjin is in our hands! Our troops easily sailed into the second city of the Mandate, and are occupying it even now."
 lectianjap.27.d.war: "Surprisingly, the Legation Cities have responded to our invasion with incredible hostility, and though we have occupied Tianjin, we are now in a state of war with them."
 lectianjap.27.a: "All according to plan."
 lectianjap.28.t: "The Administration of Tianjin"
 lectianjap.28.d: "Though, of course, we have admitted the Mandate still is sovereign in Tianjin, we can do, in effect, whatever we want with it. Some, in order to expedite the war with the Central Government by our Fengtian allies, propose handing it over to them, while others wish to keep it for ourselves."
 lectianjap.28.a: "We will retain it for now."
 lectianjap.28.b: "Hand it over to the rightful Chinese government."
 lectianjap.29.t: "Japan Hands Over Tianjin to Us"
 lectianjap.29.d: "The Japanese have recently occupied Tianjin, and have been deliberating the fate of the city. Happily for us, they have decided to restore the city’s administration to the rightful Chinese government, and our troops have already moved into the city. This is a great day for all Chinese!"
 lectianjap.29.a: "One step closer to reunifying China!"
 lectianjap.30.t: "톈진 점령"
 lectianjap.30.d: "With pro-Japanese forces having gained control of the Legation Council, they are now beginning to exert their influence. The Legation Council has not only recognised us, they have invited our troops into Tianjin to \"secure the city\" from the threat of the hostile illegitimate Chinese government. Though our troops can now enter the city and we effectively administer much of the city, most of the profits Tianjin generates still go to Shanghai."
 lectianjap.30.a: "Still, an enormous coup!"
 lectianjap.30.b: "In that case, it's not worth it."
 lectianjap.31.t: "[FNG.GetNameDefCap] Occupies Tianjin"
 lectianjap.31.d: "The Fengtian government, with the assistance of the Japanese and the Legation Council, has occupied Tianjin, opening another flanking front for their troops in the coming war. This has energised our people even further to expel the imperial collaborators from our land, but there is little we can do, for now. "
 lectianjap.31.a: "Awful!"
 lectianjap.32.t: "Weapons Stockpiles in the Legation Cities"
 lectianjap.32.d: "Some of our friends in Shanghai have suggested a cunning plan to enrich all and aid our coming war in China - we will provide our agents in the Cities with weapons, and when we are fighting our war they shall smuggle them back to our forces. This will greatly aid our supply lines."
 lectianjap.32.a: "Sounds like a plan."
 lectianjap.33.t: "The Legation Cities Supply Our Troops"
 lectianjap.33.d: "The pro-Japanese but ostensibly neutral council in Shanghai have been secretly charged by our Japanese allies to deliver our ground troops with weapons smuggled across the neutral zones, and they have done just that."
 lectianjap.33.a: "Good news."
 lectianjap.34.t: "봉천의 수락"
 lectianjap.34.d: "[FNG.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our offer of free passage through Tianjin, meaning they have also accepted our demand of continuing to receive the profits of Mandate-owned industries and Mandatory protective tariffs from nations not on the Council."
 lectianjap.34.a: "Cooperation is good for everybody."
 lectianjap.35.t: "Fengtian Refuses"
 lectianjap.35.d: "[FNG.GetNameDefCap] has refused our offer of free passage through Tianjin, as they are unwilling to accept our terms for retaining many of the profits that the city provides. Tianjin will remain part of the decaying Mandate for now."
 lectianjap.35.a: "We can serve the Empire better than they can, anyway."
 lectianjap.36.t: "[FNG.GetNameDefCap]'s Coup in Tianjin"
 lectianjap.36.d: "After almost two years of occupation, it seems the [FNG.GetAdjective] government no longer feels obliged to stay constant to the terms of our agreement. They have cancelled any shipments to Shanghai, and have put very competitive tariffs on goods coming into Tianjin."
 lectianjap.36.a: "How annoying."
 lectianjap.37.t: "Guns Smuggled Into Shanghai"
 lectianjap.37.d: "Japanese arisakas have found their way into Shanghai and are already being distributed to pro-Japanese collaborators within the Mandate and in areas of China far beyond. Of course there's nothing to see here..."
 lectianjap.37.a: "Guns come and go every day. We mustn't follow every one of them."
 lecfuzhou.1.t: "Triad Activity in Fuzhou"
 lecfuzhou.1.d: "One of the pre-eminent members of the Green Gang, Zhang Xiaolin, has begun opening store fronts and suppressing local crime in Fuzhou. This is one of the first times Xiaolin has attempted an independent operation in a different city from Shanghai, and this operation could reveal his style of conducting a gang. What will he order his men to do?"
 lecfuzhou.1.a: "Xiaolin's men are deadly."
 lecfuzhou.1.b: "Xiaolin's men expand the Triad organisation."
 lecfuzhou.1.c: "Xiaolin likes profit, however he can find it."
 lecfuzhou.2.t: "A Fight on the Docks"
 lecfuzhou.2.d: "In the Fuzhou port gang violence between Xiaolin's men and a local gang looking to curb Xiaolin's encroaching influence has broken out during a smuggling operation of the Green Gang. Xiaolin's men, intercepted by the rival gang, opened fire almost immediately, killing several and wounding many more. While they are a step closer to securing the dockyards of Fuzhou, their reputation has suffered."
 lecfuzhou.2.a: "More violence, great."
 lecfuzhou.3.t: "Heroin Production Goes Local"
 lecfuzhou.3.d: "Zhang Xiaolin, an important member of the Green Gang, has created a domestic Fuzhouan heroin production, making it unnecessary for him to smuggle the heroin from Shanghai, thus making his operations far more secure than they are currently."
 lecfuzhou.3.a: "We should crack down on the imports from Shanghai."
 lecfuzhou.3.b: "We should focus on stopping local refinement."
 lecfuzhou.4.t: "A New Temple Opens in the Town"
 lecfuzhou.4.d: "Zhang Xiaolin, an important member of the Green Gang, has gracefully sponsored a new temple in Fuzhou, however reports have surfaced that this temple is used more for smuggling drugs than religious worship."
 lecfuzhou.4.a: "What a waste of real estate."
 lecfuzhou.5.t: "Green Gang Secures Control of Shipping"
 lecfuzhou.5.d: "The Green Gang has taken over much of the shipping in Fuzhou, especially of the smuggling of drugs, with them finally being able to push out more smaller local Triads. These had been a thorn in the side of Xiaolin's Green Gang, as they attacked or intercepted smuggling of drugs before."
 lecfuzhou.5.a: "They better leave legal shipping alone!"
 lecfuzhou.6.t: "Drugs Proliferating"
 lecfuzhou.6.d: "Drugs have become more and more common in Fuzhou, with the police being unable to stop the spread of them, with the most popular drugs being opium and heroin. Many of the new drugs are being produced in Fuzhou, though Shanghai remains the hotbed of drug creation."
 lecfuzhou.6.a: "Where are the police when you need them?"
 lecfuzhou.7.t: "Zhang Xiaolin's New Powerbase"
 lecfuzhou.7.d: "Zhang Xiaolin has established Fuzhou as his new power base for his smuggling operations, giving him and the Green Gang a sizeable advantage over other, more local, Triads. He is using his new power base already to expand his smuggling operation elsewhere within China. Many within the government ask how we should respond to this new development, as he may be an useful ally, though some say his new rival and former partner Du Yuesheng could be a more valuable one. Some propose that the best course of action is simply to try and eradicate his gang from Fuzhou, now that he has proved himself a disturber of the peace."
 lecfuzhou.7.a: "Go to Du Yuesheng."
 lecfuzhou.7.b: "Try to root him out."
 lecfuzhou.7.c: "Work with Xiaolin."
 lechotung.1.t: "Strange Things At The Vermillion Society"
 lechotung.1.d: "The Vermillion Society is a collection of various clubs, informal groupings, secret societies and organisations made up of wealthy and influential men in the Mandate, often from Chinese or mixed-race backgrounds. The Society's nationalist leaning is an open secret and their funding of nationalist organisations throughout China is somewhat in the open, though it has never been confirmed to be true. The Society provides somewhat of a headache to the council and represents in the broadest terms Chinese influence in the Legations. Recently, Mandate financial auditors have discovered numerous irregularities in the funding of the Society with the trail leading back to Hong Kong. While there is no evidence as to whether or not this is simple tax evasion or a much grander conspiracy, we should investigate and see where the clues take us."
 lechotung.1.a: "Let's see where this goes..."
 lechotung.1.b: "Oh I don't know anything about tax evasion."
 lechotung.2.t: "The Hotung Connection"
 lechotung.2.d: "Our investigations have borne fruit and the paper trail leads back to none other than Sir Robert Hotung of Hong Kong. Hotung is one of Hong Kong's more influential businessman and is widely respected in the city and the Mandate at large. One of the richest men in Hong Kong, Hotung controls much of the city's largest enterprises and was able to expand his influence when the British were partially evicted. Hotung is a notable Chinese nationalist and was involved in the founding of the Vermillion Society when his Hong Kong based Chinese Club merged with similar groups, with Hotung still acting as the de facto chairman of the Hong Kong branch and is by far its most notable figure.\n\nDespite his leanings Hotung is ironically one of the larger supporters of the Legations among the Chinese crowd, seeing no contradiction in his support for both Chinese nationalism and the perceived safety of the cities. Despite all this it seems the old man is despairing at the situation of China and has began desperately funding nationalist organisations across the spectrum including the fledgling KMT, the Fengtian Government and Chen Jiongming's Federalists. While funding these organisations is not illegal, tax evasion is and it gives us an opportunity to crack the monetary lifelines of some of the Legations greatest existential threats."
 lechotung.2.a: "Sir Robert would surely understand."
 lechotung.3.t: "Questions Need To Be Asked"
 lechotung.3.d: "The initial investigation into the KMT connection regarding Sir Robert has not gone particularly brilliant. The investigation team has been unable to locate any KMT members beyond the usual low-ranking miscreants, all of whom are unaware to the greater workings of the Kuomintang machine. To make matters worse the KMT appear to be onto us and have since retreated to the shadows. If this investigation is to go any further we'll need to call in some help. China Agency operatives are notoriously efficient, though they may meet the same end as the Mandate investigators. Du Yuesheng is a known KMT sympathiser and could very easily lead us to the KMT cells in exchange for a favour or two..."
 lechotung.3.a: "Well they are very good at their jobs."
 lechotung.3.b: "Best of a bad bunch I suppose..."
 lechotung.4.t: "The Japanese Are On The Case!"
 lechotung.4.d: "After some drawn out negotiations, we have finally come to an amicable agreement with the Japanese. In exchange for offshoring the investigation to the China Agency, we'll look the other way on some of their more... illicit operations. While not exactly ethical, it does allow us to get to the bottom of this mystery and at a bargain too."
 lechotung.4.a: "All for the greater good, right?"
 lechotung.5.t: "The KMT Cell In Shanghai"
 lechotung.5.d: "The Japanese have come to us with some interesting results and have exposed a KMT cell operating in Shanghai itself. While this was always suspected, to finally have a confirmation as well as an insight into their operations. While much of the cell was able to escape and regroup, this proves some promising news for us."
 lechotung.5.a: "This better not get buggered up."
 lechotung.6.t: "Du Yuesheng's Collaboration"
 lechotung.6.d: "While it has always been an open secret that Du Yuesheng has sympathies for the KMT, with help from our allies in the China Agency, we have finally been able to prove his illegal involvement with the group, primarily in supplying weapons and counterfeited documents. This proves as both a blow to the KMT and primarily to Du's operations."
 lechotung.6.a: "The noose is closing in..."
 lechotung.7.t: "Cracked The KMT!"
 lechotung.7.d: "Great news! It seems our allies have held up and we have successfully taken the fight to the KMT managing the break their monetary lifeline. In the short-term this will not effect the wider Kuomintang but it does break their operations in the cities and has proven a heavy blow to the Vermillion Society."
 lechotung.7.a: "Hurray!"
 lechotung.8.t: "A Dead End"
 lechotung.8.d: "It seems the China Agency was not as resourceful as we had expected. During an operation in Shanghai, KMT Juntong agents were able to escape with important documents, destroying what had been left behind. While this serves as a boost to th Vermillion Society and to the Kuomintang, it at least damages the Japanese with heads beginning to role in Tokyo."
 lechotung.8.a: "Drat!"
 lechotung.9.t: "Into the Dragon's Den"
 lechotung.9.d: "Du Yuesheng is a known sympathiser of the rightist Kuomintang though with a special distaste for Wang Jingwei and his more socialist elements. Even better, he is a common criminal and not averse to doing dirty work for the right price... Du could easily help us sabotage the KMT connection but in exchange he will expect far more than a mere pound of flesh and has requested that we arrange an 'accident' at the Shanghai Police Archives."
 lechotung.9.a: "Well, if we have no choice..."
 lechotung.10.t: "상하이 경무서에서의 화재!"
 lechotung.10.d: "Horrible news has come in from Shanghai! A massive fire has broken out in the police archives with numerous case files being destroyed in the inferno. The fire brigade have desperately battled to save what they could but it ultimately resulted in the loss of the entire D section. Valuable files on Du Yuesheng have been lost to history, setting back our investigation into his affairs."
 lechotung.10.a: "Was it truly an accident?"
 lechotung.11.t: "A Book of Names"
 lechotung.11.d: "It seems that the inferno has had a silver lining. As the fire investigation team searched the rubble, a small black book was discovered and contained the names of Kuomintang agents, safehouses, weapons caches, dates of meetings and supply lines. With such a treasure chest of information the Kuomintang will melt in the face of the police."
 lechotung.11.a: "What a find!"
 lechotung.12.t: "Investigating The Fengtian Lead"
 lechotung.12.d: "Interestingly it seems some of Hotung's money is being deposited in the accounts of high-ranking members of the Fengtian governments and various companies involved with the Fengtian administration. Being the last stand of the Xinhai Order seems to have paid off for Zhang Zuolin with Hotung donating much of his money to the remaining republican government. We must tread carefully during this operation as some elements in Tokyo are unlikely to be thrilled to find us meddling in the affairs of Shenyang."
 lechotung.12.a: "Let's reach out to friends in the West..."
 lechotung.12.b: "Let's tell Japan what's happening."
 lechotung.13.t: "A Meeting With The Westerners"
 lechotung.13.d: "In one of the more opulent gentleman's clubs in Shanghai, a meeting between representatives from AmCham Shanghai, the Ostchina Direktorium, the Hong Kong Club and the Shanghai Municipal Council was under way to discuss their mutual issue of Hotung giving money to Fengtian. After lots of bickering the group eventually agreed to put together a joint investigation team to get to the bottom of what's going on. Though due to the high-profile nature of the meeting it won't be long before the Japanese spies catch on..."
 lechotung.13.a: "Did that window open itself?"
 lechotung.14.t: "상하이에서의 보고"
 lechotung.14.d: "Our operatives in the China Agency have informed us that a covert meeting between the western powers and western officials in the Shanghai Municipal Council has taken place to discuss the issue of Fengtian receiving Vermillion Society donations and this is surprising news to the foreign office. Much of the civilian government wishes to ignore the meeting and let the Mandate deal with this themselves so they can unwittingly push Fengtian further into our grip though some members of the military have called on us to veto the investigation immediately for the sake of Fengtian's stability."
 lechotung.14.a: "Well Fengtian is independent after all..."
 lechotung.14.b: "Veto the investigation! Only we are responsible for Fengtian's affairs."
 lechotung.15.t: "무언가 잘못되다"
 lechotung.15.d: "With the investigation into the Vermillion Society's illicit Fengtian contributions, it had unfortunately reached a snag with few leads coming up and many crucial witnesses 'forgetting' events. As the situation stalled, it became even worse as late yesterday evening a group of armed Chinese men broke into the investigation offices and began firing automatic weapons before setting fire to the building and escaping. No evidence was discovered but the Fengtian Government is suspected of the attack."
 lechotung.15.a: "젠장!"
 lechotung.16.t: "Japan Vetoes the Investigation"
 lechotung.16.d_west: "Today representatives of the China Agency appeared at the Shanghai police headquarters to pass on a note from Katsuo Okazaki, himself, simply stipulating that the investigation was to be called off by order of the Japanese Government and that they had exercised their veto. Unfortunately there is nothing we can do and the investigation must come to a halt."
 lechotung.16.d_jap: "Word has reached us from Tokyo that we are to abandon the investigation immediately. Any and all files on Robert Hotung's 'alleged' involvement in Fengtian are to be destroyed and Mandate investigators are forbidden from meddling in Fengtian's affairs from now on."
 lechotung.16.a: "Put it in the cold cases."
 lechotung.17.t: "Intrigue In Liangguang"
 lechotung.17.d_feds: "It seems that by investigating the Cantonese connection has paid off greatly with numerous interesting leads being discovered. After a few bribes to local officials we've been able to deduce that Sir Robert is heavily involved in the activities of Chen Jiongming and the Federalist movement. To continue our investigation we will have to dig deeper into this connection by either going to the heart of operations in Hong Kong or getting the Ostchina Direktorium to grant us some favours within the AOG."
 lechotung.17.d_lkmt: "It seems that by investigating the Cantonese connection has paid off greatly with numerous interesting leads being discovered.

 lechotung.17.a: "Into the heart of darkness we go."
 lechotung.17.b: "Well Guangzhou is close by..."
 lechotung.18.t: "Dinner At The Hong Kong Club"
 lechotung.18.d: "Despite the British ostensibly being evicted from the Legations, they continue to hold huge sway in their old colony of Hong Kong, primarily through the Hong Kong Club. During our investigation into Chen Jiongming's affairs in Canton, the Club has shown an interest in aiding us and appear to have been conducting an investigation of their own into him. A few bribes over a friendly dinner and this information could fall into our hands..."
 lechotung.18.a: "I think I'll have my steak well done."
 lechotung.19.t: "A Favour From The AOG"
 lechotung.19.d: "The AOG or Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung are a grouping of semi-legal territorial concessions throughout China, afforded to Germany by warlord Sun Chuanfang and they often been referred to as Germany's own Legation Cities. One of their primary base of operations is in the southern port city of Guangzhou near Hong Kong. It is no secret the Germans have been keeping tabs on the activities of Chen and other revolutionaries in the city. In exchange for some clout to the Ostchina Direktorium, the AOG will gladly take part in some information sharing."
 lechotung.19.a: "Pleasure doing business with you!"
 lechotung.20.t: "The Liangguang Connection Severed"
 lechotung.20.d: "It seems that our connections have paid off and we have struck a monumental blow to the Vermillion Society as some of their biggest allies has been cut off from funding. While in the short term this won't have much impact across the border, it has already wreaked havoc on the Vermillion Society as members are slowly beginning to get indicted of their financial crimes."
 lechotung.20.a: "You fought the law and the law won."
 lechotung.21.t: "홍콩에 도착한 천중민"
 lechotung.21.d: "Chen Jiongming, leader of the Chinese Federalist movement has arrived in Hong Kong, having been forced to go into exile recently from his native Guangdong. He has already become a guest speaker and close associate of the Vermillion Society and is currently staying with Sir Robert Hotung until he can find a more permanent accommodation. While his presence proves a minor headache for the Hong Kong Club, for the most part he doesn't appear capable of causing any major revolts for the time being."
 lechotung.21.a: "참으로 아이러니하군."
 lechotung.22.t: "천중밍의 망명 중 사망"
 lechotung.22.d: "News has arrived today that Chen Jiongming, the Chinese Federalist leader, has died from typhus in Hong Kong. Having suffered from ill health since his move to Hong Kong, it seems Chen finally succumbed to his diseases and passed on. The nationalist Vermillion Society in the Legation Cities mourns his death, as well as one of their causes célèbres - without its founder, what remains of the Federalist movement has collapsed."
 lechotung.22.a: "고히 잠드소서."
 lechotung.23.t: "Legation Dollars in Shenyang"
 lechotung.23.d: "A report has just come in from our agents in Shanghai that leading philanthropist, Robert Hotung, is secretly funding the Fengtian Government with his vast wealth. Members of the military believe that this could work in our favour as Hotung has little interest beyond securing a 'Chinese Republic' though to many within the government, his meddling is an outrage and could lure Zhang away from our grasp. Of course we could demand an explanation from Fengtian directly."
 lechotung.23.a: "Tell Shanghai to keep their noses out of our affairs."
 lechotung.23.b: "This could be useful, give them a greenlight."
 lechotung.23.c: "Demand an explanation from Zhang."
 lechotung.24.t: "The Investigation Goes Ahead"
 lechotung.24.d_west: "Despite fears that the Japanese had been spying on the meeting and would be ready to veto the investigation it appears that they themselves are unaware of Fengtian's monetary aid and will let us operate unhindered. However, there are rumours that pro-Fengtian spies will be lurking in the city so we should act quickly before they can disrupt the investigation. Allegedly, Huang Jinrong may have documents that could speed up the investigation but he would want them at a price..."
 lechotung.24.d_jap: "Tokyo has officially given us the greenlight to go ahead with the investigation though there are rumours that pro-Fengtian spies will be lurking in the city so we should act quickly before they can disrupt the investigation. Allegedly, Huang Jinrong may have documents that could speed up the investigation but he would want them at a price..."
 lechotung.24.a: "We can handle this on our own, thanks."
 lechotung.24.b: "*Sigh* How much?"
 lechotung.25.t: "Shanghai Investigates The Hotung Fund"
 lechotung.25.d: "As Fengtian is the sole and legitimate government of China, it attracts various 'charitable donations' from all over with some coming from Sir Robert Hotung of Hong Kong. As part of a monetary fraud crackdown, the Legation Cities have began to close in on disrupting Hotung's benevolent donations to the cause of the Grand Marshal. There are many Chinese men in Shanghai who would gladly do our dirty work for the right price but to sway them would cost a substantial bribe. Though if Shanghai's investigation bears fruit it could severely damage our finances..."
 lechotung.25.a: "Make some patriotic contributions to some patriotic citizens."
 lechotung.25.b: "We can't spare the funds!"
 lechotung.26.t: "Fengtian Funds Seized"
 lechotung.26.d: "With the investigation into the Fengtian connection finally bearing fruit, investigators seized a ship in port today filled with gold and silver en route to Fengtian. The Grand Marshal will no doubt feel a sting soon as his funds run dry."
 lechotung.26.a: "Now what to do with all this gold..."
 lechotung.27.t: "Federalist Sympathisers In Hong Kong"
 lechotung.27.d: "With the collapse of suitable republican movements in Liangguang and Chen Jiongming's own relocation to the city of Hong Kong, many of his sympathisers have followed him and taken up residence in the city where funds from the Vermillion Society have now been redirected too. These elements actively plot against the mandate, often engaging in terrorism but with some help from the British we can finish off their numbers."
 lechotung.27.a: "Give the Hong Kong club a call."
 lechotung.28.t: "Federalist Sympathisers Raided"
 lechotung.28.d: "In the early hours of this morning, the homes of various sympathisers to the federalist cause in Hong Kong were raided on the grounds of harbouring fugitives, money laundering and weapon smuggling. Many arrests have been made and the Vermillion Society has been struck a bad blow."
 lechotung.28.a: "Great news!"
 lechotung.29.t: "A Fading Sun On Hong Kong"
 lechotung.29.d: "With unprecedented evidence against Robert Hotung and the Vermillion Society at large, many officers in the Volunteer Corps believe the time has come to establish a special body to regulate financial affairs within the Mandate and wash away Vermillion Society sponsored crime. Before any conclusion could be reached, Hotung himself invited all officers involved to his private estate in Hong Kong and has promised to make a 'charitable contribution' to the Mandate if we are to look the other way and allow his actions to go unpunished."
 lechotung.29.a: "We've not come this far just to take a bribe."
 lechotung.29.b: "Well... these are trying times after all..."
 lechotung.30.t: "Vermillion Society Funds Cut"
 lechotung.30.d: "We have just received word from our agents in Shanghai that the Mandate has undertaken a major crackdown against our monetary operations.

 LEC_francis_wogan_festing_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gAugust 28th, 1902, in Dublin, Ireland, United Kingdom§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gGraduated from Sandhurst in 1921. Festing was looking at a promising career in the British Indian Army or at Eastern Command, having served as Aide-de-Camp to John Burnett-Stuart, former General Officer Commanding, Madras District right up until the even of the revolution. Now like most of the British officer corps who lacked a Syndicalist bent he finds himself drifting between the old colonies. Lacking the budget to commission him the Empire elected not have him continue service in any of the extant dominions and thus he has wound up living with old army chums in Shanghai, where there's nobody to tell you to stop wearing the old uniform and a good chance of a stiff gin in the morning."
 LEC_william_ewart_fairbairn_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gFebruary 28th, 1885, in Rickmansworth, England, United Kingdom§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gA former Royal Marine and police officer in one of Shanghai's red light districts, William Ewart Fairbairn is most notable for his frankly frightening collection of scars accumulated from hundreds of street fights in the line of duty and for organising the SMP's specialist anti-riot squad. Known as \"Dangerous Dan\" Fairbairn is a master of boxing, wrestling, savate, jiujutsu, judo and kung fu, which he has used to develop his own style of combat known as Defendu. According to police records he has over 500 confirmed non-training fights both armed and unarmed under his belt, as well as a custom-made bullet-proof vest designed to stop bullets from a 7.63×25mm Mauser. He now spends most of his time encouraging other members of the Volunteer Corps to remember the basics of CQC."

 LEC_reginald_yorke_tyrwhitt_admiral_desc: "§YAdmiral Description\nBorn:§! §gMay 10th, 1870, in Oxford, England, United Kingdom§!\n§YNaval Career:§! §gEnrolled as a cadet on the HMS Britannia in 1883, Sir Reginal Yorke Tyrwhitt rose through the ranks and eventually served during the Weltkrieg as commander of the Harwich Force, the squadron which fired the first shots of the war in 1914. Its most famous action under Tyrwhitt's command was the Cuxhaven raid, where sea-planes played a key role in attacking a German port from the air and escaping with no casualties. Tyrwhitt's only major blemish is his commendation of Captain John Knowles Im Thurn prior to his mismanagement causing the Plymouth Riots in 1925. Holding the position of Commander-in-Chief, China, in 1926 during the Northern Expedition Tyrwhitt is at least partially responsible for the evacuation of British forces to Australia and the subsequent \"protection\" of Hong Kong by the Germans, an act for which he has never quite been forgiven by his fellow Britons."
