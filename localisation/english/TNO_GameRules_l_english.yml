RULE_OPTION_USA_GOLDWATERS_PRESIDENCY_PATH_RANDOM_DESC:0 "One of President Goldwater's primary promises which propelled him to the Presidency was his insistence upon the reform of America's financial institutions. Too much money has been wastefully spent by Big Government, locked away into programs and deposited directly into the hands of corrupt officials. Red tape strangles private commerce while innovation stagnates and opportunity dies. By cutting the graft, simplifying the process, and freeing industry from government overreach, the market can get the kick in the pants it needs.\n\n§YThe only question, then, is how far should the President go?§!"

It will be no easy feat to get through the legislature, but AuH20 is confident he'll find a way, come hell or high water."

Thurston Ballard Morton, the moderate from Kentucky, has gathered a strong force of Congressional conservatives like him to force Goldwater's hand in a more reasonable direction. Regan's aggressiveness will be sidelined in favor of a more easygoing and acceptable policy. Though it may be disappointing to the base, it will certainly help when it comes to Congressional approval."
