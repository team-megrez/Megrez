He turned his head eastwards towards the city of Bamako, growing, accreting all the riches of this land.\n\nHe saw the new roads, packed with people from the other villages. New buildings, stamped in the signage of the American companies. He shook his head. How did it come to this? He saw the soldiers dig into the reservoirs of the earth, diverting it to the plantations.

Some joked and lit up cigarettes, attempting to hide that premonition of guilt.\n\nThe trucks clambered over low hills, the mud trails winding through clearings in the jungle. They passed through checkpoints enclosed by walls of chicken-wire. The spotlights searing through the jungle with its cyclopean gaze. Diallo knew not where he was going. It did not matter.\n\nAs the land flattened and the jungle canopies retreated to far-off corners, plantations appeared. The rubber trees neatly planted, row upon row. Workers ambled about their bases, collecting latex in small buckets. Diallo and his children watched them go by, little by little, until the neat trees and shambling men grew smaller into dots in the horizon. The advancing treeline swallowed all.\n\nThey reached their camp not long after. They stepped off their vehicles and went in a line to their quarters.

Though the arrangement had suited Firestone in the past, the immense growth of the company's assets had meant that this process had become a bottleneck.\n\nThe talks began when DuPont approached the corporate leadership at Firestone. They made a general gesture: if Firestone agrees to their infrastructure deal, DuPont will exclusively buy rubber only from Firestone's plantations, eschewing other competitors in the field. In exchange, DuPont will provide capital for the new highways, train networks, harbours, ports, and ships in tandem with Firestone's own contributions.

Supporting them will not come without consequences, and we are risking quite a lot by backing them.\n\nNaturally, this means we need something in return.

While the Iberian would like to claim this is due to a job finished and well done it was quite the opposite. At least the opposite for one of those points.\n\nThe negotiations were indeed over, but not successful. In frustration, Leclerc and his delegation had called the whole thing off, cursing the Iberians for their stubbornness, and gaining sympathy for Italy's situation several years ago.\n\nIberia's diplomats sit somberly, reflecting on their recent failure. Some indulge in alcohol to drown out the pain, while others throw themselves into more work to make up for it.\n\nToday, Leclerc flies back with his delegation into West Africa. His stomach churning, he and his men look back on the failure with remorseful, yet analytical minds considering what to do next. The plane flew off, leaving Iberia behind, perhaps forever, while its men looked back wistfully on what could have been."

Both the Iberian government and Leclerc's delegation have a vested interest in how their respective possessions in Africa are handled, albeit with some nuance.\n\nBoth sides have remained deadset in their opposition to anticolonial movements. This has made agreeing a fairly simple affair. Iberian diplomats were especially surprised at how fiery the French were given how indirectly they control their territory, yet it makes sense given their recent scuffle with pan-Africanism.\n\nLeClerc admitted that his government would be unable to maintain a direct hold over West Africa if they retake the mainland; they promised to do what they can to keep friendly governments in place so that both the Iberians and Free French can continue to have access to valuable West African Markets.\n\nWhile this is all dandy, the question of colonial claims is a little more tricky. Asking the Free French to relinquish their claims to our colonies would be a win both for the state and future peace between the two nations. Yet, it could also unnecessarily anger the French, and risk them calling off the entire colonial guarantee."

Leclerc has even threatened to abandon the negotiations altogether. If we are to take the Free French delegation at their word, we'll have to move on from this topic if we want these discussions to continue.\n\nHowever, it could just be a bluff. If the Free French government truly wishes to liberate France, we're their best option. This position gives us leverage, and we best not forget this fact.\n\nIn addition to the above, there is simply the reality that the Free French have no practical way of reclaiming the colonies under our control. They're preoccupied with the government occupying the mainland, and after usurping them they'll be bogged down by Reconstruction and resolving their affairs in West Africa. Trying to start a war with us would be a fool's errand.\n\nHowever, if they truly are being honest about withdrawing, then we might be letting a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity walk away. We've already won some concessions, and we can likely win some more if we simply continue on to a new topic."

Thus they now ask for us to promise to grant them quite generous, ergo, expensive loans after their return home. Unsurprisingly, this request has split our own delegation.\n\nOn the one hand, half of the delegation insists that such spending is completely out of budget and would be a waste of money. There are even those that insist that Iberia should look to not strengthen the French too much in order to remain as the stronger half of our relationship.

The devastation of such a conflict would require a wide reconstruction effort that would take significant funds, and with the French's agreement to high interests in their debt payments we have been backed into a corner and been left without an easy way to reject.

The French initially were vehemently opposed to the idea of providing these bases, as they feared risking their hegemony in the region, and they were near ready to walk out. Our initial offer had been simple monetary support, which would not have cut it, as their primary motivation is as always their revanchism.\n\nLuckily, we offered a fair deal. Should they allow our troops into their territory, we will give them ground and air support when it comes time to reclaim France. This sweetened the deal immensely, and after the kinks were worked out, they graciously accepted.\n\nAlthough this is highly beneficial to our military complex and expand our global influence, we have intertwined ourselves further with the Free French war machine, which will almost certainly have a future effect on our politics.

Their fears that our bases would threaten their hegemony over their scrap of West Africa won out against their desire to reclaim the mainland.\n\nLuckily for them, they will still be receiving our support in the Mediterranean, escorting their ships to the shores of the mainland. This seems to have been enough for the Free French, and this will still allow us a measure of diplomatic leverage in the future.

But he kept covertly pinching himself in the vehicle that drove into Paris, expecting that he would wake up in Dakar or Conakry and this would all be a dream. But it was no dream. France was free.\n\nLeclerc did not waste time on sentimentality; work had to be done and the Nation's liberation completed. Convening with the Resistance leadership and the general staff came above all else. As for the speech, though the people had every right to be joyful, it was folly piled upon folly for him to incite them to let their emotions detain them—they needed to know at once what was to come next.\n\n\"People of France!\" After the usual congratulatory words saluting France's efforts, he got down to brass tacks. \"In the near future, the plan is as follows. Reconstruction efforts and the consolidation of the state against German subversion will take the first priority, but elections will take place very promptly.\" People applauded every now and then, and he let them; it was only fair after all given the circumstances.\n\n\"Now I will ask for a minute of silence, and thereafter to intone a prayer for those whose sacrifice made the freedom of France possible.\" When that was done, Leclerc left in some haste; he only had a brief moment of time to do what he was waiting for for over twenty years—to see his wife and children again. He had fallen down on his knees and muttered a prayer when the officer came in with the news that they were safe.\n\nHe saw them in a room of the Hôtel Matignon and ran to embrace them, dropping his usual reserve. It was then that he knew that France was truly free."

OFN은 그에게 미국 대통령이 사용하는 미디어 활용법을 그에게 모방하도록 영감을 주었으며, 그 과정에서 그는 \"프랑스의 케네디\"라는 별명을 얻었습니다. 동시에 확고한 대서양주의자이기도 한 그는 자신만의 비전을 통해 프랑스와 미국을 동등한 파트너라고 주장해 왔습니다.\n\n르카누에는 레지스탕스의 이상을 추종했지만, 동시에 드골의 방식이 지나치게 독재적이라고 비판해 왔습니다. 샤방 델마스처럼 갈리아 주위를 고수하는 대신 르카누에는 경제적 자유주의와 복지 체제가 강화된 시장경제 건설을 주도하고 있습니다. 임무가 어려울지 몰라도, 목표를 위해서라면 실패하거나 주저하지 않을 것입니다."
