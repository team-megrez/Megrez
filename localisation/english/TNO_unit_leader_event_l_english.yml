 unit_leader_events.1.d:0 "In [From.GetHerHis] service to [From.From.GetNameDef], it seems [From.GetRank] [From.GetName] has pushed [From.GetHerselfHimself] too far. As a result of the bad climate in their operational area, the [From.GetRank] has now fallen ill, and will likely need some time to recover. Until [From.GetSheHe] gets well, [From.GetSheHe] will not be performing at [From.GetHerHis] usual level."

 unit_leader_events.2.d:0 "In bringing the battle to a successful conclusion, it seems [From.GetRank] [From.GetName] put [From.GetHerselfHimself] at a bit too much risk while leading [From.GetHerHis] men. [From.GetSheHeCap] has been wounded, and it will likely take some time for the wounds to fully heal, until which time the [From.GetRank] will not be performing at [From.GetHerHis] usual level."

 operative_events.2.desc:0 "While on assignment in [From.From.GetNameDef], [This.GetName] was evidently detected by [From.From.GetAdjective] counter-intelligence. The last message [This.GetSheHe] sent said that [This.GetSheHe] noticed enemy surveillance following [This.GetHerHim] and that [This.GetSheHe] was going to execute evasion and escape procedures.\n\nAs part of these procedures, [This.GetName] will naturally have broken contact with [This.GetHerHis] handlers to avoid compromising them or others.\n\nIf successful, [This.GetName] will contact us again in a few weeks."

 operative_events.3.desc:0 "It appears that [This.GetName], one of our agents deployed in [From.From.GetNameDef], has made the ultimate sacrifice and died in the line of duty. Reports from [From.From.GetAdjective] sources are naturally sparse, but it appears that [This.GetName] was being tracked by [From.From.GetAdjective] counter-intelligence. It seems likely that [This.GetSheHe] was about to be captured and either choose death to avoid giving out vital information under interrogation or was killed by [From.From.GetAdjective] agents while resisting arrest."

 operative_events.6.desc:0 "[This.GetName] has been caught attempting to infiltrate our administration and leak secret information back to [This.GetHerHis] superiors. Upon interrogation, [This.GetSheHe] revealed [This.GetHerselfHimself] to be a foreign asset for [From.GetAgency] operating on [From.From.GetAdjective] soil. It is still yet unknown what the exact nature of [From.GetAdjective] interest in our nation is or what sections of our administration have already been exposed to the eyes of [From.GetAdjective] Intelligence. With [This.GetName] imprisoned and awaiting further interrogation, we can only hope that eventually [This.GetSheHe] will reveal all there is to know of [From.GetAdjective] operations in [From.From.GetNameDef]."
