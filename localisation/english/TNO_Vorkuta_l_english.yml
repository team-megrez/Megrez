 POLITICS_VASILY_BLOKHIN_DESC: "Some men have strict moral codes. Vasily Mikhailovich Blokhin abandoned them long ago, when he became the chief executioner of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, the NKVD. His effectiveness in \"wetwork\" as a Cheka member would not go unnoticed, and so he would quickly gain a higher position. Blokhin's brutality was unmatched: he personally oversaw mass executions of \"enemies of the state\", from the most insignificant ones to those of the most prominent Bolsheviks in the history of the Soviet Union. Thousands would perish under his watch, yet he himself would manage to avoid being affected by any purges carried out.\n\nFollowing the end of the Second World War and the humiliating defeat of the USSR, Blokhin would not let his power go that easily. As chief of the Vorkutlag, a large gulag complex, he would exercise his power, initially as the face of the West Russian Revolutionary Front's authority. In reality, he did whatever he wanted to, and there was no one that could stop him, for they would be executed or mysteriously disappear. However, things would change with the rebellion of the gulag inmates against the guards: the formation of the dissident group of the Ural League put him in danger, but soon he would reign supreme once again as they fled southwards.\n\nVasily Blokhin was left to govern the gulags of Vorkuta, and now the city itself, on his own, especially as the WRRF crumbled with the famous West Russian War. With the help of what few guards remained, he would reorganize the area, and effectively set up his warlord state. However, Blokhin is not an ambitious man; all he wants is for his fiefdom to be left alone and survive, no matter what the cost for that may be."
