 POLITICS_DMYTRO_KLYACHKIVSKY_DESC:0 "Loyalty. Valor. Sacrifice. Values Stepan Bandera deemed necessary for freedom, followed fervently by Dmytro Klyachkivsky. By Bandera's will, he cleansed Galicia and Volyn of the degenerates who tainted Ukraine's soil. When the Vozhd Konovalets succumbed to illness, they rallied the people against the arch-traitor Melnyk, who bowed to the Germans while they pillaged Ukraine.\n\nLoyalty. Valor. Sacrifice. Values that are long lost. Klyachkivsky took up Bandera's mantle to lead the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. The First Struggle was bloody, and many men fell to the wrath of German steel. While the true revolutionaries fought on, the weak-willed deserted. The Second Struggle had succeeded, until the spineless mongrels returned, serving the Reichskommissar for scraps, some even turned to republicanism. The hordes of betrayers had overwhelmed them, and Klyachkivsky would have revenge.\n\nLoyalty. Valor. Sacrifice. Values that must be restored. Ukraine's people languish in chains, shackled by betrayers and their foreign masters. Only true strength can save them, not the decadent liberals, not the socialist Jews, and not the foreign cockroaches. They are a disease that must be cured, a poison whose taint can only be purged through the fires of battle. Ukraine will not be free until Bandera's will is done."
