 POLITICS_MICHAEL_I_DESC:0 "His Majesty Michael I of Romania has been reigning over his kingdom for more than twenty years, but has been ruling it for much less. Placed on the throne when he hadn't even reached the age of 20 by dictator Ion Antonescu and his then allies, the Iron Guard, Michael was supposed to be a puppet King - standing in the shadows as the Conducător amassed victories and fame on the battlefields of World War Two. Impotently witnessing Antonescu's grip on Romania tightening, Michael waited for the right moment to break out of the gilded cage which he had been relegated into by the dictator and his army goons. That moment finally came when Antonescu, in his inflated hubris, decided to reclaim Transylvania from Hungary.\n\nThe war was won, but at a high cost - the Romanian troops faced heavy casualties, resistence in occupied territories remained at critical levels, and the explusion from the Pakt left Romania internationally isolated and soon caused an economic crash. It was at the peak of this crisis that Michael, always the observant and silent type, finally showed his hand. The King ousted an old and senile Antonescu, arresting many of his supporters and instating an emergency government to rid the country of the legacy of the Conducător, with the goal of finally restoring democracy to the country.\n\nSoon, the King's charisma and charme won over much of the population to his side, and with his blessing Romanian society undertook the difficult road of liberalization and democratization after decades under an oppressive, militaristic regime. Despite this, opposition to Michael still exists, albeit mostly hidden to the public eye - among the armed forces, where many are nostalgic of the glory days of the Antonescu era and any mentions of the King is met with murmurs and frowns, and in the deep of the Romanian countryside, where ghosts of a bloody past are said to still roam the forests..."

 ROM_reign_of_the_steel_crown_desc:0 "Mihai I, King of Romania has for a few years been ruling as what is de facto an enlightened despot. Depending on who you ask, the reasons for this are different: according to the King and his partisans, it is only to prepare the country for an eventual democratization down the line; but if you ask the King's enemies, they will tell you that it is because he is a tyrant, who only uses a possible return to democracy to keep power to himself. What is clear, however, is that only Mihai himself knows for sure."

Not the least among them are the remnants of the Iron Guard, hiding in the woods as terrorists or partisans, depending on who you ask. The army is also discontent, which could prove to be a lot of trouble down the line, provided nothing gets done. Yes, Romania is in a difficult place right now, but hopefully things will get better..."

 ROM_ethnic_upheaval_desc:0 "Unlike what some people may think, Romania is a multi-ethnic nation, and even more so after we gained territory following the end of the Second World War. From Ukrainians in Transnistria to Hungarians in Transylvania to Serbs and Germans in Banat, all these minorities have one thing in common: they agitate for either autonomy or independence, which makes them a problem we will have to tackle."
