 SCA_Socialdemocratic_Triumph_desc: "The NSAP successfully secured its place, and came victorious out of the Nordic elections. With them, a unified Nordic welfare state is looming, one that will be a shining example for the rest of the world to follow."
 SCA_Safety_Net: "안보망 설립"
 SCA_Safety_Net_desc: "We should establish a safety net for those unfortunate enough to be unable to work. It is not fitting for a civilised nation such as ours to allow the people to starve to death, rather than to help them."

 SCA_Safeguard_National_Autonomy: "국가 자치 보호장치"
 SCA_Safeguard_National_Autonomy_desc: "We should ensure that we don't fall for the temptation of unnecessary centralisation. Such actions would only harm the popularity of the federation and keep it from improving the lives of its citizens. Local autonomy is therefore paramount."

 SCA_Solidify_Federal_Unity: "연방 단일화 강화"
 SCA_Solidify_Federal_Unity_desc: "We should encourage the consolidation of the federal identity, ensuring that Nordic citizens shall view themselves as just that rather than as Danes, Norwegians and Swedes primarily."

 SCA_Merge_the_National_Armies: "국군 통합"
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Armies_desc: "It is highly inefficient to maintain three separate armies for one federation, despite the close cooperation. We should merge them all into a single army with a single command structure."

 SCA_Modern_Equipment_desc: "Important to minimise our losses and to maximise our army's fighting capacity is to invest in modern equipment for our army. We cannot allow ourselves to fall behind in this area."
 SCA_Maintain_Separate_Militaries: "개별군대 유지"
 SCA_Maintain_Separate_Militaries_desc: "While purely from the perspective of efficiency, a single merged army is best, it will be significantly easier to motivate the people's of our federation to fight under their own flag under that of the federation, where they may be subject to language differences as well."
 SCA_Priors_Grand_Battleplan: "프리어의 대전략"
 SCA_Priors_Grand_Battleplan_desc: "Danish senior officer William Prior has given his own pitch in favour of a very plan-based doctrinal plan for the coming years. According to him, by planning out the next war, we shall win it."
 SCA_Supreme_High_Command: "최고사령부"

 SCA_Merge_the_National_Navies: "국가 해군 통합"
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Navies_desc: "Reality is that the navies of our member states are simply too small to be meaningful in the grand scale of things, but together the navies make for a decently-sized single navy. If we are to reap the benefits of this however, we are to merge these navies under a single command structure."
 SCA_Atlantic_Blue_Water: "대서양 중점: 푸른 물의 해군"
 SCA_Atlantic_Blue_Water_desc: "The primary aim of our navy is to give our federation influence on the grander theatre. A significant presence in the Atlantic is an objective towards reaching that goal. We should focus on making our navy ocean-worthy."
 SCA_Develop_Cruisers: "순양함 개발"
 SCA_Develop_Cruisers_desc: "If we are to secure a presence in the Atlantic west of Norway and Denmark, we should invest in extending our cruiser arsenal. Without them, we are bound to find ourselves unable to exert the power we are desiring."

 SCA_Baltic_Green_Water_desc: "While a hope of exerting our influence into the Atlantic, is hopeful, for the next couple of decades our focus should be on the Baltic sea. With all our navies combined, we can become a significant player in this body of water."
 SCA_Destroyer_Development: "구축함 개발"
 SCA_Destroyer_Development_desc: "We should develop destroyers. These relatively small naval vessels are crucial in defending our larger ships and convoys from the submarine dangers that remain significant to this day."
 SCA_Uboat_Tactics: "유보트 전술"
 SCA_Uboat_Tactics_desc: "The U-Boat made a significant dent in the British navy, especially in the earlier portion of the Weltkrieg. In addition, they are relatively cheap to produce. We should invest in this technology; it will win the next naval war."

 SCA_Merge_the_National_Airforces: "Merge the National Air Forces"
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Airforces_desc: "Our regional air forces are not sufficient to defend the airspaces from a large power. However, if combined, the force grows exponentially and we will become a force in aerial warfare to be reckoned with."

 SCA_Scandinavian_Highway_desc: "We should work on building a highway that connects the far reaches of our federation with each other, increasing the amount of people interacting and mending cultural differences as a result. After all, if it is easy to go to Sweden, why stay only in Norway?"
 SCA_Plan_a_Bridge_over_the_Belt: "벨트교 설계"
 SCA_Plan_a_Bridge_over_the_Belt_desc: "The other side of the coin is bridging the rest of the belt. While it all is part of our Danish member state making the cultural isolation a bit less intense comparatively, it would still be economically very beneficial to bridge the bodies of water. At current however, this too would still take decades."
 SCA_Stockholm_Berlin_by_Train: "열차로 스톡홀름에서 베를린까지?"
 SCA_Stockholm_Berlin_by_Train_desc: "If the aforementioned bridges were constructed, this would allow us to connect Scandinavia to the train net of mainland Europe, without the need to go through Russia. It would be a massive boon, but even before the bridges become technically realistic we can establish a different system with the ferries."
 SCA_Unified_Schooling_System: "학교교육체계 통일"
 SCA_Unified_Schooling_System_desc: "By unifying the differing schooling systems of our member states into a single system, we can increase interaction between schools from different states. Norwegians will then have an educational development that will be recognisable for Swedes, bringing about a greater similarity in the next generation."
 SCA_Mandatory_Language_Classes: "의무 언어교육 이수"
 SCA_Mandatory_Language_Classes_desc: "The difference - be they sometimes subtle - between the Nordic languages can result in nasty communication errors.

In Sweden, the traditional conservatives have joined this party, although some among them look with a certain suspicion to the limited commitment to some of the values of conservatism embraced in this new party, despite the name.
