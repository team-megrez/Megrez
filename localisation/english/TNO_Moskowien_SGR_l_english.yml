 MCW_The_Marshals_Fiefdom_desc:0 "페르디난드 쇠르너 원수와 그의 급진적인 군국주의 집단이 모스크바에서 권력을 장악하면서 잔혹한 군사 독재 정권을 수립했습니다. 그는 제국의 정복자들을 인간 이하 노예들의 반란으로부터 구하고 있다고 주장하지만, 실제로 쇠르너는 눈 덮인 영토를 자신의 개인적인 영지로 바꾸어 놓았습니다."
 MCW_Brutal_Repression:0 "잔인한 탄압"
 MCW_Brutal_Repression_desc:0 "As well as dedicating himself to annihilating the Slave Revolt in Moskowien, the Marshal has sworn to crack down on any dissenters who dare to oppose his regime. Rebellious politicians, Wehrmacht officers, German settlers and Russian natives alike are being executed en masse by his roving squads of loyal militarists, and no one knows if the brutal oppression will die down - or has only just begun."
 MCW_Schorners_Ambition:0 "쇠르너의 야망"
 MCW_Schorners_Ambition_desc:0 "Ruling as the Marshal of Moskowien is just the first step on the bloody road to total domination of the Großgermanisches Reich. Schörner's eyes are cast towards the west, hoping that the chaos of the Slave Revolt will aptly set the stage for a triumphant march towards Germania and the downfall of Albert Speer himself."
 MCW_Schorners_Ambition_tooltip:0 "§RIf not dealt with quickly enough, Schörner may act on his ambition and cross the Dnieper...§!"
 MCW_Russia_in_ruins:0 "폐허가 된 러시아"
 MCW_Russia_in_ruins_desc:0 "The Slave Revolt has been nothing but disastrous for Moskowien, adding unto the disastrous state of the territory. Due to Schörner's brutal repression of protestors and innocents alike, as well as the heavy fighting that occurred during Fall Otto, the troubled territory is close to bursting. Status quo occupation by the Reich seems more impossible by the day."
 MCW_Pakt_Commission:0 "Hoher Ausschuss des Einheitspakts für Russland"
 MCW_Pakt_Commission_desc:0 "As a consequence of Moskowien's situation following the Slave Revolt and as a gesture of solidarity, Moskowien has officially been relegated into a joint occupation commission by the Einheitspakt. Despite this gesture, it is still the Greater German Reich directing occupation policy, and it will be the government in Germania which decides Moskowien's fate."

 POLITICS_FERDINAND_SCHORNER_MOSKOWIEN_DESC:0 "Ferdinand Schörner is not a man who takes insults lightly. Since his exile to Moskowien under false pretenses, the Feldmarschall has bitterly done his duty, ruling his troops with an iron fist and showing no mercy to partisan forces. All the while, he and his militarist clique have ground their teeth and glared towards Germania, waiting for the perfect opportunity to seek their revenge.\n\nWhatever he was waiting for, Schörner could never have predicted the Slave Revolt. With the chaos brought forth by Russian slaves rising up against their masters throughout Militärbezirk Russland, Schörner has brutally seized power and established a new military government. Reports of his brutality against these uprisings have spread far and wide, and his treasonous threats to march towards Germania in order to annihilate the Revolt have not fallen on deaf ears.\n\nWhile the legitimacy of his threats are a matter of debate, only a fool would believe that Ferdinand Schörner's ambitions end with his autocracy over Russia."
