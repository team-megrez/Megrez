 xin.3.desc: "Dzungaria, mostly occupied by both Kazakhs and Mongols has been a trouble spot for Yang's administration since its emergence, serving as a hot spot of mainly Mongolian bandits to launch raids against our people. Despite being silent for the past year, troubles within Western Mongolia under Ungern's regime has spread to Xinjiang, as these bandits have reemerged once again. We'll need to wait for Yang's response on the issue to deal with the problem, but until then they will be troublesome."
 xin.3.a: "이런 문제는 결코 끝나지 않지?"
 xin.4.t: "양쩡신의 침묵"
 xin.4.desc: "In a surprise to everyone but his closest advisors, Yang's response to this appearance has been limited at best. His paranoia of assassination has made him just stay inside his home, telling his officials \"Bah, these Mongols were hardly trouble before, I doubt they'll be of much trouble now! The problem will take care of itself!\" Despite this response, Jin Shuren, Yang Zengxin's top advisor, has begun to mobilise a force to the north in order to deal with the disturbance."
 xin.4.a: "터무니 없군..."
 xin.5.t: "연맹의 붕괴"
 xin.5.desc: "The news of the collapse of the Zhili hegemony in the south, the League of Eight Provinces, have just reached our ears. Despite the shock, Xinjiang's relative isolation from the rest of China has left the ripples reaching us being limited. Yang Zengxin's paranoia could be cause for concern however, he very likely feels his current position within the governorship is in danger."
 xin.5.a: "상황을 주시하라"
 xin.6.t: "침묵"
 xin.6.desc: "Silence is all that has been heard for almost a month now. People only come to Yang's chamber when they have something to report, and this past month has been uneventful besides Jin Shuren's army being almost ready to crush the northern bandits. Even then, many are suspicious on the lack of response from Yang at all and no orders seemingly being sent at all. Jin Shuren has decided to temporarily pause the raising of his army in order to investigate the situation before he heads out on a month long expedition to make sure his superior is alright."
 xin.6.a: "우리의 두려움은 확실한 근거가 없다."
 xin.7.t: "실종"
 xin.7.desc: "In a shock to many, Yang is simply gone. The entire premises has been searched high and low for any sign of Yang being here for the past couple of days, but there's none. In fact, most of his possessions he has collected over the years seem to be missing as well. Jin is continuing to search the area for any signs of where Yang could have gone, but the chances of Yang even being in Dihua at this point is unlikely, leaving Jin and other retainers in a worrisome position. It could take months to receive a message from the Qing on who the new governor is, leaving the most important spot in Xinjiang completely vacant in the mean time."
 xin.7.a: "협업이 질서를 유지하는 열쇠이다."
 xin.8.t: "강도질"
 xin.8.desc: "As the home of Yang Zengxin continues to be searched, Jin himself has checked on the treasury of Xinjiang, supposedly filled with a fortune of taxes gained from the populace of Xinjiang. As Jin and his guards arrived, they opened the door...\n\nAnd all the money was gone.\n\nAn absolute fortune amassed over the period of twenty years has disappeared along with Yang Zengxin, leaving many theories as to exactly what has happened here. The most believed so far is Yang Zengxin simply... left. Yang has left with all of our money, possessions, and with his title of governor still intact."
 xin.8.a: "..."
 xin.9.t: "쿠데타"
 xin.9.desc: "As the situation began to hit Jin Shuren during the investigation, he's realised the position he is in. There will be no new governor for months at least along with no Yang Zengxin, and he is the most prominent government official left within Dihua currently. He needed to make his move before anyone else arrived, using his recently made army that was supposed to crush the Mongol bandits.\n\nAnd as expected, he did. Jin Shuren with his 3,000 troops have stormed the capital and secured it completely, declaring himself governor of Xinjiang before a proper response from the Qing could even be formulated. Not all are pleased by these events, especially the Dao-yin of Aksu, Fan Yaonan, leading many to believe that crisis could be on its way to Xinjiang for the first time in 20 long years. Not only that, but it's not even known what the Qing will think about this turn of events, leaving Jin with absolute power over the entirety of Xinjiang until news is heard."
 xin.9.a: "We have to believe in Jin."
 xin.10.t: "초대"
 xin.10.desc: "With the everyday proceedings of Xinjiang continuing as normal, Jin Shuren has finally left for his expedition to crush the recently emerged Mongol bandits. All is well within Xinjiang, while the rest of China has erupted into chaos as a result of the League of Eight Provinces' collapse. In almost a celebration of the circumstances, the Dao-yin of Aksu and foreign minister of Xinjiang, Fan Yaonan, has announced a party, inviting many government officials, including Yang Zengxin. Yang's isolation has led most to expect him to decline this, but perhaps Yang could make use of a day of luxury with the recent stresses of governing?"
 xin.10.a: "연회를 즐길 시간이군!"
 xin.10.b: "I've never trusted Fan before and certainly will not now."
 xin.11.t: "연회"
 xin.11.desc: "The night was lively as Yang Zengxin entered Aksu today, seeing mass amounts of food and drink for the night, ready to spend this night to the fullest as if it will be his last. He sits down an hour later, ready to finally begin. He digs into his food as Fan Yaonan and a multitude of other governmental officials join him in the luxuries of life. Fan excuses himself from the table with Yang barely noticing, still indulging his gluttony. Fan Yaonan returned ten minutes later, with two guards with guns and red arm bands in tow behind him as he sits down again.\n\n\"A toast, to Yang's continued health!\"\n\nYang raised his glass as well, a smile on his face until he realised what was happening. The guards now pointed their guns as Yang, and shots immediately rang out in the banquet, and soon there was a dead, soiled, and decrepit Yang Zengxin lying on the ground with bullet holes in his head and chest."

 xin.12.t: "진수런의 진격"
 xin.12.desc: "Jin Shuren wasted no time in heading back to Aksu after hearing of his former superior's death, with his recently raised force in tow. Fan Yaonan is seemingly completely unprepared for this, with his efforts to raise his own force to defend Aksu completely failing as the city descends into anarchy. He, his officials, and his small force of 200 hole up in Aksu, waiting for when Jin Shuren's horde arrives."
 xin.12.a: "His prospects look dim."
 xin.13.t: "두 번째 정권탈취"
 xin.13.desc: "Jin secured Dihua and quickly moved onto Aksu, where Fan Yaonan waited, desperately trying to set up as many defences as he could before Jin would arrive. It was pointless, as when Jin arrived, soon after his securing of Dihua, his massive army rushed into the city and secured it all, eventually breaking through into Fan's residence, with Fan nowhere to be found. Before the Qing even knew their loyal governor Yang was gone, two coups have taken place in Xinjiang. Now Jin Shuren has installed himself as governor, and there is little Beijing can do about it."
 xin.13.a: "I'll pass on the banquet this time."
 xin.14.t: "양쩡신의 죽음"
 xin.14.desc: "As Yang Zengxin's various officials went to visit him today before the expedition to crush the Mongol threat to the north, they were shocked at what they found. Yang Zengxin seemed to have died in his sleep at an unknown time, leaving open many questions as to what is going to happen next. Many predict Jin Shuren's ascendancy to the governor position by force before the Qing can react to the situation using his new army, but as of yet nothing has occurred. All that can be done is wait and see how the situation unfolds."
 xin.14.a: "어떻게 우리에게 이런 일이 일어나는 건가?"
 xin.15.t: "진수런이 디화를 제압하다"
 xin.15.desc: "As many predicted, Jin Shuren has decided to make his move on Dihua and secure it using his newly armed force. The streets are filled with soldiers as any possible political dissidents are being removed one by one. Among these is the Dao-yin of Aksu, Fan Yaonan who has a somewhat petty rivalry with Jin. Little is known about what Jin's next moves will be, but many predict that Fan Yaonan's position of power will not be lasting for much longer."
 xin.15.a: "우리는 그의 손에 놀아났군..."
 xin.16.t: "아커쑤로 진격하는 진수런"
 xin.16.desc: "As many predicted, Jin quickly moved from Dihua to remove Fan Yaonan's position in power before he could even act. Many noticed what looks like the beginning of a build-up of defences, but Fan's accomplices were killed before any meaningful resistance could be put up, though Fan himself could not be found. Some believe him to have escaped into the mountains to avoid capture. Ma Shaowu, the Dao-yin of Hotan has declared his loyalty to the new governor Jin Shuren, aiming to secure his rule in the south. Jin Shuren has agreed to this, finally achieving his rule over all of Xinjiang, at least for now."
 xin.16.a: "지금 이러한 것들은 우리 신강이 필요로 했던 것들이다!"
 xin.17.t: "진수런의 권력 규합"
 xin.17.desc: "With Ma Shaowu's southern government declaring loyalty to the new governor Jin Shuren, Jin has managed to secure all aspects of power. Fan Yaonan is missing, and with the cabinet slowly being replaced one by one, Jin is surely the ruler who has proven himself to be on top during this time of stress. No one knows what he has planned but based off his close proximity with Yang Zengxin, it most likely will be similar in policy. One piece still missing to the puzzle is the empty seat of the Dao-yin of Aksu, but surely someone will be appointed soon."
 xin.17.a: "To a new future."
 xin.19.t: "위구르인에 대한 2배의 세금"
 xin.19.desc: "With Jin as de facto governor, he's immediately putting in new policies regarding the Muslim population in Xinjiang. With these, the tax on Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Central Asian peoples is being doubled immediately. This is seen as completely ignoring Yang Zengxin's policy of treading carefully with the populace to avoid revolt, resulting in many seeing this as an overall risky move. But as long as the money keeps coming to us, what's the possible harm?"
 xin.19.a: "우리를 돈방석에 올려 놓겠지!"

The more conservative southern people have long been the hotbed for unorganised uprisings and rebellions which Shaowu has done well to contain so far through the use of police and overall suppression of information.

While this could mean the further division of the deeply divided Xinjiang, it is preferable to the bastard Fan Yaonan or the possibility of falling to the Turks.

Jin has declared the negotiations fruitless, and suggests sending troops to take him out and put someone else in charge of the army.

However, when he bashed through the door, all he found was an empty bed and an open window. Shahidi realised his mistake of not leaving more soldiers outside to guard the perimeter, as Sabit Damulla slipped through his grasp. Within the hour hundreds of Sabits troops got to the house, but by then Shahidi and his men had gone.\n\nThough the assassination was a failure, it will still have dire consequences. Sabit Damulla, paranoid for his life, has gone into hiding, leaving it very difficult to communicate with him. Divisions are left disorganised and are even sometimes turning against each other."

 xinfd.17.d: "Burhan Shahidi has returned, having failed his mission. He recounts a story of how his men charged down a hill towards Sabit Damulla's house, killing multiple guards on their way down. He talks of how he himself kicked down the front door and shot multiple guards with his pistol. However, by the time he got to Sabit's bedroom, he had escaped.\n\nThough Shahidi failed in his mission, this is not a total loss. Our spies in Hotan and Kashgar have told us that Sabit Damulla has gone into hiding, completely isolating himself from most other people. This has led to complete disorganisation in the East Turkestan forces."

 xin.110.desc: "Following the disappearance of Xinjiang's sage governor Yang Zengxin, reporters have flocked to Mengzi in Yunnan to get the scoop from his hometown. The townspeople of Mengzi remarked that Yang's family is still well off, and are refusing to give hints as to where Yang would have gone. Most reporters came to the conclusion that Yang had returned to his military post in Gansu, and ended their investigation there. The intrepid few with connections in Gansu, however, have reported that Yang has not been seen in Gansu, but traces of his gold bullion have shown up in the hands of trade merchants in Yunnan. Although there is no solid proof as of yet, it appears that Yang could either have been robbed or is living incognito."

 xin.111.d: "It seems like the Western Gate between China and Central Asia has broken down into violence once again. Governor [SIK.GetLeader] 's recent dispute with Kumul has resulted in a large contingent of volunteer soldiers rising up against the army garrison. Rumours say that the Turks to the far west are also preparing to defy the Governor once again.\n\nThe Governor of Xinjiang, should he remain chinese, represents a potential ally to the southern Democratic cliques. The Kumuliliks, however, seem to vary greatly in between respect for Beijing to restless xenophobia. The Eastern Turks doubtlessly would separate from China entirely should they win."

 SIK_purging_suspicion_desc: "The civil servants of Xinjiang must be jaded at this point by the cycle of coups in their offices. Suspicion is not something the Governor can erase easily, but a good step towards creating a permanent government in Xinjiang is a mass promotion of those civil servants that did not steal from their office or engage in graft."

 SIK_establish_neutrality: "중립성 확인"
 SIK_establish_neutrality_desc: "Governor Sheng is extremely wary of committing to a national conflict. Sending Xinjiang's soldiers abroad could invite dissidents at home to revolt once again.

 SIK_seven_point_manifesto_desc: "After compiling a set of programmes from Southern China, including Sun-Yat Sen's Principles, Karl Marx's Capital, and Chen's Federalist declaration, Sheng has formulated a Seven Point Manifesto to reform Xinjiang towards true democracy with regards to the limitations of war time."
 SIK_equality_of_races: "출발선 공정"
 SIK_equality_of_races_desc: "One of Sheng's Seven Points is to end racial segregation in Xinjiang.

 SIK_kazakh_exodus: "카자흐 대탈출"

 SIK_filling_government_desc: "When the cities of Xinjiang crumbled, the civil servants of Xinjiang were scattered.

 SIK_positions_for_uyghurs_desc: "Although separate, Uyghurs in Xinjiang did play a valuable role in defending Dihua. Governor Sheng feels that the tide of public opinion is slowly turning against Jadidists, and a reward to loyal officers like Burhan Shahidi is in order."
 SIK_the_purge: "숙청"
 SIK_the_purge_desc: "It has come to the Governor's attention that there are inconsolable issues between the Uyghur and Hui people in Xinjiang. This is manifested in not only the rivalry between Jahriyya and Jadidist, but in a reinforcement of Chinese language as a shibboleth. Another, more organised purge may be necessary to solve this."
 SIK_kuomintangs_xinjiang: "신강의 국민당"
 SIK_kuomintangs_xinjiang_desc: "The Kuomintang has interested Sheng Shicai for decades, going back to his early days in Manchuria. Having taken a position against direct intervention if unnecessary, Governor Sheng has chosen to aid the KMT through donations from the state treasury."
 SIK_education_reform: "교육 개혁"
 SIK_education_reform_desc: "The madrasa in Kashgar, when Sheng shut it down, created a gap in education for the city. Like so many other towns in Xinjiang, formal education has been replaced with religious education by obvious Ottoman infiltrators. True education for Xinjiang must be secular, focused on science, and be open to both girls and boys."
 SIK_modernist_schools: "현대적인 학교"

 SIK_local_teachers: "지역의 선생들"

 SIK_cultural_promotion_socities: "사회문화진흥"
 SIK_cultural_promotion_socities_desc: "The people of Xinjiang suffer from the Imperialist mindset. Instead of working towards cooperation, it is evident to Governor Sheng that the Uyghur and Hui people will need to be supported within the Han system of the Kuomintang. This can be achieved through Cultural Promotion Societies."
 SIK_curbing_addiction: "중독 발생"
 SIK_curbing_addiction_desc: "The garrisons of Xinjiang suffered under Yang Zengxin's leadership, especially with regards to discipline.

 SIK_expand_tungan_recruitment: "동간족 징집 확대"
 SIK_expand_tungan_recruitment_desc: "The Tungan people are neglected by the Western Gate, and are suffering more than most in Western China. This makes the Tungan people ideal recruits for the Xinjiang military, which can elevate and allow young men to escape poverty in their home town."
 SIK_uyghur_militia: "위구르 민병대"
 SIK_uyghur_militia_desc: "The Uyghur people suffer greatly during this time of disunity, and their young men wander aimlessly for a purpose. In order to ensure they do not fall under into the clutches of the Jadidists, we must make the effort to recruit them into a militia. The militia will be a safeguard against anti Han agitation, even if it is never strong enough to be used."
 SIK_proper_training: "적절한 훈련"
 SIK_proper_training_desc: "The Governor has ordered new training manuals from Baoding to be shipped to his office, convinced that new developments in military schools outmode current training. Should these manuals win over the general staff, our garrisons are to be trained in the new drills immediately."
 SIK_expand_arms_industry: "군수산업 확장"
 SIK_expand_arms_industry_desc: "The arms industry in Xinjiang has long depended on outdated weapons from the east being sold to us at inflated prices. The Governor wishes to ensure that future conflict will not be derailed by defective weaponry, thus he is authorising the hiring of more machinists."
 SIK_expand_military_academy: "카슈가르 중국인 학교 확장"
 SIK_expand_military_academy_desc: "Kashgar, in the wake of the madrasa's closing, lacks any form of reliable education. Education is seen by the Governor not only as a tool for economic growth, but for increasing his influence on the young men of Xinjiang. A Chinese school in Kashgar will achieve both goals."
 SIK_raid_nationalist_camps: "민족주의자 은신처 급습"
 SIK_raid_nationalist_camps_desc: "Nationalist camps on the border of Xinjiang have taken advantage of the fertile land in recent years to set up farms.

If we were to exercise our right to disperse these camps, their opium farms would be ours."
 SIK_russian_technology: "러시아식 전술"
 SIK_russian_technology_desc: "The Russian delegation in Xinjiang has whittled down to a single unpaid diplomat, whom is seriously considering retirement.

 SIK_foreign_assistance: "외국 원조"
 SIK_foreign_assistance_desc: "The current state of the Xinjiang foreign office is lamentable. Where just two decades ago Russian diplomats, Ambans, and British explorers gladly filed in to inform the Governor, now most avoid it for fear of being extorted by the few remaining bureaucrats. The Governor has authorised the hiring of more bureaucrats to reform the office."
 SIK_russian_sector: "러시아와의 연줄"
 SIK_russian_sector_desc: "Diplomatic relations with Russia were not kept up under Governor Yang Zengxin, and our remaining influence on Russia comes in the form of land grants to speculators. The Governor has compiled a list of land grants to entice Russians to immigrate to Xinjiang, and indirectly make our safety a greater concern for Russia as a whole."
 SIK_russian_investment: "러시아의 투자"
 SIK_russian_investment_desc: "It is reported that in Kazan there are fraudulent claims in Xinjiang for sale. It is the opinion of the Governor that, in order to bring legitimacy to his office and entice Russian investment, some of these land grants should be honoured. So long as they are for land we haven't already sold."
 SIK_industrial_expansion: "산업 확장"
 SIK_industrial_expansion_desc: "The vast flow of unemployed workers into Xinjiang is an opportunity for us to expand the provincial armoury.

 SIK_mineral_expedition: "광산 확장"
 SIK_mineral_expedition_desc: "There are rumours that a massive oil deposit exists in Dunshanzi. It is well worth the cost for the Governor to send engineers out to Dunshanzi and assess the value of the land. We can hopefully recoup the cost by producing valuable land grants."
 SIK_south: "남쪽 연결"
 SIK_south_desc: "Tunganistan has suffered under the decades of neglect under Yang Zengxin's regime. Now the multitudes of requests to fix the road from Kashgar to Khotan can be granted, and the people there to benefit from our administration."
 SIK_expanding_dihua: "다화의 역량강화"
 SIK_expanding_dihua_desc: "The battlements around Dihua have left a lot of land cleared of vegetation. This fallow land cannot be used for farming yet, but with the proper direction the land can be flattened for modern machine factories."
 SIK_dihua_fortification: "디화 요새화"
 SIK_dihua_fortification_desc: "The walls of Dihua are covered in torn propaganda. These words cannot defend against determined rebels any more. The Governor has authorised additional fortifications to be built around Dihua to add power to our new propaganda we write on the walls."
 SIK_settling_dzungaria_tribes: "중가리아 부족민 정착"
 SIK_settling_dzungaria_tribes_desc: "The tribes of Dzungaria have been unable to reap the benefits from the good harvests of 1936. Their town leaders have requested permission to resettle south, something the Governor does not want, but lacks the force to deny."
 SIK_northern_gold: "북쪽의 확금"
 SIK_northern_gold_desc: "The rumours of gold in western Xinjiang have made their way into fraudulent land grants you can find throughout western China. It is obvious to the Governor that an official expedition to the reported sources of gold must be made. The potential wealth, if proven true, will more than pay for the trip."
 SIK_khotan_carpet_factory: "호탄 양탄자 공장 확장"
 SIK_khotan_carpet_factory_desc: "Khotan is famed for their hardy wool carpets, to the point where you can find markets in Afghanistan and India passing them off as ours. It may behove the Governor to invest in a large scale carpet factory in Khotan, if only for the ability to manipulate the market and increase their value."
 SIK_kashgar_investment: "카슈가르 투자"
 SIK_kashgar_investment_desc: "The destruction wrought in Kashgar must be answered with concern. The Governor has authorised funding to go into repairing and building small scale industry in Kahsgar."
 SIK_navigating_desert: "타클라마칸 개척"
 SIK_navigating_desert_desc: "The Taklamakan basin is a death trap for travellers, and for decades has been circumvented by the road to Kumul. With the latest insurgency seeing armies cross the basin to ambush us, it is worth it to consider setting up small outposts in the basin to allow us to navigate it in an emergency."
 SIK_open_mineral_mining: "광산 개업"

After graduation, Fan served as a teacher at the Xinjiang Law School until his appointment as a judicial director. That year, the court was abolished and Fan travelled to Beijing to serve under the Beiyang Government. Passed up for the position of Dao-Yin of Dihua, Fan was appointed Dao-Yin of the more impoverished Aksu. Furthering his education, Fan learned Russian at the Xinjiang Russian Law School, and made efforts to promote cohesion between the newly arrived Russian immigrants to Aksu. In 1920, Governor Yang Zengxin appointed Fan as Xinjiang's representative to Russia, wherein Fan negotiated a deal to end Russian tariffs to Xinjiang until 1940. Fan Yaonan is know for his humbleness and quiet opposition to Governor Yang Zengxin's over-taxation of Aksu."
 SIK_ma_shaowu_leader_desc: "Ma Shaowu's reputation was already coloured by the exploits of his Sufi relative, Ma Yuanzhang, who had worked against Yang Zengxin's government and the Hanafi Hui warlord Ma Fuxiang. Ma Shaowu nonetheless spent his early years in the employ of the Qing and Yang Zengxin. Yang Zengxin was impressed by Ma Shaowu's loyalty, and appointed him to dispose of the warlord Ma Fuxing in 1924. Ma Shaowu was given the Dao-Yin of Hotan as a reward. Ma Shaowu's policy as Dao-Yin leaned more towards opposing aggressive Russian immigration, and held Uyghurs and Mongolian residents in low regard. Following an assassination attempt by a Kirghiz turk, Ma Shaowu sought treatment for his broken legs in Russia, Ma Shaowu told his story to travelling journalist Peter Fleming, who commented on the resilience of the old man, as well as his ascetic lifestyle."
 SIK_sheng_shicai_leader_desc: "Sheng was born to an enterprising but poor family in Manchuria, which paid for him to attend the Provincial Forestry and Agricultural School in Shenyang. Sheng went on to Waseda University in 1917, where he was introduced to a mixture of Sun Yat-sen rhetoric and the book 'ABCs of Socialism'. Sheng described himself as a Marxist upon his return in 1920, and decided to enter the military service. First fighting under Zhang Zuolin in 1924, Sheng became incensed at the anti-intellectual policies Zhang espoused, and left for Japan once again to receive more military training. Upon the failure of the Northern Expedition, Sheng returned to China and joined the Guominjun under Feng Yuxiang in 1928. Following the destruction of Gansu, Sheng took a job offer from Fan Yaonan to lead the Aksu Garrison. Sheng became aware of Jin Shuren's foray into underground politics in 1935, and chose not to alert Yang Zengxin, due to his latent Marxist ideals against Yang's despotism."
 SIK_jin_shuren_leader_desc: "Jin Shuren's career began in Gansu, where he served as the principle of the Qing-aligned Gansu Normal School. Jin used this position to pass the Imperial Civil Service Examinations, which got Jin the attention of Yang Zengxin. When Yang was appointed Governor of Xinjiang in 1908, Jin became his district magistrate. The ensuing years of revolution depleted Yang's administrative staff, pushing Jin higher until he was appointed Commissioner of Civil Affairs in Urmuqi in 1927. Jin began to use his position as Commissioner to curry favour with several of the propagandising movements coming from Southern China. The underground KMT movement and nascent Federalist movements regarded Jin as a model Han bureaucrat serving what they regard as undeserving provincials."
 SIK_burhan_shahidi_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gOctober 3rd, 1894, in Kazan Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gBurhan Shahidi was born in 1894 in the Russian Kazan Governorate to a family whose ancestors had fled from Aksu after a failed peasant uprising during the Qing dynasty. His family was poor and he received little schooling in his early years. In 1912, after the Xinhai Revolution, Burhan accompanied Tatar merchants to Dihua in Xinjiang and worked as an apprentice and store-clerk. In 1914, Burhan was able to apply and receive Chinese citizenship from the Republic of China on account of his family's ancestry. He spoke Uyghur, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Turkish and some Arabic and acted as the interpreter for Xinjiang Governor Yang Zengxin. Burhan's relations to the Turkic community soured as a result of working under Yang Zengxin, and fellow Uyghurs began to ostracise Burhan. Burhan's meagre position in Yang's administration meant he was unable to mend this distrust, and the Uyghur community's drift towards rebellion alienated Burhan further. Ultimately Burhan choose to attend courses at Baoding Army School starting in 1929, allowing him to be hired by Yang as both an administrator and officer. Upon Burhan's return to Xinjiang in 1934, he found the administration in decline, and unable to correct the widening gap between the Uyghur community and has resigned himself to being an effective public servant under what he considers the best possible administration to industrialise Xinjiang."

 SIK_country_intro_header: "Introduction to the Xinjiang Clique"
 SIK_country_intro_content: "The Xinjiang province of China has had a disruptive history like much of the northwest, as the region has been constantly plagued with whispers of unrest to this day. The Xinhai Revolution spawned yet more of the already used to chaos caused by the local Uyghur population, being more Central Asian then Chinese. The present governor Yuan Du-Hua failed to keep the situation under control, fleeing the province and leaving it in the hands of his trusted advisor Yang Zengxin.\n\nYang through shrewd dealings and violent repression has kept Xinjiang 'stable' for his 20 years of governorship. Yang himself is a very paranoid man, taking all possible precautions to prevent uprisings while still repressing the Uyghurs located within Xinjiang to no end. By '36, he is a secluded soul staying within his house and rarely coming outside due to fear of political assassination by one of his few retainers left. Most duties are handled between his three most powerful advisors Jin Shuren, the Dao-yin of Hotan Ma Shaowu, and the Dao-yin of Aksu and foreign minister Fan Yaonan. Together these three handle most of the everyday administration of Xinjiang while taking orders from Yang himself on occasions. For now, the status quo within Xinjiang is kept but with Yang's seclusion getting worse and worse, anything could happen."
 SIK_country_intro_header_1: "신강과 쿠물 칸국"
 SIK_country_intro_content_1: "The Kumul Khanate is officially a protectorate of the Qing within Xinjiang, and is a largely stabilising factor for Xinjiang itself. Currently ruled by Nasīr Shah, the khanate does very little in the day to day rule of Xinjiang, besides having to pay tribute to the Xinjiang governorship yearly. Why does it matter? Many see the Kumul Khanate's current autonomy as the only thing keeping tensions within Xinjiang from exploding, as it shows a degree of Uyghur rule within the province even if people don't like the current ruler Nasīr. Its existence is key to our peace in the northwest, and only an absolute fool would even dare to try and mess with its presence."
 SIK_country_intro_header_2: "The People of Xinjiang"
 SIK_country_intro_content_2: "The people of Xinjiang are by far the most unique in China, as many would argue that the majority are hardly Chinese at all. One of the largest ethnic groups is the Uyghur population, which is by far the most nationalist and well known ethnic group within Xinjiang. Two other notable groups are first the Kazakh population in the north with a population of about 400,000 and the Tungans in the south, the Xinjiang version of the Chinese Hui with a population around 450,000. The Tungans and Uyghurs are known for shaky relations, as the minority Tungans have long held control over the majority of Xinjiang, as seen now by the Dao-yin of Hotan being Ma Shaowu. Due to their overall separation from the Chinese people, the Uyghur and Kazakh population have long spelt the most trouble for our administration, rising up numerous times in the past in order to establish their independence from the rest of China."
