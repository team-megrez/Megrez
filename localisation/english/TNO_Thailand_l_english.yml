 POLITICS_THAWAN_THAMRONGNAWASAWAT_DESC: "Many wonder how absurd it would be for the Grand Marshal to have a friendly relationship with someone so distant from his doctrinal beliefs, but it seems Thawan Thamronnawasawat was just the man to stand firm in such a way to remain in his position. Commander-in-Chief of the tender, yet considerable, Thai Navy, Thawan's aloof stance has been considered by many apolitical; others thought him a dormant mastermind.\n\nRising in the ranks of Thailand's nascent navy, Thawan has served in the force from a time where the world considered the fleet ceremonial. Now, he presides over what he considers the pride of the nation's standing across the world; the seas offered Thawan a version of Thailand, however, a safe distance from the truth - his homeland was ruled by a tyrant, and no admiral could change the fact.\n\nAs the army frothed at the mouth with spewings of ideological militarism over the years, or indulged in opportunism to advance an officer's career with violent force, Thawan's navy, disciplined by crashing waves, remained largely unmolested by the stoked divisions that plagued its sister branch. Now, he sits in the seat of the President, keeping the divided army cliques at bay, and bitterly holding together the shattered pieces of the republic's legacy against military rebellion and civil war."
 POLITICS_PRIDI_BANOMYONG_DESC: "The new president of the Republic of Thailand sits in the most powerful seat in the country, but many still ask if he truly is the most influential man in Bangkok's halls of power. Swept into power with the vast support of the people and political establishment, Pridi Banomyong's election was an event many saw on the horizon, but none could know of its consequences.\n\nPridi's past relationship with the Khana Ratsudon is a complicated one; once respected as a nationalist who had worked tirelessly to establish a modern constitution as well as cancel unequal treaties with the west, he had fallen into partial disgrace as his rivalries with military wings of the party consumed his position of power. Plaek's rise to the seat of Prime Minister rolled Thailand further towards military dictatorship; Pridi could not stomach a dictator in place of an absolute monarch, and harbored resistance to the totalitarianism of the Grand Marshal's regime, before being shelved to positions of little temporal authority.\n\nToday, the Grand Marshal is no more, living only in the memories scarred into the landscape Pridi has inherited as president of the republic after Thawan's resignation, and yet his progeny crowd the young democracy. Pridi may have outlived Plaek and his thunderous wrath, but he could not outlive the deep marks he has left on Thailand forever."
 POLITICS_THANOM_KITTIKACHORN_DESC: "Thanom Kittikachorn knows war and cruel violence like few others in the halls of power; even fewer can leap with such dexterity to it. Organised, disciplined, and inexcusably fiendish, Thanom commands not only armies in the field, but the personal loyalties of those lurking in the shadows of government where one would least expect it.\n\nThe well-educated strategist spent his youth in military academies and institutions until the opening of war against the Europeans in 1940, wherein his service in the Burmese campaigns earned him promotions for his leadership and initiative under extreme pressure. To many, it seems the extreme pressure of the campaigns had built a monster out of a man excelling in the field, who then treated politics like war. Each medal pinned to his uniform were but insignia of his killings; rewards for his ruthlessness.\n\nThanom's grueling victories during Operation Issara in the East, as well as his rapacious influence in ascent to the inner circles of the Rongrean Nai Roi military clique, had spun him a web of influence, willingly or unwillingly ensnaring those in the general's orbit. Now, after launching a coup against the interim government, these snares have grown intrusive and more barbarous - his forces now run Thailand; he, the Commander-in-Chief of whatever horror he can craft from the mud of the battlefield."
 POLITICS_KRIS_SIVARA_DESC: "A man thrown into the bloody aftermath of Marshal Thanom's hate, and the screaming chaos that has swallowed the nation since, Kris Sivara is a man with the burden of millions of futures on his shoulders. Power rests in his junta's hands, yet as shadows begin to crawl from the corners of his vision, no one is sure of who can be trusted.\n\nIn his earlier years, Kris had risen to local prominence serving in the armed forces; his advances into British-controlled Burma had landed him among the same circles as Thanom Kittikachorn, wherein he consolidated relationships with those who would come to form the linchpins of the Saphan Kwai clique. Thanom, having taken notice of Kris' reputation, kept him neatly within select various commands and, after his coup, government posts to carefully monitor his activity - until it happened.\n\nThanom's barbarian reprisals of students and civilians in the streets of major cities had pushed Kris and other like-minded officers to act; they had forced the tyrant marshal from power, and severed the head of the brutal regime. Kris now heads a council running the young republic, whose wounds gape and bleed, gashed by the scourge of man. Only time will tell if his house of cards will stand on the shaky foundations so many have bled and wept over, and if dignity will wash up on Thailand's shores ever again."
 POLITICS_CHATICHAI_CHOONHAVAN_DESC: "The only son of Field Marshal Phin Choonhavan, supporter of the Phibunsongkhram regime and face of the old guard, Chatichai Choonhavan has stepped beyond the shoes of his father for some time now. His family name an insignia and rite-of-passage in Bangkok's halls of power, Chatichai has become a face frequented by anyone who is anyone in the young republic.\n\nAs war had raged on in Indochina against the French and then the British, Chatichai shadowed his father's efforts to lead the armed forces into battle and take the bloody fight to the imperialist europeans. Bravery under fire and excellent strategic planning, although restrained by the Japanese high command, had earned the Choonhavan name great fame and respect; he and his father's tales were often retold at dinner parties in wealthy establishments.\n\nHowever, as Operation Issara came to a grinding halt, and all of the republic's daggers were pointed to his father, Chatichai sat outside of the spotlight of Thailand's military affairs. Now that the Grand Marshal is dead, the ranks of soldiers call the Choonhavan name once again. Chatichai is young and inexperienced in the seat of the President, but few cast their doubts over his passion for justice."

 POLITICS_SANG_PHATHANOTHAI_DESC: "If anyone was to bet on Marshal Phibun's successor, they would have lost. Sang Phathanothai is no exception.\n\nSang was born in 1915. Growing up in poverty, people jokingly called him a camel since his idea of lunch was constrained to water and his first encounter with eating utensils was when he arrived in Bangkok. Yet at the same time the 'camel' was also extremely bookish, so much so that he ruined his eyesight and had to scrabble around for money to get glasses.\n\nAs he grew, he found himself a teacher known for his revolutionary fervour. When the Government tried to close his school, he led and organised a strike which forced the Khana Ratsadon to suspend the plans. This first strike led by students and teachers in Thai history was a great achievement for a man that had begun life too poor even to take the cheapest train to Bangkok.\n\nTime wore on, and Prime Minister Phibun noticed Sang's talents. Appointing him first a radio show host, then head of the Publicity Department and official spokesperson of the Thai Government, Phibun at last took him into his personal staff as an advisor. Not even Sarit Thanarat's assertion in 1957 that Sang was a communist was able to shake Phibun's trust in him; indeed, after the coup, Sang's next post was foreign minister, followed by the prime ministership after Wichit Wichitwathakarn's death.\n\nNow Sang Phathanothai sits on a throne he never thought a poor, outspoken Samut Prakan kid could attain. He knows who he has to thank for that—so he will continue Phibun's work while implementing his own radical economic policies and his vision for a new revolution where all Thais, rich and poor, unite under a single tri-coloured banner."
