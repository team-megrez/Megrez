 POLITICS_PIERRE_POUJADE_DESC:0 "If any person can bear the unfortunate task of representing the current devastation of France, it is Pierre Poujade. Steadily climbing the pillars of power in the chaos of the 1950's, he secured the Prime Ministership after Vignancour's successful bid for President. Enjoying his newfound position of power, Poujade was hopeful for a slow, careful political career. Of course, that all changed when Europe was once more thrown into utter mayhem.\n\nViolently thrust into the spotlight after the chaos of the Franco-Burgundian War, he was delegated the responsibility of grappling with yet another period of utter chaos as the political foundation of the French State fell through. Using his array of contacts, allies, and friends in the different strata of the remaining administration, Poujade managed to steer himself out of the fire and into the throne of power once more.\n\nPolitically, Poujade prides himself as the protector of the \"little man\", promoting a culture based around the founding principles of the state: Labor, Family, Fatherland. Promising a rebirth of a grand France, he does not delude himself into thinking it will be easy to rebuild his nation after the deluge of catastrophe which has struck it, especially with the hidden forces that lurk within the government, plotting to destroy his rule from within.\n\nShould he fail to keep these rotten forces at bay, the French State as he knows it may very well cease to exist. Should he succeed, however it will finally begin to emerge from the ashes of oppression."

Losing both his father and his brothers in the Second World War, Pierre stands out in the scene of nationalism in being a stern pacifist.\n\nCreating a new movement in the 1950s, which aimed to embrace the new German World Order as well as to push against the rapidly-spreading flame of socialist and communist movements across the country. This movement, named the Mouvement Occident, became his gateway into the vast world of French politics.\n\nA passionate speaker, able to easily sway crowds with his intricate knowledge of expressions and mannerisms, he quickly rose the ranks. Becoming the head of the Parti Populaire Français, he led the party to become the flagship nationalist and most German-friendly party in France.\nFollowing the Franco-Burgundinian war and the ensuing chaos, Sidos finally found his chance to strike. Securing the Presidency, he now bears his responsibility - the completion of the Révolution Nationale - to extinguish the weak democracy of France, to promote a Europe that is united in brothership (including with the Germans), and finally, to return to the fundamental values which founded the French State."

 POLITICS_ANTOINE_PINAY_DESC:0 "Brave men carry the torch of liberty even when to do so is hard. Braver men still craft this torch from the ashes of oppression - and Antoine Pinay is one such man.\n\nA long-standing veteran of French politics, Antoine Pinay has long been mired in the politics of France, serving in both the Third Republic as well as the subsequent French State. A charismatic and eloquent speaker, he used his relative popularity among the population to assert himself as a moderate and an industrialist in the Parti National. Pinay is a firm believer in the dream of a truly fair French State, taking the mantle on the reformation of France following the death of Pierre Laval as the leader of the reformist wing of the Parti National. However, despite enjoying a broad support base, Pinay never did have the chance to truly push his reformist ideals - sidelined by the numerous hardliners of the French State, many thought that his ideals of a fair France would never see the light of day.\n\nOf course, then Burgundian tanks entered Paris. In the ensuing chaos, Antoine Pinay, along with the rest of the Réformistes, successfully made a bid for the seat of power in France, bringing the reformist light to France once more.\n\nHe now controls a shattered nation - shellshocked from the war, with the already-tenuous political system having been utterly destroyed, the fragile foundations giving way to the pressures of reality. With the conservative elements of the Parti National plot in the darkness, while the flame of extremism continues to spread unchecked throughout the population, Pinay certainly knows he does not have an easy path ahead of him.\n\nRegardless of all of the obstacles he faces, Pinay will never give up hope on his dream: a new France, free, fair and democratic. In the end, he seeks nothing less than the restoration of the French Republic - and he will go through any steps necessary to ensure that Democracy will triumph."

Even with the fall of the French Republic, his critical work on the French Revolution continues to inspire the reactionary and oligarchical upper class of the French State.\n\nAn underling of the far-right political theorist Charles Maurras, he has kept his mentor's party, Action Française, from collapsing following his death. Seeking to return the Bourbon dynasty of the pre-Revolution monarchy back to the throne and highly critical of Pétain's rule, Gaxotte has remained a relatively minor force in French politics. Now, as its President, he intends to use his power to revive monarchism in France, regardless of what its people think. Backed by the forces of reaction, Gaxotte intends to crush what remains of France's revolutionary spirit."

You know how many of those we get on a single day, Tobias?!\" The man stuttered for a moment before recomposing himself.\n\n\"Yes, sir, but I don't think a convoy precipitates a fucking agricultural mission, it's en route to your office now.\"\n\nOpening the letter, Hermann's mind raced as to what it could contain, as his eyes dragged across the page. Muttering to himself, he recited the rough details of the page.\n\n\"Yadda yadda, new geopolitical situation, yadda yadda, holy shit.\" Hermann reread the page, then picked the phone off its receiver, and dialed for Germania.\n\n\"Herr Schneider, we trust you have good news?\"\n\n\"Yes, Herr Wagner, we have.

The French PPF was a monster of a political party, all-powerful and entirely unpredictable, even to itself. Those in favor of any number of other allies all constantly at war with itself, and the German majority had won out. Until the leader of the German faction and Prime Minister, Pierre Drieu la Rochelle, died almost out of nowhere. Figures. Now the parliament would be nearly split down the middle a dozen different ways, and a letter was sitting on his desk, from a pro-Italian cabinet member whose message was now withdrawn entirely, though then received a third letter that the first was still official. Hermann massaged his brow reading the umpteenth dossier on parliament members he could still reach out towards and attempt to help, or at least offer some kind of reassurance, but the rest of the parliament was not making it any easier. Recognizing his phone ringing, Hermann picked up the receiver.\n\n\"Herman Schneider, ambassador to France?\"\n\n\"Schneider. You told us France is coming back, so would you care to explain the-\"\n\nSchneider cut in. \"I am aware of the situation, sir, I've been the one informing you, if you hadn't noticed. You understand what's happened to the PPF with la Rochelle, don't you? The situation is spiralling and will continue to do so until they set themselves straight, and I've already requested for our 'intervention' however possible. There is nothing new to report, so if you in Germania would stop bothering me in this regard, it would be deeply, deeply appreciated.\" A moment of hesitancy passed on the other side of the phone, and Schneider heard a deep sigh emanate from the line.\n\n\"Thank you, Herr ambassador.

The French remained egregiously indecisive, as seemed to be the norm at this point. On the bright side, they'd seemed to calm down their politics, much to the pleasure of pundits in Germania, though it hardly eased Schneider's nerves in any capacity. Pulling the ashtray closer as Schneider attempted to light a cigarette one-handed, the lighter slipped from his hands. Lunging for the silver, Schneider yanked the ashtray back, showering him in cinders and ash. At that moment, the phone rang.\n\n\"Yes?! Christ on a crutch Tobias what do you fucking-\"\n\nTobias spoke without breath or pause. \"Yessir but the French are on line 1 and they refuse to stop calling putting them on no-\" With a prolonged beep, Schneider could hear the shallow breathing of someone on the other side.\n\n\"Ambassador Hermann Schneider speaking, who is this?\"\n\n\"Good afternoon, Herr Schneider, this is Pierre Sidos. I am inquiring as to whether Germany would be willing to host a visit from the French delegation in approximately a week's time- details can be clarified before, but I am asking, Germania be interested in this offer?\" Schneider went blank white, reaching to his lips for a cigarette. All Hermann found was a small puff of ash covering his face, and realized there must be a pile of cinders coating his face. Struggling to focus on the topic at hand, Schneider contemplated whether or not to take the offer. On the one hand, the French might finally be reigned in, and if this was the first step to do it, showing how open Germany was to old friends could prove a boon. On the other hand, the French had thus far only proven a liability prone to infighting, and potentially collapse, though that was far from reasonable, Schneider admitted to himself."

They were convinced they had failed.\n\nThen, suddenly, the phone rang. It was the French, both men were sure of it. The two jumped up from their lethargic positions and raced to the phone. Shoving and yelling, both tried grabbing the phone. After a small slap fight, Efrain managed to capture the phone, holding his Portuguese counterpart away with his other arm.\n\nEfrain warmly greeted the voice on the other end with a big grin plastered on his face. \"Hello, this is Efrain from the Iberian embassy, how can I help you?\"\n\n\"This is President Pierre Sidos, Monsieur Efrain. I was wondering if Iberia would be willing to host a diplomatic visit in the next week. We can work the details out later, but I need to know if such a thing is possible.\" Efrain was in shock. He had not expected the caller to be the President, let alone requesting a visit.\n\nAs tempting as a yes was, the answer was not so easy. Taking the offer would commit them to their neighbor, and the thought of sabotage was not impossible. God forbid there be another Malta. Yet, the two were neighbors and more economic cooperation would never hurt. Miguel, who had been eavesdropping the entire time, stole the phone in Efrain's contemplation.

Sidos, Salazar, and Franco all greeted each other with a familiarity that seemed all too familiar. In the city, the three dined on the nation's fine delicacies, catching up on past times that did not exist.\n\nFrom there, the three traveled together to Madrid for the real show. The two Caudillos showed their soon-to-be ally around the city as Iberia's most privileged tourist. Franco took special pleasure in showing their guest around his half of the union, yet the special attention all went over the President's head.\n\nAt last, the fun had to end, and both parties found themselves in an empty room with nothing but a table. Trade dominated the discussion. From tariffs on wine to wider agreements on industrial goods, everything was covered. Perhaps most interesting of all though, was the idea of a Latin Union, the two nations combined in a new power block that could halt that of the Germans and Italians.\n\nDespite the appeal, the idea did not feel quite ready. In the future, the three men confirmed to themselves. Still, as Sidos boarded a train back to France following another night of parties, the three men were left satisfied.
