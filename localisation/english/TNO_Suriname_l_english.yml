  SUR_1947_Constitution:0 "The 1947 Dutch Constitution"
  SUR_1947_Constitution_desc:0 "Talk of constitutional reform was already commonplace during the government's exile in London; however, when the government was forced into further exile in the Caribbean, there was no choice; the constitution was reformed.\n\nThe new Constitution of 1947 is not too different from the previous one in its underpinnings: it espouses the fundamental values of freedom and democracy, under a constitutional monarchy. However, it is different in one major thing: it provides ample autonomy to the various remaining Caribbean colonies, which have become constituent democracies within the democracy that is the exiled Kingdom of the Netherlands."
  SUR_Poster_Boy_OFN:0 "Poster Boy of the OFN"
  SUR_Poster_Boy_OFN_desc:0 "Being one of the last standing members of the old Allied Powers, the exile-government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Suriname is a member of the Organization of Free Nations. However, because of the obvious difficulties presented by being a government exiled to a rump portion of its former colonial empire, it is heavily reliant on extensive loans and other assistance to keep itself afloat.\n\nAs a result of the flow of aid to Suriname, the country has become known as the poster-boy of the OFN, a democracy kept alive and made to flourish by the extensive assistance of its free, democratic allies. While this has led to a strong economic situation, that strength is in fact fragile, as the country is quite strongly dependent on OFN assistance."

  SUR_queen_wilhelmina:0 "Queen Wilhelmina"
  SUR_queen_wilhelmina_desc:0 "The only child of King Willem III of the Netherlands and Emma of Waldeck-Pyrmont, Wilhelmina of the Netherlands became queen at the age of 10. After taking charge of the government after a regency, Wilhelmina was popular for maintaining Dutch neutrality during the First World War and helping to solve many of her country's industrial problems. Her business ventures made her the world's first female billionaire; she went on to ensure that her family was one of the few European royal houses remaining in existence. But all that went to hell when the Nazis came.\n\nFollowing the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940, Wilhelmina fled to Britain and took charge of the Dutch government-in-exile. The fall of the United Kingdom to the Germans was a just as grave a blow to her as the loss of her homeland, and she had to flee to the Caribbean. Shortly after her arrival in Suriname, Wilhelmina tried to abdicate; however, the government refused to permit it, as the government in exile was in no condition to take such a strain. However, it was later agreed that her daughter, Crown Princess Juliana, would take her place in events and ceremonies while she remained queen.\n\nIn the 40s, Dirk Jan de Geer left, and was replaced by Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy. Later Gerbrandy too retired, utterly exhausted by the strains of governance; he was replaced by the mild-mannered Aat van Rhijn. But it changed nothing: Wilhelmina, as always, remains at odds with the government."

  SUR_queen_juliana:0 "Queen Juliana"
  SUR_queen_juliana_desc:0 "Queen Juliana of the Netherlands is the only child of Queen Wilhelmina and Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She received a private education and studied international law at the University of Leiden. In 1937, she married Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld; with him she had four daughters: Beatrix, Irene, Margriet, and Christina. During the German invasion in the Second World War, the royal family was evacuated to the United Kingdom; eventually, Juliana and her children went to Canada while Bernhard and Wilhelmina remained behind; when the United Kingdom was invaded, the rest of the family joined Juliana in Canada and then went to Suriname, where the Dutch exile government had at last settled down.\n\nSince the decline of her mother in the late 40s, Juliana has been essentially de-facto Queen-in-exile of the Netherlands, replacing her mother at ceremonies and events. Despite the apparent strength of the Hitlerite tyranny over the Kingdom of the Netherlands, she remains optimistic that Amsterdam will be liberated someday. Even if that does not take place, she refuses to despair; in that case she will most willingly join her exile government in entering into formal agreements with the Caribbean colonies to form a real country, evolving beyond this transitory state of affairs."

  SUR.2.t:0 "The Death of Queen Wilhelmina"
  SUR.2.desc:0 "Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, exiled in Suriname, has died of cardiac arrest in her makeshift residence in Paramaribo where she has stayed since the government-in-exile's decampment to the Caribbean. The death came as no surprise: Wilhelmina had long been ill, forcing her daughter, the now-Queen Juliana, to assume more and more of her duties.\n\nThe Dutch Caribbean - at times plagued by disagreements - unites to mourn her death; mourning has even been reported in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands. At the late queen's request, the funeral was performed in white vestments rather than black in reflection of her Christian belief that death was merely the beginning of eternal life. Due to the circumstances, a special cemetery has been built in Paramaribo to house her remains; however, government sources indicate that if Amsterdam is ever freed, she will join her ancestors in the Royal Crypt there."
  SUR.2.a:0 "Our condolences."

  #Leaders descs 
  AAT_VAN_RHIJN_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Dr. Arie Adriaan "Aat" van Rhijn, a civil servant and politician, was born in Groningen in 1892; he studied at the universities of Utrecht and Groningen and served in various functions - for company associations, employee associations, five or six different ministries, and so on - until his appointment to Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries mere days before the German invasion.\n\nFleeing to London, and then from there to Ottawa and Paramaribo, van Rhijn watched as the Kingdom of Netherlands fell to a low from which it has only slightly recovered since, as the Nazi jackboot gouged into the Netherlands and the Yamato 'anti-colonialists' 'liberated' the Dutch East Indies. Van Rhijn was able to come through the last twenty years more or less sane, but others - such as Prime Ministers Dirk Jan de Geer and Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy, to say nothing of Queen Wilhelmina - were less well off; van Rhijn had to watch in sadness as so many people he knew and respected declined into misery, sickness, and decrepitude.\n\nGerbrandy, exhausted beyond belief, stepped down in the mid 1950s, choosing van Rhijn to take over; the far-flung people of Suriname have come to consider him a good fit for the job. A competent statesman, administrator, operating as a moderate Protestant conservative with significant respect for non-Protestants and the labor movement, Aat van Rhijn strives to stay the course, reforming only with common consent, for fear of upsetting the modus vivendi created in this country of exiles, immigrants, and colonists."
