HIS_Hispaniola_War: "The Hispaniolan Conflict"
HIS_Hispaniola_War_desc: "Hispaniola has been torn by war ever since both nations that inhabit it have had their independence. After the American occupation ended, however, things appeared to calm down, with the elections of Lescot Sr., a friend of Trujillo, possibly signaling a new age of peace between the two states.\n\nThings would not remain like this for long. With the two dictators butting heads soon after and as American interference in Haiti once more increased, tensions between the two nations began growing again over time. With clashes on the borders between the two being frequent, the larger and better trained Dominican army broke the agreed 1936 borders and occupied Haitian land.\n\nWith the Haitian army barely being able to control its own territory as guerrillas dominate the countryside, the invasion and occupation came to be a national embarrassment that has only deepened the pit that the Haitian government found itself in. With revanchism being in the mind of many, it is almost inevitable that war on the island is bound to break out again, sooner or later."

PPI_civil_war: "The Dominican Civil War"
PPI_civil_war_desc: "The present parlous state of our Republic brings into stark relief the way in which the best efforts and plans of humanity fail to survive in the face of folly and faithlessness. Our work was insufficient to promote a diplomatic solution to the present chaos, and now the whole of Quisqueya bleeds.\n\nToday, ruthless effort is demanded of us. This is a final showdown between the old order and the new, a brutish time of monsters out of which only one faction can emerge victorious. Woe to the vanquished; into the victor's hands shall fall the right to chart the future of the Dominican Republic."

# Leader descs
POLITICS_HAI_DEJOIE_DESC: "Descendant of a French slaveholder and of President Fabre Geffrard, who threw down the Second Haitian Empire, President Louis Déjoie has not had to go far to attain his present position. Though he might protest otherwise, for the average Haitian it is clear that the Presidency was as much a hand-me-down to Déjoie as his sugar plantations and landholdings.\n\nDéjoie was born the son of wealthy landowners; cozying up to the Establishment was in his DNA. It made all the more sense, then, that he would tie himself closely to his friend and mentor, Élie Lescot. Twenty years of mulattocratic government passed, and Déjoie joined his boss in enriching himself.\n\nMeanwhile, things changed. Dewey's government—that had been so loyal to the Lescot presidency passed on, and things became incrementally more difficult with time. Eventually Lescot was sent out, and a successor was sitting in the office next door: need one say who it was? The answer was obvious even to the most out-of-touch diplomat's wife or to the poorest, most oppressed black citizen.\n\nSome feel enough shame about open corruption and oligarchy where they try to deliver to the average people as a sort of quid pro quo. Not Déjoie—to him there is no use changing things from the way Lescot used to do them. He may be his own man, but he is as much an avatar of the mulattocracy as his predecessor, and just as willing to keep the levers of power in mulatto hands as Lescot was."
POLITICS_HAI_JACQUES_STEPHEN_DESC: "'It is said that to be a Haitian is to be an African, but Jacques-Stephen Alexis takes the sentiment one step further. To him, the same is true in reverse, with Haiti itself being an amalgamation of African culture and identity. This in turn creates a dream of a future that would one day connect the island nation to the ancestral homeland via a united struggle against colonialism.\n\nBorn in Gonaïves, Haiti in 1922, Jacques-Stephen Alexis began his academic pursuits from a young age, eventually attending school in both France and the United States to study medicine. While abroad, he developed both an appreciation for writing and communism, both of which he viewed as tools to be used to help his downtrodden nation escape her captors.\n\nA strong contributor to the "Negritude" movement, aimed at promoting a positive and affirming African identity, Alexis engaged with pan-African ideals early in his life via his writing. He also began traveling in socialist circles, enjoying the anti-imperialist aspect of the various Marxist ideologies, and eventually went on to lead the PPLN as his support grew in the countryside.\n\nAs the PPLN consolidates its power with Alexis at the helm, it has become apparent that there is a new chapter being written in Haitian history, one that could propel it away from the colonial influence of the West and into the arms of her overseas brothers and sisters. Jacques only hopes that the United States and other foreign powers won't be able to undermine his movement as they have tried so many times before."
POLITICS_HAI_CANTAVE_DESC: "If there is one thing that General Léon Cantave can always spare time for, it is listening to someone or another criticise democracy and socialism—for, with time, that has become one of his own favourite pastimes.\n\nThe old governance of Haiti was at best flawed. The 'democratically' 'elected' presidents, Lescot and Déjoie, were at best corrupt egomaniacs and at worst simple drooling imbeciles only competent at taking things for themselves. What did one need to read antidemocratic propaganda in Haiti, when the mulattocrats were more than enough proof of its flaws?\n\nThen it emerged that Haitians were being led astray by socialism. How the Haitian people could make such an error was beyond him. Were the disasters of socialist-adjacent France, of the Spanish Republicans, of Cuba and the Soviet Union, not a sufficient warning against following that path?\n\nObviously, this could not stand, and the army did not let it stand—instead, Léon Cantave took power and removed the socialists and democrats from control over the nation. Adherents of decadent, failed ideologies may complain—but their opinions matter not. Léon Cantave, now President of the Republic of Haiti, will assume sole responsibility for the Haitian people. Since everyone else has failed, let them be silent: Cantave will handle everything from now on."
POLITICS_HAI_FIGNOLE_DESC: "Haiti has witnessed upon years of instability and misery, years of racialist misgovernance by which the Haitian people were subtracted in shadowy transactions. Decades of folly piled upon folly passed wherein the nation suffered, and the Dominicans and others gained advantage after advantage at the expense of the Haitian government and people alike.\n\nIt was not as if Daniel 'le Professeur' Fignolé sat by and did nothing while his country bled. A thoroughgoing liberal, he defied the Lescot and Déjoie governments day in and day out. Lescot's lot retaliated against Fignolé frequently: if he wrote denunciations, his paper was closed and he would get fired. But it had its benefit—his fiery orations gained him the popularity of the people, who held "woulo konpresè" or "steamroller" strikes against the mulattocrat tyranny.\n\nDefeat after defeat was demoralizing but Fignolé would've been content to keep fighting even unto death. But things changed: Franck Lavaud's junta was unable to govern dictatorially, and the new President was even more frightened of a Dominican attack than he was of democrats or communists. Therefore, he turned to 'the Professor'—and convinced the remnants of the elite to accept Fignolé as president at the same time as Fignolé convinced people further left than he to settle his governance for a time.\n\nNow the Haitian nation is united behind a single leader for a time. Armed forces, wealthy landowners, socialist revolutionaries, and the common labourer must work together until Trujillo joins Napoleon and all the other tyrants six feet under ground. By all that is good, Fignolé swears, he will not rest until freedom rings in every settlement on the island."
POLITICS_HAI_FRANCOIS_DUVALIER_DESC: "The mulattos call François Duvalier a dangerous man, a threat to law and order. The Afro-Haitian majority—especially those most hostile to the élite and most strongly adherent to Négritude and black nationalism—regarde him as the bearer of their hopes. The military, who are the other half of his support base, call him 'a good sort'.\n\nBut everyone—starting with the patients he served so diligently in his younger days and continuing to military men, foreigners, and diplomats—calls him Papa Doc.\n\nWhere his path to power was not at all certain, his views always were: racism and violence that occurred during the United States occupation of Haiti in the late 1910s inspired black nationalism among Haitians and left a powerful impression on the young Duvalier. Duvalier saw the poor black majority and their resentment against the mulattocracy. Supporting Pan-African ideals, he became involved in the local Négritude movement, beginning a long and chaotic political journey interrupted by returns to his medical doctorate—\n\n—and now, suddenly, by an upset victory, he is President of Haiti. Most believe that he will destroy the old mulattocrat elite and oppose the Americans; beyond that, however, his policies are anyone's guess, and he may well travel down a path no-one was expecting."
POLITICS_HAI_HUDICOURT_DESC: "Haiti has witnessed upon years of instability and misery, years of racialist misgovernance by which the Haitian people were subtracted in shadowy transactions. Decades of folly piled upon folly passed wherein the nation suffered, and the Dominicans and others gained advantage after advantage at the expense of the Haitian government and people alike.\n\nMax Lélio Hudicourt was not one to sit around while the nation was betrayed. His venerable old uncle, Senator Pierre Hudicourt, mentored him and watched approvingly as the young man became known as a gifted orator and contributor to left-wing thought in Haiti. Graduating as a lawyer, Hudicourt the younger became an employee of his senatorial uncle's firm.\n\nHudicourt's left-wing thoughts were offensive to the US, to Sténio Vincent, to Élie Lescot, to all the despotisms and hegemonies within and outside Haiti. They were not satisfied to disagree with him, either—time and again they tortured him, arrested him and his friends, shuttered his publications and expelled him from his places of work. But none of this deterred him; instead, it tempered his steel—and unified many sections of Haitian society in admiration for him.\n\nNow, the hour has come: the government has one way or another given way, and Hudicourt is now in charge. Much relies on him, and many disparate factions have put their faith in him to stabilize the United Front and transition it into a permanent, functional government. By the people and all their merits Hudicourt swears that he will honour their trust or die in the attempt."
POLITICS_HAI_LAVAUD_DESC: "If one peers into the office of former General, now President, Franck Lavaud, one sees many of the trappings of the old mulattocratic government of Lescot and his successor, who Lavaud characterizes as "Lescot's running dog Déjoie," left strewn on the floor, thrown down from their old perches. Small wonder, when Lavaud has taken it upon himself to do away with his former bosses' asinine racialist policies to the best of his ability.\n\nThe Lescot and Déjoie (mis)governance existed for almost as long as Lavaud was in active service as a general. Assuming control of the Garde d'Haiti and the Ministry of Defense in 1944, he watched as Lescot's over-proximity to Trujillo permitted the latter to gain advantage after advantage at Haiti's expense. Meanwhile, while the mulattocratic élite kept singing that pervert's praises, all Lavaud could see from Trujillo was the same old ambition to do as they had always wanted to do and annex Haiti.\n\nWith time Haiti's lack of readiness became intolerable. Were the Lescot government to remain in power, either Trujillo's dream would become reality faster than Lavaud could say 'putain de merde', or the masses of Port-au-Prince would fly into an abject rage and hand the country over to communist maniacs. So he did what any other military man would do in his situation—throw down the President, mobilise the military, and initiate sorely needed reforms.\n\nLavaud is not like le Professeur or Kanson Fè. Democracy or tolerance for the left, these are not in his vocabulary. But obliterating the mulattocracy? Oh, that's something Lavaud is all too happy to do—for only an imbecile would dare say the mulatto élites have done worth a damn of good with their power to the present day."
POLITICS_HAI_LESCOT_DESC: "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.\n\nFrom the outset of his governance, President Antoine Louis Léocardie Élie Lescot has ruled by his own will and his own will alone. Juvenal's Satires held the mindset of "thus I will it, so I order it; let my will replace reasoned judgment" in contempt: Lescot, on the other hand, embraced it enthusiastically.\n\nTwenty years of kleptocratic corruption—or, as Lescot calls it, strategic direction of funds—combined with a method of governance denounced as regressive by everyone except Lescot and his friends and beneficiaries preserved his hold on power even as the Allies lost the Second World War and the Dominican Republic fell into chaos. But alas, the blacks did not understand their rightful place—below the mulattos and whites—and began to revolt; Lescot had no choice but to abdicate to his understudy.\n\nWell, that time is no more; the interregnum has ended. Lescot has returned to power, even if the masses below him are complaining as loudly as they ever have. The Americans will do their duty, and preserve his government as they did once before; the will of the people of Haiti need not factor into any decisions. All that matters is that the right people remain in charge, and that the right person sits at their head."
POLITICS_HAI_MAGLOIRE_DESC: "General Paul Eugène Magloire, referred to as Kanson Fè (Iron Pants) by Haitians, is now the last hope of the common civilian in Haiti as Trujillo's cronies and doctrinaire communists beleaguer the state.\n\nMagloire has a checkered past. Sometimes, he has stood against despotism, but other times he has opportunistically supported it. At one time he was one of Lescot's most loyal supporters in the military—but then he saw the rage of the common people and decided it would be more prudent to throw the mulattocrat and his successor out.\n\nNow the situation is sensitive, for Haiti is beleaguered in two directions. Though there is some support from outside, the nation's defense must be competently and cautiously executed. The Haitian government must work in a broad coalition, with all desirous to work for the stability of the Nation welcomed and given a role to play.\n\nYet more importantly, the mistakes and folly of Cantave's dictatorship must be undone, and democracy and high liberalism take their place. Otherwise, the nation will have survived 150 years of difficulties for nothing."

# Ideas
HAI_Mulatocratie: "La Mulâtocratie"
HAI_Mulatocratie_desc: "As American troops landed in the Republic of Haiti and its occupation of the nation began, collaborators who would work with the US in the new regime. These would be the mulatto elite of the Republic, being propelled to powerful political and economic positions, giving them much control over the state. This system came to be known as the "mulattocracy" by many in the country and was deeply associated with the United States and its influence over the country.\n\nWhile this positive discrimination would only worsen after the Lescot Sr. government refused to bulge on the status quo and implement reforms, many would begin putting their hopes in Pierre Déjoie and his reformist platform, promising to bring the much-needed changes to the state. While economically the nation has seen a revival, politically it got nothing more than token reforms to a crumbling status-quo, leading many to lose hope in the government and instead turn to opposition groups."
HAI_Mulatocratie_Lavaud: "La Mulâtocratie"
HAI_Mulatocratie_Lavaud_desc: "As American troops landed in the Republic of Haiti and its occupation of the nation began, the mulatto elite acted as collaborators to the new regime. In turn, they were propelled to powerful political and economic positions, giving them much control over the state. This system of "mulattocracy" has been deeply associated with the United States and its influence over Haiti.\n\nDespite the regression suffered under Lescot Sr. and the false promises of Déjoie, the regime of Frank Lavaud has begun to actually implement reforms aimed at rooting out many of these corrupt practices. This includes opening government positions to Black Haitians and in turn reducing the domination by the mulatto elite. As the reforms are implemented, however, it is evident that the "mulattocracy" will continue to maintain  a disproportionate level of control in Haiti so long as the United States still has a hand in the nation's politics."
HAI_La_Fausse_Democratie: "La Fausse Démocratie"
HAI_La_Fausse_Democratie_desc: "With the end of the Haitian Civil War, Lavaud found himself in a situation in which his reformist faction became the dominant party in the Haiti political scene, able to implement many of the changes he was incapable of beforehand. Every day, Lavaud and his party become bolder and bolder in their attempts to dismantle the "mulattocracy" through anti-corruption measures coupled with bureaucratic cycling.\n\nDespite this, it is evident that corruption will survive the ruling elite. Lavaud's party has no intention of democratizing a nation they now govern unopposed, and for many in Haiti life will go on much as it has for the past decades."
HAI_Le_Souverain: "Le Souverain"
HAI_Le_Souverain_desc: "With the shifting of the tides, the "mulattocracy" of Haiti has been swept under the waves of black nationalism. Duvalier's sudden rise and consolidation of power under his right-wing populist party has seen attacks on the upper-class mulatto elite, seeking to strip the power that they have accumulated under American involvement and give it to black Haitians.\n\nAdvocating a removal of US influence from the island, there is now less support from abroad to fight the PPLN and internal enemies of the regime. Duvalier is confident, however, that he and his supporters in the military can prevail against all threats that abound the unstable nation."
HAI_La_Tonton_Macoute: "La Tonton Macoute"
HAI_La_Tonton_Macoute_desc: "The old man who disappears unruly children by throwing them into his sack is a common folklore trope throughout the world. But in Haiti this supernatural figure really does exist, with a legion using his name to strike terror and fear into their enemies. From top to bottom, nobody is safe from disappearance, rape, or public murder. At the top of it all is one man: François Duvalier.\n\nDuvalier, having survived all the challenges to his rule that came before, now cements his regime firmly in Haiti's soil. His National Unity Party has supplanted the mulatto elite with one based on loyalty. His MVSN paramilitary enforces the will of one of the most totalitarian regimes in the history of the Americas. Holding a personalist state backed by violence and mysticism, Duvalier is nigh unassailable, at the cost of the entire nation living in fear and dread."
HAI_La_Cantavecratie: "La Cantavecratie"
HAI_La_Cantavecratie_desc: "Once there was a ruling group of mulattos in Haiti. A select few who thought they knew better than anyone else by virtue of their race and birth. They failed. Today there is instead one man who makes the decisions, and he alone knows what the masses really need. His name is Leon Cantave.\n\nCantave's self-centered dictatorship has no need for false, plutocratic democracy. The focus is on exterminating Communists that rot the structure of the country from within. Even though he accepts American aid, he falls short of the more high minded ideals of the Organization of Free Nations with a regime that grows more repressive by the day. All this makes him a headache to DC. However, he promised an end to the PPLN, and he makes good on those words, so the OFN has no choice but keep quiet."

HAI_Professionalism_Army_3: "Militia Army"
HAI_Professionalism_Army_2: "Militia Army"
HAI_Professionalism_Army_1: "Militia Army"

HAI_Occupation: "Everlasting American Presence"
HAI_Occupation_desc: "While the occupation of Haiti by the United States nominally ended in 1934, with the last of the American troops leaving the nation by that same year, the influence of the occupier however wouldn't disappear just like that, as the US has kept control over the policies of the nation thus far.\n\nWhile some hoped that this would eventually come to fade away as time went on, the defeat of the Allies in the Second World War would change American plans for the region. Supporting the Lescot Sr. government in its clamping down on student and popular protests, the US once again took an active role in the country's politics, making sure that the region continued under its sphere of influence. However, their backing of pro-American oligarchs has inevitably resulted in many joining opposition groups who now engage in guerrilla warfare against the government with the goal of kicking the Americans out.\n\nWith these guerrillas only growing in strength after the success of the Cuban Revolution, the Haitian government has only become a larger and larger resource drain for the OFN, who now rely on "safekeeping troops" to guarantee some semblance of control. On both sides of the aisle, everyone questions how much longer the never-ending occupation can truly last."
HAI_Renewed_Haitian_Sovereignty: "Renewed Haitian Sovereignty"
HAI_Renewed_Haitian_Sovereignty_desc: "With the withdrawal of American military presence from Haiti and the resolution of the inner conflicts, the nation has once more been able to assert its sovereignty in its own affairs. In place of foreign soldiers, a small but growing military under sole command of Port-au-Prince has been nurtured into a standing army that will serve to give the nation defensive autonomy for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile many institutional problems still remain hovering over Haiti, the market growth and reinforced self determination has given many in the country hope that things may at least be getting better."
HAI_Struggle_for_Sovereignty: "Struggle for Sovereignty"
HAI_Struggle_for_Sovereignty_desc: "Duvalier does not enjoy American influence in Haiti, but considering the circumstances and his preference for US soft power over Dominican hard power, he is playing along with the OFN for now. At times his regime is easy to work with, at times it seeks to distance itself from the American agenda, and occasionally it has little to say at all. It is certainly a dynamic relationship, as well as quite tenuous.\n\nBut an alliance of convenience is a fickle thing. If Washington fails to properly intervene in Haitian affairs, the small nation may break away or succumb to invasion. Of course, such intervention could also cause devastating push back from Port-au-Prince if unchecked."

HAI_Noirisme_Socialism: "The Ghost of Roumain"
HAI_Noirisme_Socialism_desc: "After decades of economic and social inequality, with the mulatto aristocracy dominating every facet of the state, the ideals of Socialism and Noirism have become ingrained into the consciousness of the Black population of Haiti. However, while Noirism has always dominated the ideology of the opposition, the guerrilla-favoring Socialists, emboldened by the Cuban Revolution, have seen a rapid rise in popularity and support, leading to clashes between groups that supported either one of these.\n\nThese two, however, are coming to find themselves united under a single banner, with the issues of class and racial identity no longer being opposite but instead intertwined with one another. Bringing back the Pan-Africanism of Jacques Roumain that had all but died with him in 1944, Jacques-Stephen Alexis and his Parti d'Entente Populaire now dominates the opposition against the government, denouncing both the Americans and Trujillo, becoming widely popular in the process."
HAI_Rising_PPLN_Insurgency: "Rising PPLN Insurgency"
HAI_Rising_PPLN_Insurgency_desc: "After the chaos and carnage of the Puerto Plata Invasion, instability has flooded over the border with the Dominican Republic on the backs of refugees. This has created an opportunity for the PPLN, a socialist rebel organization, to grow in strength and boldness, culminating in a situation in which the government is quickly being drawn towards confrontation.\n\nThis insurgency threatens to engulf Haiti in war unless drastic action is taken. However, the international community places little faith in the government's ability to effectively reform or counter the rebels in effective time."
HAI_Protracted_Guerrilla_Campaign: "Protracted Guerrilla Campaign"
HAI_Protracted_Guerrilla_Campaign_desc: "Guerillas have mobilized in the East and Southwest of Haiti, creating a situation in which government forces no longer have control over portions of the countryside. The situation has yet to devolve into civil war, yet rebel numbers grow by the day as the PPLN weaponizes discontent with Port-au-Prince and anti-American sentiment.\n\nThe government is now gearing up for a fight for the survival of the existing ruling apparatus, a task which will now likely only be solved through violent confrontation, one way or another. It is time to start requesting foreign aid."

HAI_Lunite_Instable: "L'Unité Instable"
HAI_Lunite_Instable_desc: "Desperate times create strange and impossible political realities, and none more so than war. With the invasion by the Dominican Republic, Haiti has found its tense internal situation turned upside down as pragmatism forces the various parties to put a hold on their differences to fight off occupation. This "united front" seeks to hold the oligarchic establishment, reformists, and PPLN together for the duration of the conflict, allowing for greater resistance to Trujillo's legions.\n\nWhile many would see this as an opportunity for Haiti to overcome its horrifying instability, history gives little reason for much optimism in a country gripped by its divisions, even if they are able to win the current struggle."
HAI_La_Renaissance_dHaiti: "La Renaissance d'Haïti"
HAI_La_Renaissance_dHaiti_desc: "Despite the pessimistic outlook of the international community, the carnage and devastation of war, and internal divisions once thought impossibly wide, Haiti has emerged from the invasion by the Dominican Republic reforged anew. The "united front" between the establishment, reformists, and PPLN has held, and although no party is entirely satisfied, none are willing to once more take up arms against their fellow countrymen.\n\nCaution prevails as multiethnic democracy is tried in Haiti, a nation so used to being dominated by racial tensions that this period can only be described as experimental. Despite corruption still remaining an issue, however, the economic growth and newly accessible government has fostered a sense of hope in the common man that the worst may finally be behind them."

HAI_Haitian_Social_Revolution: "Haitian Social Revolution"
HAI_Haitian_Social_Revolution_desc: "It is no easy task to redirect social forces away from destructive racial conflict and towards healing the scars it left. Haiti under the new socialist regime attempts to engender a new era of equality and harmony, unifying a racially diverse working class against what remains of capitalism in their nation. These attempts have seen mixed results; those scars run too deep to fade so quickly. But if they succeed, then the dreams of Louverture, Dessalines and Pétion will finally be made reality."
HAI_LArmee_Rouge_dHaiti: "L'Armée Rouge d'Haïti"
HAI_LArmee_Rouge_dHaiti_desc: "With the revolution of the PPLN successful comes the ongoing process of reforming Haitian military strength; the absence of US peacekeepers to shore up our defense forces us into the position of rebuilding our armies from scratch, training from Dominican communist partisans and Cuban guerilla fighters work tirelessly to aid in this effort, and while the spirit of the Haiti's freedom fighters are to be lionized, it is going to take some time before Haiti can transition from a ramshackle militia into a fully professionalized army."
HAI_Socialist_Economy: "Socialist Economy"
HAI_Socialist_Economy_desc: "The Haitian government has recently directed its efforts towards building a new economy out of the elite playground over which the PRH presided. Good news: staple goods are becoming much cheaper, and economic activity is centred around uplifting the whole of Haitian society. Bad news: limiting exports limits revenue, and Haiti's lack of industrialisation hinders its productive capacity. Such are the pitfalls of an early socialist economy, from which Haiti is attempting to climb out."
HAI_Exiles_and_Enemies: "Exiles and Enemies"
HAI_Exiles_and_Enemies_desc: "Even after the people of Haiti emerged triumphant over the forces of imperialism, detractors to the new regime in Port Au-Prince are seemingly without end; from the US-backed remnants of the last regime, to the far-right nationalists of Duvalier, Yet it doesn't stop there; the limited recognition of the new government, no doubt spurred on by joint American/OFN denunciations, have left Haiti with increasingly few allies to contrast its ever-growing list of enemies, all enough to make our strive for legitimacy in the Caribbean a daunting one indeed."

HIS_HAI.6.t: "Negotiating Positions"
HIS_HAI.6.desc: "When news of Haiti's suspension from the OFN crossed the Resolute Desk, President Nixon's order made his fury clear: "Get me that bastard Lavaud on the line." The State Department scrambled to open communication while Nixon stewed in his seat for hours. Visions of doom flashed in his mind: Haiti falling to Trujillo without American support, the NPP and the press hounding him daily, the pearly smiles of the Kennedys. Subconsciously, he welcomed them.\n\nMorning slouched towards afternoon. His secretary informed him Lavaud was on the phone, and Nixon pounced on the telephone like a hungry beast. "General Lavaud," he began, affecting calm, "this is President Nixon. How do you do?"\n\n"Hello, Mr. President," came a tinny voice. "I am very concerned about the recent decision to suspend Haitian membership in the OFN."\n\n"Well, uh, I'm sure you understand that we're all a little curious about how things went. We're all just wondering what you plan to do now that you've taken power, uh, in a manner that some find concerning. Deeply concerning."\n\n"Please understand, Mr. President, that I—.-" Nixon missed the next few words as he moved the receiver away to mutter "goddamn bastard" before returning to "—ensure that we root out the corruption that weakens our nation."\n\n"Even so, you know, there are some very, uh, very fine fellows among that old guard. If you'd consider keeping some of them in power, and letting the world know that this junta of yours isn't here to stay, I'm sure that the OFN might be willing to reconsider the, uh, their position."\n\n"Mr. President, I cannot. The failure of Puerto Plata lies squarely at their feet, and with an army at our border, Haiti needs stronger leadership.""

HIS_HAI.20.desc: "TOP SECRET/[GetDateText]\nFROM: GERARD DAVIS JR.\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\n\nSUBJECT: DOMINICAN BUILDUP ON HAITIAN BORDER\n\n1. A large formation of armed forces from the Dominican Republic have been spotted on the border with Haiti. This force numbers in the tens of thousands, and is capable of launching an offensive into Haiti with combined arms support. This points to Dictator Rafael Trujillo preparing for an offensive war sometime in the future.\n\n2. Overflights by BIGEYE on X/XX and X/XX brought to our attention a large buildup of Dominican forces in the disputed Hinche region between the two countries. Especially concerning was the construction of many military installations and supply hubs seemingly meant to support offensive operations. SAD reconnaissance missions have confirmed a large number of units have assembled in the area, and many are not in a defensive posture as one would expect normally. \n\n3. This force has not seemed to expand recently, and informants within the government do not expect an imminent invasion. This may mean Trujillo is anticipating a time when his forces could overwhelm Haiti with little to no resistance. However, it is more likely Trujillo has assembled this force in preparation for a time in the future when America is unable to defend Haiti. Many analysts expect the Haitians to last less than a week against the Dominicans if this happens.\n\n4. It is imperative America does not allow Trujillo to think he can strike Haiti with impunity at any time. Our policy in the region should maintain this posture of firm commitment to dissuade any attack. In the meantime the CIA will continue to monitor this deployment for any changes in force levels or structure."

Dominican forces that have been built up on the border with Haiti have been withdrawn. Large numbers of troops, including many armored components, are being moved out of the Hinche area and redeployed across the country. It is highly likely any imminent invasion with Haiti has been canceled.\n\n2. BIGEYE overflights have seen a number of vehicles on trains moving away from the area, and road convoys in the Cordillera Septentrional mountain range. Comparison with previous images have shown a marked reduction in stored supplies and vehicles at various depots in the area, and what units remain seem to be ones kept as a reaction force for a Haitian incursion.\n\n3. On the ground sources have noted a large deployment of troops across the country, consistent with a redeployment of the military from Hinche. Many sources believe the demilitarization is directly linked with the recent death of longtime Dictator Rafael Trujillo. Whether this is to restore order or a genuine effort to deescalate the Hinche issue is unknown at this time. However what can be concluded is an invasion of Haiti is no longer a short term goal for the new government."

HIS_HAI_ugly.1.t: "The Ugly American"
HIS_HAI_ugly.1.desc: ""Employment Opportunities Abroad! Support America Today!" read the handsome signs plastered all over the District of Columbia. The brilliant red letters had been posted on bulletin boards in government offices, university halls, and boarding houses. They made it clear that there was a shortage of trained people to work abroad; that the positions would pay well and take them to see exciting locales around the world; and that they would be doing good and patriotic work to spread freedom abroad.\n\nIt was this last promise that attracted the Ugly American—a name he had long called himself for his rough clothes and dirty hands—to approach the Department of State. He'd attended grand informational sessions hosted by envoys in pristine, arrow-collared shirts and attended night classes with well-groomed men. Between rough work shifts as an engineer, he studied for the foreign service exam in hopes of joining those princes of bureaucracy, of proving himself worthy of advancing causes as high-minded as liberty and equality. He'd taken the test once before and, having heard nothing, was preparing to take it again.\n\nIt was this that he busied himself with as he opened his mailbox after a long day of work. The Ugly American rubbed his oily hands on his pants so as not to stain the building's mailboxes—his super worked so hard to keep them clean—and flipped through the contents. There were bills, restaurant menus, an ad about Richard Nixon. Then, buried at the bottom of the pile, a thick envelope embossed with the Great Seal of the United States. He opened it roughly.\n\n"Congratulations! The scores you received on your Foreign Service Exam qualify you for immediate placement as a political officer in our embassy in Port-au-Prince. To accept this position...""
HIS_HAI_ugly.1.a: "He held the letter with a sense of pride, not caring about the smudges his fingers left behind."
USA_UA_haiti_long_haul_tt: "§eMilitant unrest in Haiti is unlikely to subside quickly, and the United States will be involved in the Haitian War for years to come. Therefore, acting decisively in this conflict is vital, lest American intervention have long-term unforeseen consequences.§!"

HIS_HAI_ugly.2.t: "Ugly Work"
HIS_HAI_ugly.2.desc: "The Ugly American's education before his deployment had been brief. There had been no attempt to get him acquainted with the local language, nor the situation on the ground in Haiti. To the contrary, most of his time in the Department of State's headquarters had been focused on so-called "security briefs"—on ways to protect himself and avoid spies. His best education had, instead, come from trips to the library and congressional reports.\n\nWhich is why he now found himself, implausibly, arguing with a group of soldiers in a village along the Haitian coast. "Now, gentlemen, I'm going to say this once more," he said in a voice that he hoped concealed his frustration. "State asked me to come out here to help build roads and give these people jobs. I've talked to a thousand people about this, gotten the sign-off from local leaders. It's essential to get services running here."\n\nThe leader of the platoon looked at the Ugly Americans disheveled khakis and gave a snide, aristocratic expression. "I'm more worried about my boys being killed in the night than I am about these poor bastards getting roadwork. As I've said before, you can have your project, but only with US-approved contractors and the presence of US troops. Only way to prevent sabotage."\n\nHe resisted throwing his arms out in an expression of frustration. "But you see how that defeats the whole purpose, don't you? It's bad enough to have soldiers putting their guns in people's faces, but there's no jobs, no local ownership of the project if we're getting a bunch of foreign contractors."\n\nBut the man before him was unsympathetic. "Look, I don't know what to tell you. If you want to complain about us protecting American lives, I would encourage you to run it up the chain of command. In the meanwhile..." He pointed to the village. "I'm treating every one of these people as a potential threat.""
HIS_HAI_ugly.2.a: "The Ugly American stood outraged as the soldiers went to patrol the dirt streets, leaving construction equipment fluttering in the breeze."

HIS_HAI_ugly.3.t: "Ugly People"
HIS_HAI_ugly.3.desc: "The Ugly American was aware that he was the only man not wearing a tie. Having just returned from some villages to deliver construction equipment, he found himself in the mansion of the Haitian foreign minister in rough, dirt-flecked khakis surrounded by fashionably dressed men. Were it not for the soldiers standing near the window as guests laughed and drank, one would not be able to tell they were in the middle of a war zone.\n\n"My, my, aren't you a mess," said a  voice. He turned to see an older man in a fine suit sip a martini and flash a small grin. "I do hope wages in the foreign service haven't gotten so bad that men can't afford suits anymore."\n\n"I'm looking for the deputy chief of mission, have you...?"\n\n"Oh, probably smoking some reefers, having a good time. A few of your State Department friends took some women upstairs a while ago if you want to check the bedrooms."\n\nThe American opened his mouth but at that moment there was a loud cheer as a man in military dress uniform opened a bottle of champagne with a saber. White foam slopped out onto the carpet.\n\nThe man studied it quizzically. "You ever think about how hard the people of these places have to work to keep us entertained? The best parties. The best drinks. The best girls. I was in Iraq right before the coup and it was the same thing, except for the Italians." He seemed lost in his thoughts. "I suppose if they stopped having these things then there would be no reason to be here. Just another shithole on the map."\n\nThe Ugly American could no longer hide his disgust. He shook his head and walked away without another word."
HIS_HAI_ugly.3.a: ""Best of luck finding your friend," the man called after him. "There's drinks here when you give up.""  

HIS_HAI_ugly.4.t: "An Ugly Reminder"
HIS_HAI_ugly.4.desc: ""Everything okay?"\n\nThe Ugly American blinked and found himself sitting in a small restaurant in the Tabarre commune of Port-au-Prince. Around him was the quiet chatting of other tables; a mix of middle-class locals and foreign soldiers and diplomats enjoying the  night air. A band played near the street. Across from him sat Marie, a drab woman of twenty-eight who worked as one of the embassy's many secretaries. He supposed this evening together counted as a date.\n\nThe Ugly American gave a solemn smile. "Oh, I'm just a little exhausted. Learning that the business of diplomacy is less hands-on and more ego-driven than I imagined."\n\n"Well, such is life," she said in a dull voice. "It's the way that things have always been. No sense in getting worked up over it."\n\nHe frowned, but before he could say anything, there came the sounds of breaking glass, a shout, and a chair clattering. The American turned to see a waiter crouched over the shattered remains of several glasses as a soldier, clearly drunk, rose. "You fucking stupid..." Began the white man as he stumbled to his feet. The waiter offered a quiet apology, which went unheard, as the other man drew back his leg and kicked the waiter in his chest. He fell backwards in pain. Then the soldier spat out an ugly word.\n\n"That's enough!" said the Ugly American, rising from the table. He walked forward. "You have no right to treat this man, or any other Haitian this way. We came here to give these people freedom. Every act of violence dishonors the uniform—."\n\nHe did not get out the rest of the words as the man's fist connected with his face. There was shocked silence as he toppled into a nearby table and onto the floor. The taste of blood filled his mouth. He caught a glance of Marie at the table, looking away, as the drunk man stepped toward him and leaned down."
HIS_HAI_ugly.4.a: ""I'll do whatever the fuck I want," he spat, "Then the feds are going to clean it up. Don't forget that.""

HIS_HAI_ugly.5.t: "Ugly Requests"
HIS_HAI_ugly.5.desc: "It would be one thing if the injury was superficial, a matter of appearance, but the Ugly American's jaw was still tender from his ill-fated date with Marie. Every time he opened his mouth, a sharp feeling of pain shot through him. Worse, it made it difficult for him to talk at a time when he needed his mouth more than ever. The Department had announced it would be surveying the country's entire population to better distribute aid and "reduce fraud." Any villages that were not fully surveyed risked losing access to food, money, and material. And with so many of his colleagues hiding away in the embassy to avoid security threats, he'd forced himself to work, alone, through the pain.\n\n"Bonjour, monsieur," said the Ugly American. Between his injury-induced lisp and broken French, he felt like a child.  "Je suis un americain avec... le gouvernement. Je voudrais... demander quelques questions à ta famille."\n\nThe young man in front of him gave a look of either boredom or contempt. The Ugly American tried to repeat. "Je voudrais..."\n\nThe Haitian looked around the quiet dirt road. As other villagers went about their duties, a few GIs leaned against their Jeep and chatted. He looked at the empty house behind him.\n\n"Yes, American. I will answer questions. With family. Come," said the man, gesturing toward the building.\n\nThe Ugly American paused. He wasn't supposed to go alone into buildings alone like this, but his experiences thus far had been peaceful. He'd encountered some hostility—the usual, anti-American rallies and slogans—but nothing on the level that his security briefing had warned, nor—rubbing his jaw—anything he couldn't on some level understand."
HIS_HAI_ugly.5.a: "The young man gestured to him in the doorway. With a sigh, the Ugly American followed."

HIS_HAI_ugly.6.t: "Ugly Consequences"
HIS_HAI_ugly.6.desc: "He knew he had made a mistake the moment he'd entered the building. Instead of being greeted by the man, by a small family, The Ugly American felt something cold, metal, and sharp press against the exposed flesh near his neck.\n\n"Do not scream," said the man.\n\nThe Ugly American raised his dirty hands in surrender, census forms still gripped in his palm. He caught the gleam of a knife inside the dark room as the man moved to check the Ugly American's pockets, removing his wallet and leafing through it.\n\n"Please," said the Ugly American in a quiet voice. The man removed a wad of cash from his wallet. "I'm unarmed. I'm only here for a survey. I'm only here to help."\n\nThe man discarded the emptied wallet. "Help? You butcher us, treat us like dogs, and you call it help?" He spat onto the floor. The knife wavered. "We still talk of the Gendarmerie, of the prostitutes and gangsters you forced on us. Even now, your banks and companies come to pillage. Is that not true?\n\n"I'm not... I don't..."\n\n"You don't know." The man repeated it flatly. He lowered his knife and stared at the American with an expression of unadulterated loathing. "You come here, expecting to be the hero, and you do not know your own his—."\n\nHe did not get any further. The Ugly American chucked his collection of survey forms at the Haitian. Paperwork scattered across the room like confetti. The man stepped back in surprise as the Ugly American turned, sprinting from the building and screaming as loud as his damaged jaw would allow him."
HIS_HAI_ugly.6.a: "When he returned with the GIs, all he found were scattered papers and his empty wallet."

HIS_HAI_ugly.7.t: "Ugly Thoughts"
HIS_HAI_ugly.7.desc: "It had been several days since the incident in the village and—with violence escalating and the Ugly American still waking from nightmares about the cold blade against his flesh—his superiors had decided that he and his colleagues should avoid field work for the time being. Instead, the State Department would revert to playing a "vital support role" for a "new phase in America's engagement with its Haitian partners." In practice, this meant playing the bag man for the US military.\n\n"Welcome to Port-au-Prince, gentlemen," shouted the Ugly American over the rain and whipping wind. He was standing near the tarmac at Port-au-Prince International Airport, struggling to keep hold of the umbrella in his slick hands, while transport aircrafts landed one after the other. Pouring from them came young boys, some of them looking too young for their uniforms.\n\nA man in a soaked uniform shook the Ugly American's hand. "I wish I could say it was a pleasure." He yelled, before flashing a smile. "Let's hope this weather isn't a bad omen."\n\nThe Ugly American smiled to pretend he found the joke amusing. "Once you're settled, the Ambassador has requested to see you at his residence to discuss the current challenges. He imagines..."\n\nIt went on. The Ugly American could feel his mouth moving as he spat out bureaucratic platitudes about the "security situation" and "on-the-ground assessments." Inside, though, he felt dismal. This was not what he had seen himself doing when he first arrived. He did not imagine himself as an agent of empire, greeting young boys and leading them to their deaths. He had come here with the stupid, child-like hope of making a difference.\n\nThe Ugly American and the officer walked to a car. He then opened the door for the man and gestured to him to go inside. They talked politely on their way to the embassy."
HIS_HAI_ugly.7.a: "The rain had begun to wipe the grime from his fingers."

HIS_HAI_ugly.8.t: "Ugly Scenes"
HIS_HAI_ugly.8.desc: "The Ugly American felt his lunch lurch inside his belly as the helicopter took off from the base near the airport. Port-au-Prince shrunk and took on a plastic, model-like sheen. Miniature cars zipped along roads that turned from asphalt to dirt. Then he was looking over barren hills, small towns splattered across them.\n\n"You see that?" Shouted his companion, pointing somewhere near the horizon. "We've gotten word that some of Fred Batiste's red army are hiding out there." The chopper rattled. The man directed his attention downward, toward a unit of American and Haitian soldiers. They looked like toy soldiers against the green. "This'll be a good mission for them to test our coordination."\n\nThe Ugly American nodded as if he understood any of this. He gripped the passenger handle tight. He would be happier when this ordeal was over and he could report back to the deputy chief of mission that the security situation had improved enough that they could do field work again.\n\n"They'll be making contact. You'll wanna to watch closely."\n\nThe Ugly American forced himself to stare down at the unit of Americans and Haitians. They got within a few yards of the village and then cracks rang out across the hillside. The smile fell from his companion's face. "Jesus fucking Christ."\n\nBelow them, the men collapsed. Mists of red could be seen as, one by one, they fell to some unseen enemy. Several men fired into empty space before collapsing into the dirt. He watched, powerless, as one boy, a pale thing, threw down his rifle and attempted a retreat before his skull shattered. Then, there came the sounds of rounds hitting the bottom of their helicopter.\n\n"Fuck. Abort! Abort! Get us the fuck out of here!""
HIS_HAI_ugly.8.a: "The Ugly American held it as long as he could before vomiting over his bulletproof vest."

HIS_HAI_ugly.9.t: "Ugly Developments"
HIS_HAI_ugly.9.desc: "With its high exterior walls and sealed windows, the Ugly American had always thought of the American embassy in Port-au-Prince as a fortress, a source of protection for the hard-working people of the State Department. After several disastrous events, including his own ill-fated helicopter ride, he now saw it as a prison. Staff had long-since ceased to interact with anyone in the host country and instead walked the same few halls over and over again. He had started seeing Marie again, not because of some great feeling of love, but to ward off boredom and apathy and find an excuse to get away from his desk.\n\n"Sir," came a voice from nearby. "I have a summary of those DoD operation reports you asked for."\n\nHe stirred from his thoughts and looked up to see... Carter? Chester? All the names had started to blur together in his brain. All the Ugly American knew was that the man had arrived two weeks ago, was visibly a decade younger than anyone else, and was the son or nephew of a sitting member of Congress. He'd been put in charge of "onboarding" the kid which, in this case, meant asking him to evaluate how the new military-oriented "engagement" was going so that he, in turn, could write a diplomatic cable back to Washington.\n\nThe Ugly American forced himself to give a smile of thanks. Then he opened the small packet of papers to... He could feel his face blanche. Hidden beneath the most bureaucratic legalese were reports of atrocities. There was no escaping it. American advisors had "eliminated targets." Entire villages had been "relocated" to address "active threats to personnel." There were regular "incidents" of violence, not enacted by a handful of crazed, irrational soldiers, but enabled by a system acting to eradicate an insurgency. His hands, rendered clean from a lack of hard labor, gripped the papers tight.\n\n"Sir," said the boy prince, seeming far away, "are you alright?""
HIS_HAI_ugly.9.a: ""Just...leave me. I need a moment before I take care of this.""

HIS_HAI_ugly.10.t: "Ugly Words"
HIS_HAI_ugly.10.desc: "He had turned down an invitation by Marie to visit her in the embassy compound. He had turned down a small retirement party for his deputy head of mission. It was late at night and the Ugly American was sitting, staring at the half-written letter in the typewriter on his desk.\n\n"Mr. Ambassador, I am enclosing a copy of my letter of resignation from my position in the Department of State. Over the past few weeks, I have lost confidence in the integrity of our work here and the ability of the United States to affect positive change for the Haitian people. I hope that by resigning—."\n\nThe letter cut off there. It was what he had been struggling with for the past hour. What did he hope to accomplish? Did he think Department leadership would take his actions as a brave stand against injustice? (No.) Did he hope to rally his colleagues to demand something better? (No.) Did he think he would be saving anyone but himself from the violence that was, even now, being inflicted in the streets in the name of liberty and justice? (No.)\n\nHe buried his head in his hands. The only thing his resignation would achieve would be to let the Department fill his post with someone new. Maybe that person would be better than he was, stronger and more clever and more able to stand up against clear wrong-doing. More likely than not, though, they would bring in another prince of bureaucracy, a person who wore fine shirts and had clean hands because he had never worked a day in his life. He had to see this through. He had to try.\n\nThe Ugly American removed the letter from the typewriter, crumpled it, and threw it into his trash bin. Then, wordlessly, he picked up the summary report that Chester had brought him and began to draft a cable back to Washington."

I..."\n\nDressed in his clean, white-collar shirt, the Ugly American sat on a table in the back storage room and stared at the ceiling.  "It's not your fault. It's just... whenever I look at you, I think of how we've failed here and doomed this country."\n\n"I remind you of how we've failed here?" There was silence. "Me?" She gave a bitter laugh. "Oh, that's rich, coming from you."\n\nHe felt his face grow hot. "I actually try to make a difference here. I work hard. I get my hands dirty."\n\n"My God, are you so egocentric that you believe you're the only person trying their best to salvage something from this disaster?

Had some hapless staffer in Foggy Bottom read his cables? Was it merely because he looked like the picture of an American Boy Scout and his picture would be useful for campaign ads?\n\nThe Ugly American didn't know. All he was aware of was that he and a spattering of other verifiable princes of bureaucracy had been lined up against the wall of the White House's East Room. He wore a fine suit and pristine, arrow-collared shirt while press cameras flashed and the president spoke about hard work and decency and the triumph of the American spirit. There was a moment—after explaining the achievements of the other awardees—when the president said his name. The president praised him as a paragon of a foreign service officer, where he lauded  his work advancing the cause of liberty and empowering the Haitian people.\n\nHe didn't care.\n\n"Good job, son," said President [GetPresidentLastName] as he went down the line. He squeezed his shoulder and pressed a certificate into his hand.  "You've got a bright future."\n\nThen it was over. The president exited and the press put away their cameras. Several staffers escorted him out of the building. He would go to a party and a hotel and have meaningless conversations that had nothing to do with the violence that was, even now, being inflicted by the United States all over the world. They would laugh and chuckle and sing happy songs, ignoring the mountain of bones on which American power all stood."

He and others had received notices that their positions at the embassy had been terminated and they would be reassigned to a different posting as soon as a position opened.\n\nThe Ugly American kept his face stiff as he walked the embassy compound's emptied corridors, making sure to avoid the desk where Marie and the other secretaries worked. He filled boxes full of documents to be destroyed—Chester's report on US atrocities, his crumpled, half-completed resignation letter, scattered survey forms, and the prescription for painkillers he'd received for his jaw. He did not react as the boxes containing the legacy of his time in Haiti were loaded into an incinerator and destroyed.\n\nIt was better this way, he thought. What little he had achieved was unlikely to survive the rapid withdrawal of the US military. It was unlikely that the angry throngs outside, waving Haitian flags and chanting anti-American slogans, would view any record of his time here favorably.\n\nNot that he thought there was anything people should celebrate.\n\nWhen all traces of himself had all been destroyed, the Ugly American went to the roof of the embassy and boarded one of the last helicopters out of Port-au-Prince. As it took off, he kept his gaze affixed on the horizon so as not to catch sight of the people he had failed."

All that remained now were the staff of the American embassy and the remnants of the US military, reduced to defending Port-au-Prince International Airport.\n\nThe Ugly American had just finished loading Chester's report on atrocities into a burn bag when a man in fatigues opened the door to one of the embassy's back storage room. His face looked wild, panicked. "We have to go now."\n\nHe entered the garage in time to see Marie vanish into the back of a truck, a terrified look on her face. Then felt himself being hurried along to the truck behind her. He had a second to shut the door before it shot out onto the crowded streets, through yelling, terrified people begging for escape, for refuge. The Ugly American watched as a young man threw himself onto the side of his vehicle, only to be thrown off as it turned a corner. Once lively shops were sealed and barren as their owners hid from the PPLN. A long banner displaying the face of the now-vanished Haitian president fluttered in the breeze.\n\nHis driver turned back to look at him. "We shouldn't be much further now. Once you see the airport terminal, get your ass in gear to—."\n\nHe did not hear the rest. There was a series of loud thunks, followed by the sound of breaking glass, as bullets exploded through the front window. The man slumped forward in his seat over the steering wheel. The Ugly American was aware of the car drifting, of it accelerating at an alarming speed, of a group of men carrying a red flag near the end of the road. He had no time to think as he unbuckled himself from the back seat, threw the trunk door open, and lept from it."

Protruding from the skin was his pale—.\n\nHe sat up as vomit forced its way up his throat and burned his lips. He heaved again.

A small group of men with rifles were rifling through the ruin, too concerned with searching it to notice him.\n\nHe wobbled to his feet.\n\nHe waited a moment to see if he would be spotted.\n\nThen he began to stumble away, back toward the city.\n\nHow long it took, he couldn't say. Time folded into itself. For the first time since he had arrived in Port-au-Prince all those years ago, though, the streets were strangely quiet and empty. There was no more music, no more celebrations. No other foreigners walked the streets. All those things that he and his colleagues had supported were gone.\n\nWhen he could walk no longer, he found himself standing before an enormous, dilapidated billboard. It displayed an American flag and the faces of many smiling people. Written on it, in English and Creole, was a simple phrase in handsome lettering."

HIS_HAI_ugly.16.desc: "In the end, the visit to the White House had been the end of the party. He had gone back to the embassy in Port-au-Prince. He had filed his cables and his paperwork as security forces struggled to combat the Haitian red army, the forces of Fred Baptiste. There had been struggles, challenges, as Washington grew alarmed at the developments emerging from Haiti and then gave up. A solution to the crisis had been found, but not one Washington desired and not one that addressed underlying insecurities or the actions Americans had taken across the island.\n\nA soft hand pressed against his shoulder. A set of lips pecked him on the cheek. "You alright, darling? You have that face again."\n\nThe Ugly American turned from the television in his DC apartment to his girlfriend. He reached up his rough hand and caressed her cheek as the president intoned about America's commitment to its Caribbean allies and its continued support to Haiti as the country. "Yes, Mary-Beth, I'm alright. Just thinking about the next deployment."\n\nShe kissed him again and left to finish cooking in the kitchen. He returned his attention to the screen. President [GetPresidentLastName] stood in the Rose Garden, their body shimmering in the midday sun. "In our time in Haiti, we never once sacrificed our principles for expediency, never once forgot what we were there for. We sought to prove that America can be a force for good in the world and promote justice wherever it goes. What we must learn from this is—."\n\nThe Ugly American turned off the television in disgust. His own ugly reflection stared back at him."

You already know what we did and didn't do. All POTUS is gonna say is gonna be the 50,000-foot-view, whatever you reported filtered through a million stuffed shirts."\n\n"But still," the Ugly American sighed to his new colleague in the US consulate in Montreal, his first posting since the end of his deployment in Haiti, "we have to represent US policy and it's important that we can talk specifics about the address if people ask about it."\n\nHis fellow diplomat threw up a hand in protest but did not resist as the Ugly American turned up the radio situated between their desks. He made sure to keep his face flat and unemotive as he did so, to be the picture of American professionalism. He took out a pen to take notes.\n\n"With the victory of Republican forces in Haiti, what we see is a renewed commitment to our founding principles," said the president through static. "We see that America is a force for good, a force for justice. With minimal investment, we were able to shepherd our Haitian allies into the family of democracies and guarantee the human rights and livelihoods of millions..."\n\n"Hey! Hey!" shouted The Ugly American's colleague in sudden alarm. "Your pen! Jesus Christ, your pen."\n\nThe Ugly American broke from his stupor and looked down to see that he had snapped his pen clean in half. Dark red rivulets coursed from the broken tube and soaked his coarse hands."

"The Dominicans are formally requesting the Organization of American States to mediate, with the U.S. providing its good offices in support."\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] sighed.

HIS_hinche_negotiations.3.desc: "When the Haitian and Dominican representatives had finished their initial presentations in the hotel conference room in Miami, staring daggers at each other despite the genteel words exchanged, the American moderators decided that it was time to take a break.\n\nThe entire presentation from the Haitian government had been a litany of slights and offenses committed by the Dominican Republic, a history of mistrust and anger dating back to the Parsley Massacre and before. The Dominicans could not be trusted to keep their word, much less a vital piece of rightful Haitian territory in the Hinche, a foothold into sovereign and immutable Haitian territory; so help them God, they would have Hinche or Hispaniola would know no peace.\n\nThe Dominican representative played the role of the bewildered, deflecting adult - blaming the Haitians for escalating a dispute that could be solved between the two of them alone, when it was clear that the Dominican government had shown no interest in resolving the matter for decades. Haiti, to them, was blowing things well out of proportion - a statement that neatly sidestepped any question of Hinche's rightful owner.\n\nThey would not be able to resolve the issue by themselves - nor would they need to, if America was willing to make the choice for them. That had been Haiti's hope, and that was now the Dominican Republic's hope as well."

Opposite him, the Dominican and American delegations sat impassively, keeping their expressions as neutral as possible.\n\nThe American decision to favor the Dominicans keeping Hinche had, predictably, detonated the talks - and nobody had expected the Haitians to go quietly. If letting the Haitians vent was the cost of staying this course, then the Americans - and obviously, the Dominicans - were prepared to pay it.\n\n"We brought this dispute to you in good faith, confident in the righteous, historical facts of our cause. To see America rely on the arguments of the present to justify an unjust past, condemns Hispaniola to a dark future."\n\nThe appeals to the law had turned to an appeal to emotions. The moderator, having decided to let the Haitians have the floor until they exhausted themselves, raised no objection to the Haitian filibuster, letting the representative's words hang in the air.\n\n"If our grievances cannot be heard fairly, then we must regretfully consider that our trust in the United States has been misplaced. Our government will consider its remaining available options to satisfy the people of Haiti."\n\nAnd there was the threat - the fact that in international politics, everyone got a vote, even if they didn't always get to choose where to exercise it.

Now, the Dominican representative was stubbornly refusing to accept the American proposal - to give Hinche to the Haitians - until they were blue in the face. The Haitians, for their part, were close to throwing up their hands and storming out - arguing that they hadn't expected anything more from the Dominicans, but at least the Americans now knew what the had known for years.\n\nThe State Department diplomats called for another break. With the talks on the verge of breaking down, and having already weighed in on the Haitian side, a few argued that salvaging the talks would require some kind of inducement to the Dominicans - an offer of development assistance, far more generous than any package previously offered, with individual 'packages' for key leaders. It would be a win-win package of the most expensive kind, but it would hopefully work.\n\nOnly for some new dispute or grievance to spring up and start the process again, others argued.

This, the Americans had insisted be done with the Haitians outside the room - so as to allow the Dominicans to save some face.\n\nWhen the dollar figures grew too large, the Americans allowed the other, more blunt instrument of diplomacy to take center stage.

With relations with the Dominican Republic unlikely to recover, all that remained would be to ensure that the Haitian side of Hispaniola gleamed where the Dominican Republic languished, so that nobody would question the wisdom of having sided with the Haitians.\n\nThe Haitians had no objections - they had, after all, gotten what they wanted."

PPLN_Government_of_the_Alliance_Generale_desc: "The PPLN would never claim to be the dominant partner in the revolutionary alliance, but as its most organised organisation, the PPLN occupies a position of authority. To offset this privilege, they make efforts to cooperate with fellow revolutionaries and accommodate their interests in the wider project. Nonetheless, there is a growing point of contention in the front with Jacques-Stephen Alexis' noirism, which centres culture, not class, as the fundamental issue of Haitian society."
PPLN_Army_of_Insurgents: "Army of Insurgents"
PPLN_Army_of_Insurgents_desc: "Like every great socialist uprising throughout history, the PPLN's revolutionary army has begun as a ragtag alliance of militia conscripts and defectors from the Haitian Armed Forces. Rather than a single army spread across the country, it is composed of several regional armies that take orders from the Central Committee, allowing a degree of flexibility.\n\nHowever, the new revolutionary army is not without growing pains - due to suboptimal communication and poor organization of supply lines, coordination is difficult, with many independent squads of guerrillas - such as the one headed by the infamous Fred Baptiste  - acting directly outside of the chain of command. Nonetheless, time and experience will doubtlessly remedy these issues, if the Central Committee has anything to say about it."
PPLN_Mass_Revolutionary_Movement: "Mass Revolutionary Movement"
PPLN_Mass_Revolutionary_Movement_desc: "It is a point of pride within the PPLN that their movement is one with mass appeal in Haiti, accommodating all aspects of society unseen and disregarded by the elites in Port-au-Prince. It is a movement that speaks to the working class' grievances, the oppression of non-Haitians, and the growing calls for black nationalism against mulatto supremacy. Whatever your cause, the PPLN has a space for you in an ideological front against the Haitian bourgeoisie government."

PPLN_Through_the_Hinche_Highway_desc: "The change in fortune of the PPLN after the Dominican Revolution, which created a fledgling nation of revolutionaries right on the border, was unexpected but not unwelcome. Our brothers and sisters in Hinche, located in the interior, have given us a haven and a steady supply of volunteers, guns, and supplies. From our stronghold there, we are granted an even better position from which we may reclaim Haiti, alongside our comrades-in-arms."

# Leader descs
POLITICS_RAFAEL_TRUJILLO_DESC: "With the Caudillismo of the 20s bringing the country to its knees, Rafael Trujillo would usher in a new age with his coup in 1930, 'la Era de Trujillo'. Bringing political stability and economic prosperity, casting off the influence of the Americans from the Republic and bringing it closer with Iberia and Italy, true allies of the state and its people, the new regime would become widely popular with the people, with Trujillo being seen by many as El Benefactor.\n\nHowever, all this stability and prosperity would be built on top of the bodies of the ones who opposed the tyrannical and brutal regime of Trujillo. Be from within, those who opposed the dictator and found themselves sent to prisions to be tortured to death, or from without, the Haitians that were unlucky enough to to be born in the regions claimed by Trujillo, either killed or forced to flee their homes in the fear of it.\n\nFor decades the Secret Police and Army were able to keep these enemies of the Republic at bay, however, with the fall of Batista in Cuba the safety of the regime would be called into question as the rebellion against him had come with US support. With fears that he will be next, Trujillo has continuously built up his military and security apparatus with Iberian and Italian help, turning the Dominican Republic into a fortress for Fascism, all the while backing anti-American movements wherever possible. With everyone knowing that action against him is a guarantee, the only question remaining is if the regime will be able to survive."
POLITICS_RAMFIS_TRUJILLO_DESC: "Growing up the son of the man who built the modern Dominican State, many expected great things from Rafael Leónidas 'Ramfis' Trujillo. It's not like his father wasn't aware of this either, giving him military promotions and bridges in his name at an extraordinarily young age. He was long considered the heir apparent, and many expected him to take the political acumen of his father.\n\nOf course, Ramfis turned out to fall far from the tree. He never showed interest in politics, or not nearly as much as he had for young women and auto racing. His failure to graduate the Academia General Militar due to his focus on extravagant affairs with movie actresses was a source of embarrassment to the regime. And a scandalous divorce from his first wife led to him falling out of the public eye for quite a while, though it never dampened his bohemian lifestyle. When they hear his name, many Dominicans think of him with a dark haired starlet in a fancy automobile instead of at his father's side in a uniform, and they laugh.\n\nBut Ramfis heard these laughs. And if there's anything he's inherited from his father, it's his insecurity. He knows they're wrong, that he can be a great leader like his father was. And anyone who doubts him will be proven wrong... or dealt with."

He never showed interest in politics, or not nearly as much as he had for young women and luxury auto racing. So when it came time for him to take the reins, he was offered a deal he could not refuse from the Military Intelligence Service. Ramfis could have as many luxury cars, movie stars, and benders as he wanted. And if he needed to slit a throat, he only had to name it. But the real power is Chief Johnny Abbes García.\n\nAbbes is rumored to be another product of nepotism, to have traded affairs as a young man with the former President to advance his career. But while the power behind the throne is corrupt, he was always loyal to Trujillo, and wants nothing more than to advance the will of the departed ruler. So Ramfis can live happily the way he always wanted, the burden of power on Abbes, his agents, and the German handlers behind them all."
POLITICS_JOAQUIN_BALAGUER_DESC: "If someone told Joaquín Balaguer's family and neighbours in the poor ruralities of Santiago de los Caballeros that he would rise to the Presidency of the Dominican Republic after years of quiet struggle and effort, they would laugh in their interlocutor's face. But that is how it has played out.\n\nAmerican occupation and the rhetoric of his father's friend, the leader of the Puerto Rican liberation struggle Pedro Albizu Campos, sparked in the young Balaguer a love for intellectual debate and its frequent companion of politics. That, combined with training in essay writing and law, made him the perfect candidate for public prosecutor. Balaguer would've been content to do that for a while had an opportunity not struck—for not long after Balaguer's tenure began, his cousin married the future ruler of the Dominican Republic, Rafael Leónidas Trujillo.\n\nThings began well. Balaguer was Trujillo's most important minister, his closest confidant. He kept a low profile, and said nothing about Trujillo's aberrations and excesses. But this happy equilibrium went to hell quickly as Trujillo himself became a liability and a threat to the country he had built. So Balaguer had no choice but to preserve his old friend's work—by orchestrating his assassination.\n\nLet there be no mistake: the rise of Balaguer is the transition of the Dominican Republic towards a safer, more moderate paradigm. Yet not all is well, and the new President knows to watch himself; as he often says, for every grateful civilian these days there seem to be at least just as many crypto-communists who can't be satisfied with what they've gotten. They cannot be allowed to destroy all that Balaguer has worked for. Absolutely not."

But getting revolutionaries to agree on killing Trujillo was the easy part. The hard part, that of defining the Dominican Republic's future, is only beginning.\n\nIn theory, the government is clearly delineated. The Provisional President of the Dominican Republic is the old revolutionary Horacio Ornes, and he presides over the reconstruction of the post-Trujillo state. All law-decrees and orders are signed by him at the request of the Government of National Reconstruction.\n\nHowever, in reality Ornes' authority is not so clear-cut: the Government of National Reconstruction rules by consensus of its disparate members. But the Dominican revolutionaries and their Caribbean Legion allies have a thousand contradicting worldviews and ideologies and so that "consensus" has been collapsing from the very moment Trujillo was thrown into his unmarked grave.\n\nThe top priority of the Ornes presidency is to stabilize Quisqueya's politics enough to be able to hold elections in peace. But the more one observes that presidency in its deliberations, the less certainty one has that that will be an easy, smoothly executed task."

DOM_Dios_Trujillo_desc: "The popularity of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina cannot be understated. To those old enough to remember the poverty and chaos of the 1920s, he is the savior of the nation. To those who are younger, he is the protector of the Dominicans from American imperialism and Haitian barbarism. While there are plenty who see him as nothing more than a brute, the motto of 'Dios y Trujillo' is plastered across the nation, often below his portrait. To many Dominicans, God and Trujillo are one and the same."

DOM_Dios_Trujillo_ramfis_desc: "The notoriety of Rafael 'Ramfis' Trujillo cannot be understated. A hedonist and a dilettante; the Dominican Republic is full of sordid stories of his luxurious lifestyle, supported by the brutal regime his father left him. Despite his lack of drive, he has an ambition to be seen as an equal to his father. While there are plenty who see him as nothing more than a puppet and a playboy, Ramfis seeks to change this. To many Dominicans, God and Trujillo shall once again be one and the same."

DOM_Blanqueamiento: "Blanqueamiento"
DOM_Blanqueamiento_desc: "Under Trujillo, the Dominican Republic has undertaken a particularly notable initiative, the Blanqueamiento, or 'Whitening'. Believing that Spanish White culture stands as the beacon that civilized the primitives of the region, the Dominican Republic took in Republican refugees fleeing from the Spanish Civil War despite his own ideological and political proximity to the Nationalists, and also, surprisingly, Jewish refugees fleeing the advances of the Nazis during the Second World War.\n\nThis, however, would only be the first step. After the end of the conflict, Trujillo has pursued closer ties with Franco and pushed for trade, cultural and, most importantly, emigration accords with the peninsula. While these initiatives have proven themselves successful, with Iberians moving to the island in droves, they would still not make much of a dent in the largely mulatto and black population.\n\nAs a response to growing tensions with immigrant whites, his regime began pushing for xenophobic propaganda targeting Haitians, promoting discrimination against the overwhelming number of Haitian blacks living in the country. These have resulted in a number of pogroms and the expulsion of Haitians from border communities, artificially increasing the percentage occupied by the whites in the process."

However, these forces are weak and scattered after a nationwide crackdown in 1959, led by the intelligence services in the wake of the Cuban Revolution, saw most resistance leaders thrown into prison. While rebel cells exist, they desperately need help in order to achieve their goals.\n\nDespite this a general uneasiness with the regime is spreading, from the younger generations wishing for change, to the older ones growing frustrated with the scandalous abuses of the Trujillo family and their close circle, to even hushed whispers in the barracks as officers tire of the moral debauchery of which the regime knows no limits."

POLITICS_ALBERTO_BAYO_DESC: "This is not Alberto Bayo's first war, not by a long shot. Nor is it the first conflict he's seen. At birth, his homeland was Spanish Cuba. He moved to Spain afterwards; when the fascists attacked it, he defied them to the end.\n\nIt has been two decades since Bayo led the failed Spanish Republican operation to reclaim Mallorca—though his men initially succeeded, and believed firmly in an assurance of victory, the Nationalists held on long enough for the Italians to intervene, and for the fascist axis to drive the Republicans back, cutting them down as they fled.\n\nAs had played out too many times beforehand, Bayo was disgraced and stripped from almost all his roles, relegated to the background for the rest of the war. Establishing himself in Mexico and having a brief, inconsequential stint at the Mexican military academy, he lived a life of poverty as a furniture-maker until revolutionaries Ernesto Guevara and Fidel Castro sought him out.\n\nThat was Bayo's first big break, a real, honest-to-God success. Training Guevara and Castro in guerrilla tactics, he joined them in the Granma landing and stayed with them until the Revolution proved victorious—a triumph in which his role proved pivotal. It was in those circumstances that the old revolutionary, now a general of the Cuban army, returned to his birthplace.\n\nNow it is not Cuba or Mallorca, but Quisqueya that is in question. Bayo has grown wise with age, and learned from his mistakes. But he cannot shake the fear that he is similarly placed to the failed operation that cost him everything nearly three decades ago. He cannot—will not—make the same mistake again."
POLITICS_HORACIO_ORNES_DESC: "Horacio Ornes has come far, far indeed, since the hell he went through in the Cibao Mountains after the Disaster of the Luperón Landing in 1959.\n\nIn those lands the locals were hostile and results were few and far between; the cities, however, proved to be ripe with dissidents sick of Trujillo's tyranny. It was those same cities that proved the ideal place to lay the groundwork for the uprising which has now destroyed Trujillo-though the work is not yet done, for the Tyrant's running dogs are still in power in Santo Domingo.\n\nAlmost from his birth in 1922 in Puerto Plata, Ornes seemed fated to fight against the tyranny of the regime. First he was a dissident lawyer and writer, then he exiled himself in order to help extirpate tyranny in all its forms across the Caribbean. But the Cayo Confites Expedition of 1947 failed—what had been meant to attack Trujillo instead ended up getting Cuba and La Habana bombed. The next year the Caribbean Legion split in two, and Fidel Castro's young guard formed the Second Legion; Ornes reluctantly joined them, and struggled for six years in the Cuban mountains.\n\nNow is the time for Ornes to fulfill what he has worked for all this time. His lifelong goal is within grasp, and he will lay everything on the line in this final attempt."

HIS_puertoplata.1.desc: "CONFIDENTIAL\n\nTO: DOCTOR ANTÓNIO OLIVEIRA SALAZAR, GENERALÍSIMO FRANCISCO FRANCO\n\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC - STRATEGIC ALLY IN THE CARIBBEAN\n\nWith the collapse of the Triumvirate, the main lifeline of the Dominican Republic was severed. Out of concern for the continued security of the state, and viewing Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo's position as vulnerable, a small group of generals within the Armed Forces plotted a coup d'état. The plot was quickly discovered by government intelligence agencies within the last week and was broken up, with little difficulty and no known foreign support.\n\nThis is the first of this kind of plot in over a decade, frequently occurring in the past when Trujillo had not yet consolidated. However, recent events have increased the threat posed by these plots. Several nations within the region are hostile to the regime: Mexico and Venezuela have antagonized it for a long time, and recent events in Cuba have turned them into a centre of anti-Trujillo organization, not to mention the active opposition that the United States has presented since the end of the War. Trujillo has privately expressed concern over future plots receiving backing from said nations, and the chance that they may eventually succeed.\n\nIt is imperative that Trujillo remains in power. The Dominican Republic is currently our closest ally within Latin America, and the efforts of Rafael Trujillo play a key part in our strategic interests. With the collapse of the Triumvirate, many view his government's position as isolated barring for our presence. If his regime were to collapse due to outside pressure, the likely replacements will be far less open to collaboration. Extra attention shall be focused on the nation, and it would be recommended that additional support should be given to the state openly, to improve perceptions of its diplomatic standing.\n\nFrom the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."

HIS_puertoplata.2.desc: "TOP SECRET - [GetDateText]\nFROM: EXECUTIVE SECRETARIAT\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\nSUBJECT: INSTABILITY WITHIN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC\n\nRecent upheavals geopolitically have left the regime of Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo weak. An abortive coup plot attained some momentum shortly after the collapse of the Triumvirate, but was ultimately crushed. Whilst this coup failed, it indicates a shift in trend for Dominican politics. Other coup plots, particularly those that are more organised, seem likely. Furthermore, the nation's diplomatic standing remains isolated barring the presence of Iberia. Efforts to improve relations with nearby nations are unlikely, considering the regime has turned into a pariah state throughout the past decade.\n\nSeveral agents in the field have used their connections with loyal officials in portions of the Dominican Republic to uncover the failed coup. The response was a minor purge, which has concerned some officials. In Cuba, plans to aid the Caribbean Legion in replacing Trujillo are underway (Read attached for more info). Continued military presence from Dominican forces on the Haitian border suggest that foreign policy remains unchanged.\n\nIt is imperative that we ensure that the regime governed by Trujillo is replaced. Most local opposition is broadly unified against Trujillo's sympathetic behaviour to Fascist and anti-American regimes in Europe and Latin America. Such opposition is also sympathetic to us, or to Cuba and Mexico. In combatting Trujillo, agents have been sent over to provide aid to insurgents and organize them for the Legion's planned offensive. Agents are also currently organising opposition within the Dominican military, with some success."

These agents were given the task of counterespionage, in order to discover any potential plots to overthrow Rafael Trujillo's government. Recent findings suggest that the risk of a foreign-backed plot to remove Trujillo are correct.\n\nThrough a mixture of intimidation, interception, and bribery, our agents have managed to partially infiltrate a group of 2,000 soldiers belonging to the Caribbean Legion, receiving training in amphibious landing and drilled in combat, and is composed mostly of political dissidents who left the nation in recent years, along with volunteers from Cuba and abroad. There is little reason to doubt that they are preparing for an attack against the Dominican Republic, especially with patterns of recent attacks from insurgent cells targeting several coastal regions.\n\nThis is a major deterioration in prospects for the Dominican Republic, and a government similar to that of Cuba would doubtlessly be hostile to us, not to mention it would jeopardize our interests in Latin America as a whole. The Dominican government has been promptly warned of the threat, and is preparing for a major, sudden war. Beyond this, the intensity of our efforts to uncover the Legion's plans will likely prevent future advances without putting our agents at heightened, unneeded risks. Several contingency plans have been prepared for an event of this manner, and should be executed immediately."

The United States, in coordination with Cuba and Mexico are currently training a small contingent of the Carribean Legion, which has taken a direct stance in opposition to dictatorial regimes in the region. With reports of amphibious operations training, it seems likely that they plan to attack through sea, and will link up with dissidents and insurgent forces within to attempt to stage a popular revolution.\n\nWithin recent events, Iberia has become the sole backer of the Dominican Republic. It seems likely that they have discovered the plans of the Americans and Cubans as well, with a heightened presence of known security agents. Santo Domingo is neutral in regards to policy directed at us, and Iberia is hostile. It seems unlikely that backing the Dominican government will change this outlook. As such, any potential gains shall be negligible in the near future.

HIS_puertoplata.5.desc: "TOP SECRET - [GetDateText]\nFROM: EXECUTIVE SECRETARIAT\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\nSUBJECT: PLANNED INTERVENTION IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC\n\nThe Caribbean Legion is wrapping up its training plans, which have had moderate success. The landing in Puerto Plata is scheduled to begin in two months, after deliberation between the Department of Defense, and the joint intelligence agencies of Mexico and Cuba. In coordination with this, a generalized uprising is planned to occur in cities across the country. It is assumed that Trujillo's regime and his foreign backers are aware of the plans for the invasion and uprising.\n\nReports provided by local officers have noted that the Legion have improved in their abilities, but that previous experience limited the benefits. Some weapons and communication supplies have been granted to local insurgent cells and regiments that will join the uprising, with the expectation that they shall distract Trujillo's military outside of key regions for landings. Recent crackdowns from Trujillo's regime have targeted key cells, and tactics seem more in line with Iberian anti-terrorist methods. Furthermore, Dominican stockpiles are reportedly acquiring modern air defense systems, suggesting that investments are being made to dissuade invasion.\n\nIt is important to recognise the risk this poses to the planned intervention. These likely won't preclude defeat, but involvement from foreign governments risks turning the conflict into a protracted struggle, which would jeopardize the success of the operation. Many of those risks, however, have been known for a long period. Agents have attempted to discover and capture foreign agents, but their focus remains on ensuring the landings succeed. It would be advisable to provide the Carribean Legion with firm support from the US Air Force and Navy, to minimise risk."

Training programmes within have seen a reduction in intensity, and increasing shipments of military equipment have been noticed in and around the camp in recent weeks. Beyond this, statements from several high-ranking figures within Cuba have seen an increase in focus on the Dominican Republic, with clear hostile remarks. Action by insurgent cells within coastal regions of the Dominican Republic have also increased in intensity, even as counter-insurgency action increases.\n\nWe predict that, at the current rate, an attack against the Dominican Republic will occur in no more than two months, and likely sooner. In order to counteract this, it is highly recommended that we make our own preparations. Several contingency plans have already been drafted for your consideration. Planning shall continue, alongside the introduction of a heightened presence of special forces from our own military, and of equipment from our stockpiles.

Combat training has reduced in intensity, stockpiles of weapons have more than doubled in the preceding month, and several landing vessels are resting in ports close to the camps where the contingent of the Caribbean Legion resides. Combat and anti-insurgent activity within the Dominican Republic has increased, although the extent of success is difficult to accurately assess. It is likely that Trujillo's government at large recognises the risk posed by the Caribbean Legion, although it is improbable that they are aware of the full extent.\n\nPreliminary estimates predict that the invasion by the Legion shall begin in roughly two months. Some efforts have been made to establish cells within the island of Hispaniola, although progress in that direction is limited. Those that have succeeded will be directed to undermine the efforts of the Legion. In the meantime, aid has been sent to the Dominican Republic, and has been broadly accepted, even if the leadership remains unmoved on their diplomatic outlook towards us at this stage.

HIS_puertoplata.10.desc: "The pilot grinned. He'd been waiting a rather long time for any action. Tilting the flight stick forward, he pulled back the throttle as his A-6 Intruder pitched forward and accelerated. He squeezed the trigger, lightly at first, before growing more firm. The pull let loose an arc of fire and death, directed at the huge hill in front of him, atop which a statue of Christ the Redeemer stood. The hill he knew was dotted with fascist artillery.\n\nThe most important part of any artillery team is the spotter, his job is to find targets and instruct the man behind the guns. Today, the spotter certainly spotted something, but not a target. An American plane was racing towards his position, and it was bringing death. He could see the fire spreading from its guns, and he could only grimace. The spotter raised the radio to his lips and spoke- a warning? A cry for help? Nobody could tell- it was drowned out by the sounds of explosions and fire. Plane after plane flew over what had once been an artillery position, signaling that the invasion had begun. This story was unfolding around the Dominican Republic, American planes were pounding military targets. Below the planes, in the sea, landing craft crashed onto the shore- and over two thousand men stormed off of them- fighting for liberty, fighting against fascism.\n\nThe attack on the outside was joined by an attack on the inside: Rebels, insurgents, mobs, they all joined their comrades on the outside in their fight to overthrow the dictator. Guns of all kinds were used, from modern ones supplied by the CIA, to ancient firearms that predate the First World War. Makeshift spears, clubs- anything that could help put an end to the regime.\n\nThe effort paid off. Before Trujillo had a clear picture of the situation, the landing at Puerto Plata had succeeded- and shortly after that, the auxiliary landing at Luperón, 30 clicks west, had the same results. In the White House's Situation Room, President Richard Nixon nodded at the mustached man sitting across from him. Fidel Castro nodded back- Commander Bayo had just sent a wire."

I would have half believed you, Fidel." Fernando Gutiérrez joked while he stretched out in his chair. He dressed more like an exaggerated American tourist than as the second in command of Mexico's feared DFS. He even had with him a small glass of rum in one hand and a fan on the other.\n\n"Ah, but I am a man you put behind bars and then let go. So had I told you the full context, you wouldn't have doubted me," replied Fidel Castro, similarly dressed, remarkedly different from his usual olive drab fatigues, though smoking his usual cigar. He looked off into the warm sunrise which painted the sky a gentle pink. It was in that same direction that his dream as a student now lay again - the overthrow of the fascist Trujillo. "Besides, we aren't talking about an invasion because technically Cuba isn't invading anywhere at all. Cuban soldiers aren't landing in the Dominican Republic. It just so happens that some men employed in the Cuban army will go on their own free will."\n\n"Well still, Cuban soldiers on foreign soil sounds like a handful. Aren't you worried you'll get half the Caribbean in a panic? Some people might be worried you're going to topple all the" - Gutiérrez cleared his throat for dramatic effect - "oh so 'respectable' leaders in the region."\n\n"Please, every newspaper will be focused on the Americans. Nobody will even bother with us when they can spit on them," Fidel answered before taking a puff from his cigar.\n\n"Let's just hope the gringos don't try and throw you under the bus if things go badly. I'm sorry we couldn't be the ones helping you out, but right now our men are needed at home." Gutiérrez looked dismayed at it all.\n\n"You've done enough for me already, Fernando.

HIS_PP_flavor.2.desc: "If a Dominican had heard the sound of crunching boots on the road to the Palace, he'd immediately remember the military parades of Generalísimo Trujillo towards the National Palace from just a short few months ago. But this parade was that of triumph - the ones who had come to topple the fascists had achieved their aims. Arms linked together, Comandante Bayo and Comandante Ornés marched in a line with their comrades-in-arms; Uribarri, Morgan, Menoyo, Cubela, and Caamaño, their weapons slung on their backs. Behind them marched a mixed honor guard of legionnaires and rebels. Bayo looked ahead at the elegant domed building that was the National Palace. It wasn't as ornate as the former Presidential Palace in La Habana, but it kept the same beauty. Yet it hadn't been unscathed from the fighting that took place earlier, as Santo Domingo became a quick and brutal battleground. Windows were broken, bullet marks riddled the walls and pillars, and smoke rose out of the dome from where fire had been put out.\n\nThe fighting was over, and the scenes that had followed Fidel's triumph now replicated themselves in Dominican streets. Collaborators were being singled out and pushed into cars by rebel forces, while loyalist forces surrendered to legionnaires and were led away, hands up and heads bowed. Memorabilia from the collaborators burned in the streets, statues smashed to pieces, houses looted clean. Rebels and captured loyalists helped grieving civilians collect the dead off the streets.\n\nThe parade halted, and the rebel leadership made their way into the palace. Unlike Fidel's revolution, the meeting was tense, not comradely. They all had different visions for the future, and their alliance was starting to crack. But they needed to keep public appearances.\n\nSo they stood on the palace's steps, arms linked again, until Ornés strode to the podium, surrounded by the banners of the Legion. Below him waited journalists from all over the Caribbean, mainly American and Mexican, several camera crews, and a cheering crowd waving Cuban and Dominican flags. Ornés was no Fidel, but his authoritative voice was an instant attention-getter.\n\n"Revolutionaries! Today, the last remnants of the fascist tyranny of Trujillo is over, and now our reorganization process can begin. I will serve as head of a provisional junta of all anti-fascist forces until elections may occur...""

And who could have been better to mediate such talks than a friendly (enough) state in Europe with ties to both the Americans and Dominicans? And wouldn't you know it? Iberia fitted the description perfectly. So now the ambassador and Iberian industrialists drooled at all the favors the US would soon own them all, and so too would Trujillo.\n\nWith Trujillo's reign secured from all enemies both internal and external, Iberia could now rest easy in the region.

People who refused were massacred, and if they fought back, violent reprisals always followed as a collective punishment. He'd lost family and friends to the occupation, some who had died, others who'd disappeared.\n\nHe'd thought that maybe the Dominicans would let him be and he could eke out a life here - but things were changing, and there was an ominous feeling in the air. It wasn't just settlers coming anymore, it wasn't just Dominicans being abusive for the sake of it - there was a point to all of it. He'd noticed the trucks coming through filled with supplies, with columns of soldiers in support.\n\nThere was something bigger going on. There was a growing tension that everyone could feel.

Given the tumultuous state of global relations as of late, a path to normalized relations with Washington would be useful to have open, even if we ultimately choose not to embark on it.

Transfixed on his stopwatch, Haldeman replied, "For the conference call, Mr. President," and idly handed Nixon the relevant memo from his desktop stack.

The voice of President Castro rippled back through the speakers, "President Nixon, everybody, a well-deserved congratulations!" Also on the line were the President of Mexico and representatives of the new Dominican government in Miami and Santo Domingo, who intoned similar well-wishes. Then, everybody talked at once, and the sound became unpleasantly distorted. Cringing, Nixon continued, "Our boys in the United Front won a tough fight, and we in Washington are drinking to your fortune."

Sirens blared incessantly as fires broke out in police stations and military barracks bombed by the Dominican Air Force some 15 minutes ago.\n\nHe cursed as he heard a knock on the door, then left his suitcase to open the door.

"If these communists wish to threaten Hispanic unity, they will find our resolve is unshakable."\n\nHe took down a few notes, continuing.

At the same time, he knew how these 'temporary' occupations sometimes went.\n\nWithin hours, the Marines had set up checkpoints and secured key infrastructure throughout the city to their satisfaction.

The United States holds the ability to shape the direction of the country, and options must be carefully considered. Two primary courses of action have been identified:\n\n1) The United States extends the existing mandate of the current military government until such a time as elections are ready. This would delay elections until both the government and US advisors assess the country is ready. This would almost certainly guarantee a Dominican Republic aligned to the United States, but might be unpopular with the Dominican public and Caribbean region.\n\n2) The United States moves to hold elections as soon as possible, which the military government is unlikely and unwilling to contest. This would dissolve the current government, and establish an interim civilian one until elections are held.\n\nIt is almost certain that if elections are held in the current climate, Dr. Juan Bosch would emerge victorious. A Bosch administration would almost certainly not be unconditionally supportive of US interests, as he is critical of many US policies. However, his victory would demonstrate the United States' commitment to democracy, and almost certainly improve our regional image, especially in Cuba and Mexico."

Ambushed by several gunmen whilst being driven to his private residence, the dictator was shot several times, being declared dead shortly after. The Dominican President, Joaquín Balaguer, has dissolved the office of Caudillo and is believed to have headed the conspiracy, now initiating a purge of political rivals and high-profile collaborators of Trujillo.\n\nSoon after, even more surprising news came: Balaguer managed to negotiate a truce with anti-government rebels and the Caribbean Legion, granting a handful of concessions. Many in the country feel relief, yet concern over whether all terms of the truce shall be followed, or if the agreement will hold at all."

Officially, the objective is to retaliate against and neutralize the Haitian communist guerrilla spillover into the Dominican Republic.\n\nHowever, most geopolitical analysts believe that this reason is simply a façade to mask a strategic move by the Trujillo regime to annex Haiti and secure this exposed flank while the possibility is open given Haiti's suspended status within the Organization of Free Nations.

The new government's plans of supporting other left-wing groups in the region have similarly left the OFN on edge.\n\nThe United States in particular has expressed anger and dissapointment at this development, already having embargoed the island nation and said to be working to the detriment of the new revolutionary government. While the OFN as a whole has said little on the topic, it is clear that this is a certain loss for the free world."

hispaniola_news.56.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Death of François Duvalier"
hispaniola_news.56.desc: "The Haitian government has confirmed reports that François Duvalier, known to the Haitian public as "Papa Doc," has died.\n\nWhile details of the death have not been released, it was previously reported that President Duvalier had been diagnosed with diabetes, and had suffered a heart attack in the past. Speculation among experts is that Duvalier suffered a second heart attack, as his declining health was known.\n\nDue to successfully passing a constitutional amendment, his son, Jean-Claude, known as "Baby Doc" has assumed the role as President, and a formal ceremony is scheduled to take place. It remains to be seen how, if at all, the new President Duvalier will differ from his father in his rule."

hispaniola_news.57.desc: "Haitian President Duvalier has announced the passing of a constitutional referendum which codified him as Haitian president for life, enabled him to handpick a successor, and granted absolute power to the presidency.\n\nThis announcement was met with widespread accusations of fraud, as observers allege that ballots were pre-filled, workers claim that individuals were permitted to cast multiple votes, and voters complained of intimidation. President Duvalier claimed that 99% of the population voted in favor of the referendum, a claim rejected by many experts.\n\nMany are unsure what President Duvalier will do with his position secure - but it is clear that a new regime has been born in Haiti."

hispaniola_news.58.desc: "Haitian President Leon Cantave has announced the success of an introduced constitutional referendum, which codified himself as President for life, formalized his ability to name a successor, and gave absolute power to the presidency.\n\nPresident Cantave stated that the referendum results affirmed his mandate, though international observers have noted widespread allegations of voter suppression and violence from state security forces, which the administration denies.\n\nThe United States and neighboring countries have not yet released statements, and it remains unclear how this will affect future relations. Nonetheless, all are in agreement for the foreseeable future, Cantave's position is secure."

hispaniola_news.59.desc: "Following the failure of a constitutional referendum by Haitian President Leon Cantave, which would have codified him as president for life, and given the presidency absolute power, chaos briefly gripped the country.\n\nDespite attempts at voter suppression and intimidation, the Haitian public rallied to defeat the referendum vote, and remained protesting against Cantave's government even after its failure, demanding his removal.\n\nIn only a few days, the government conceded to the demands, and the Haitian Legislature announced Cantave's removal from office, with Paul Magloire appointed in his place. He has promised to guide the country through this difficult time, and bring much-needed stability."

hispaniola_news.61.desc: "The Haitian-Revolutionary Front War has finally come to an end, with Haiti now fully occupying the former Socialist Republic. After the elimination of the Socialist PPLN insurgency, Haiti's anti-Socialist crusade has finally come to an end with the capitulation of the Dominican People's Republic.\n\nA new occupation government for the Dominican People's Republic has been formed with the help of the OFN, known officially as a "Transitional Government", though the local populace has reportedly been either negative towards the government, or even hostile to the new OFN-OAS peacekeeping forces.\n\nThe United States is reportedly thrilled with this development, though some dissenting voices within congress and even other OFN nations are reportedly upset with yet another investment into a "Transitional Government"."

hispaniola_news.62.desc: "It seems that the island-wide Socialist revolution of Hispaniola that began with the Dominican Republic has today finally ended with the fall of Haiti to revolutionary forces. The Hispaniolan Revolutionary Front has successfully stormed Port-Au-Prince, overthrowing the OFN-backed Mulattocracy and establishing the island's second revolutionary state. With Dominican Red Army tanks pictured on the streets of the capital, Haitian revolutionary leader Jacques-Stephen Alexis has stated, "As the Americans so like to say, we are but the first domino...".\n\nThese developments are sure to have a deep impact in Latin America, not only due to the establishment of a new communist state in the region, but also as the United States has been successfully challenged and defeated by military force within its own backyard."

HIS_puertoplata_shootdown.1.desc: "Captain Michael 'Lucky' Orlowski was, by American standards, an experienced combat pilot.\n\nIn Malaya, he'd honed his bombing accuracy to perfection, learning to pull his plane out of danger before it could be hit by incoming ground fire or enemy aircraft. He'd earned the nickname 'Lucky' for his feats among his peers. The Dominicans were a walk in the park compared to the Japanese. The only threat they posed were their now-destroyed air force, and old guns that shot up some tracers and never hit anything.\n\nToday, Lucky Orlowski's winning streak finally ended.\n\nHe was confused when his early alarm warning blared loudly as he approached the target. He made his fatal mistake when he passed it off as a glitch. In the instant between the German-made missile slamming into his aircraft and him parachuting away, he realized that the Dominicans now rivaled the Japanese. And his wingman had barely any time to report the incident on the radio before he himself had missiles on his tail."

HIS_puertoplata_shootdown.2.desc: "Private Peña was 19 years old and scared of the approaching Yanqui planes.\n\nHe wasn't the only one. The entire rank and file were terrified. Every man had a story of witnessing an entire formation wiped out with a single napalm bomb. And if the heat and shockwave wasn't scary enough, you'd see the wounds and screams whenever you closed your eyes to sleep.\n\nBut they weren't completely helpless. They'd gotten skilled at evading and hiding themselves from the planes, and today they were going to get their revenge. Hauling out crates of state-of-the-art German MANPADS, they'd been personally ordered by Trujillo himself to use them for their intended purpose. The memory of El Jefe's confident smile gave Peña courage. Today, the decadent Yanquis would bleed.\n\nThey aimed and fired once the jets got in range. Several buzzing tones broke the silence of their camouflaged canopy, and eventually they all released their missiles. They stared in silence as the missiles darted away. And then Peña's missile turned a Yanqui plane into a flaming fireball. \n\nThe platoon exploded with joy. Peña was picked up by Gonzalez and Nemesio and paraded around, shaking hands with all the guys. They'd done it - they'd downed a plane. Now they could run the Yanquis back to Haiti, where they could cower behind those savage blacks!\n\nTheir celebration was interrupted by shouts of alert and curses; the Yanqui pilot had survived and was parachuting down. Peña was lowered down as he and the platoon unslung their rifles and went to nab the enemy pilot."
