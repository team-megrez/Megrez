HIS_Hispaniola_War: "The Hispaniolan Conflict"
HIS_Hispaniola_War_desc: "Hispaniola has been torn by war ever since both nations that inhabit it have had their independence. After the American occupation ended, however, things appeared to calm down, with the elections of Lescot Sr., a friend of Trujillo, possibly signaling a new age of peace between the two states.\n\nThings would not remain like this for long. With the two dictators butting heads soon after and as American interference in Haiti once more increased, tensions between the two nations began growing again over time. With clashes on the borders between the two being frequent, the larger and better trained Dominican army broke the agreed 1936 borders and occupied Haitian land.\n\nWith the Haitian army barely being able to control its own territory as guerrillas dominate the countryside, the invasion and occupation came to be a national embarrassment that has only deepened the pit that the Haitian government found itself in. With revanchism being in the mind of many, it is almost inevitable that war on the island is bound to break out again, sooner or later."

HAI_Mulatocratie: "La Mulâtrocratie"
HAI_Mulatocratie_desc: "As American troops landed in the Republic of Haiti and its occupation of the nation began, collaborators who would work with the US in the new regime. These would be the mulatto elite of the Republic, being propelled to powerful political and economic positions, giving them much control over the state. This system came to be known as the "mulattocracy" by many in the country and was deeply associated with the United States and its influence over the country.\n\nWhile this positive discrimination would only worsen after the Lescot Sr. government refused to bulge on the status quo and implement reforms, many would begin putting their hopes in Pierre Déjoie and his reformist platform, promising to bring the much-needed changes to the state. While economically the nation has seen a revival, politically it got nothing more than token reforms to a crumbling status-quo, leading many to lose hope in the government and instead turn to opposition groups."

HAI_Occupation: "The Never-Ending Occupation"
HAI_Occupation_desc: "While the occupation of Haiti by the United States nominally ended in 1934, with the last of the American troops leaving the nation by that same year, the influence of the occupier however wouldn't disappear just like that, as the US has kept control over the policies of the nation thus far.\n\nWhile some hoped that this would eventually come to fade away as time went on, the defeat of the Allies in the Second World War would change American plans for the region. Supporting the Lescot Sr. government in its clamping down on student and popular protests, the US once again took an active role in the country's politics, making sure that the region continued under its sphere of influence. However, their backing of pro-American oligarchs has inevitably resulted in many joining opposition groups who now engage in guerrilla warfare against the government with the goal of kicking the Americans out.\n\nWith these guerrillas only growing in strength after the success of the Cuban Revolution, the Haitian government has only become a larger and larger resource drain for the OFN, who now rely on "safekeeping troops" to guarantee some semblance of control. On both sides of the aisle, everyone questions how much longer the never-ending occupation can truly last."

HAI_Noirisme_Socialism: "The Ghost of Roumain"
HAI_Noirisme_Socialism_desc: "After decades of economic and social inequality, with the mulatto aristocracy dominating every facet of the state, the ideals of Socialism and Noirism have become ingrained into the consciousness of the Black population of Haiti. However, while Noirism has always dominated the ideology of the opposition, the guerrilla-favoring Socialists, emboldened by the Cuban Revolution, have seen a rapid rise in popularity and support, leading to clashes between groups that supported either one of these.\n\nThese two, however, are coming to find themselves united under a single banner, with the issues of class and racial identity no longer being opposite but instead intertwined with one another. Bringing back the Pan-Africanism of Jacques Roumain that had all but died with him in 1944, Jacques Stephen Alexis and his Parti d'Entente Populaire now dominates the opposition against the government, denouncing both the Americans and Trujillo, becoming widely popular in the process."

HAI_the_red_scare: "The Red Scare"
HAI_the_red_scare_desc: "With Trujillo removed from his Dominican Throne many internationally thought that this would spell a new age of peace and perhaps even cooperation within Hispaniola, they however would be sorely mistaken. While Trujillo was undoubtably an enabler of the racism and hatred between the Haitians and Dominicans, he was by no stretch the sole figure behind it, with both people still having little respect for each other.\n\nThis would be seen best with the ease to which many Haitians quickly turned their backs on PEP and Marxism as soon as it became associated with the new Dominican regime as Revolutionary militias began taking over the country-side, attacking Haitians and Dominicans alike, quickly rising to become the "new threat" to the Haitian Republic and its people.\n\nWhile Lavaud has done his best to keep these thoughts at bay, the Army in particular has become the host for much of the fearmonguering, with a group of anti-Revolutionary officers forming under Léon Cantave, getting ready to pounce on Lavaud if he is to ever show weakness to the Dominicans."

HAI_socialism_vs_noirism: "Socialism VS Noirism"
HAI_socialism_vs_noirism_desc: "While the PEP had grown to be the largest resistance movement against the bourgeoisie Haitian state, it wouldn't have been able to overthrow the government without the help from the remnants of the Caribbean Legion that crossed the border and aided the Revolution.\n\nTheir aid however would prove to be a blessing in disguise. While indispensable to the training of the Revolutionary army and its seizure of power, the Legion's political influence was undeniable, with Socialism gaining a much greater presence. This however wouldn't be something welcomed by all as while the Revolutionary tenants of Marxism had always been in the background of the PEP and its Pan-Africanism, many wished for it to remain there, in the background. Many still defend that the "original vision" of the Revolution was and should be centred around Noirism, that it came not from the economic struggle of the majority of the population but instead from their cultural oppression at the hands of the mulatto elites.\n\nWhile Jacques Alexis has been able to keep both groups at bay thanks to his popularity and charisma, many have begun wondering how long will he be able to walk this tight rope of supporting both sides without angering the other."

HAI_dreams_of_equality_and_democracy: "Dreams of Equality and Democracy"
HAI_dreams_of_equality_and_democracy_desc: "Hoping to be able to call for elections next year, Lavaud has been able to do what Déjoie could only dream of, uniting the many parties under his figure with the goal of approving a new constitution that would enshrine true Equality and Democracy into the heart of the Haitian Republic.\n\nBut not all would be sunshine and roses for the President, as new challenges to this dream began emerging from all over. With the elites that had supported the President in the past shunning him now, never having imagined that his reforms would go this far and run this deep, a movement headed by Lescott Jr. with the goal of returning power to the mulatto elites has been gaining steam, with the state institutions siding behind the former Prime Minister.\n\nLikewise, Washington had begun to pull back their former "full support" of Lavaud as anti-America sentiment proved to be much greater than what was thought with Max Hudicourt appearing to be the most popular politician participating in the elections, with Daniel Fignolé close behind on a more "neutral" platform."

HAI_enemies_on_all_sides: "Enemies On All Sides"
HAI_enemies_on_all_sides_desc: "While the enemies of Haiti from within Hispaniola have been destroyed, as the bourgeoisie elites that controlled the state for decades have all but fled or been imprisoned and the Fascist regime of Trujillo decapitated, there is no lack of enemies to the nation and its people.\n\nWith the Americans and their puppets all around us, the Socialist Republic of Haiti is surrounded by nothing but threats. Thus, using the resources from the conquered Dominican territory the government enacted a plan to begin building fortifications all around the coast of Hispaniola using forced labour from prisoners, preparing to defend the country in case of an invasion. At the same time a new institution to keep dissidents in line was created, the Agence de Défense Populaire.\n\nWhile initially the organisation would be kept operating mostly in the Dominican region with the goal of crushing its resistance, things would change quickly. With many in the government fearing that the army wouldn't be completely loyal to them thanks to the lingering influence of the Caribbean Legion, the ADP would be adopted as the enforcer of the states will and increasingly militarized, with its operations expanded to the whole of the island."

HAI_hispaniola_war_torn_socialist_desc: "Hispaniola had been torn by war ever since time itself could remember.

With the two dictators butting heads not too long after and American interference in Haiti once more increasing, tensions between the two nations would only grow over time. With clashes on the borders between the two being frequent, the larger and better-trained Dominican army would break the 1936 borders and occupy what was agreed to be Haitian land.\n\nWith the Socialist Revolution in Haiti, tensions have only gotten worse, with the remnants of the Caribbean Legion that fled across the border fanning the flames of war, Socialist Militias have begun crossing the border and harassing not just Dominican garrisons but also villages and towns. War in Hispaniola is now, more than ever, inevitable."

But before that can happen the issue of the border still remains, with the Dominican still occupying Haitian territory, making the bright dreams of a peaceful island tainted by doubt."

HAI_the_death_of_hope_desc: "In the aftermath of the victory of Lescot Jr. in the elections, many have lost all hope that Haiti would ever become democratic in the near future. The new President, backed by foreign influence, is engaging in ever more undemocratic methods and centralising power upon himself.\n\nThe conclusion amidst Haitian supporters of democracy is now unanimous: hope is dead until and unless Lescot Jr. falls and foreign influence is removed from the Haitian nation one way or the other."

However, others are not quite so pleased with the Hudicourt program."

# Leader descs

POLITICS_RAFAEL_TRUJILLO_DESC: "With the Caudillismo of the 20s bringing the country to its knees, Rafael Trujillo would usher in a new age with his coup in 1930, the Era de Trujillo. Bringing political stability and economic prosperity, casting off the influence of the Americans from the Republic and bringing it closer with Iberia and Italy, true allies of the state and its people, the new regime would become widely popular with the people, with Trujillo being seen by many as El Benefactor.\n\nHowever, all this stability and prosperity would be built on top of the bodies of the ones who opposed the tyrannical and brutal regime of Trujillo. Be from within, those who opposed the dictator and found themselves sent to prisions to be tortured to death, or from without, the Haitians that were unlicky enough to to be born in the regions claimed by Trujillo, either killed or forced to flee their homes in the fear of it.\n\nFor decades the Secret Police and Army were able to keep these enemies of the Republic at bay, however, with the fall of Batista in Cuba the safety of the regime would be called into question as the rebellion against him had come with US support. With fears that he will be next, Trujillo has continuously built up his military and security apparatus with Iberian and Italian help, turning the Dominican Republic into a fortress for Fascism, all the while backing anti-American movements wherever possible. With everyone knowing that action against him is a guarantee, the only question remaining is if the regime will be able to survive."



# Ideas
DOM_Dios_Trujillo: "Dios y Trujillo"
DOM_Dios_Trujillo_desc: "The Popularity of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina cannot be understated. To those old enough to remember the poverty and chaos of the 1920s, he is the savior of the nation. To those who are younger, he is the protector of the Dominicans from American imperialism. While there are plenty who see him as nothing more than a brute, the motto of 'Dios y Trujillo' is plastered across the nation, often below his portrait. To many Dominicans, God and Trujillo are one and the same."

DOM_Blanqueamiento: "Blanqueamiento"
DOM_Blanqueamiento_desc: "Under Trujillo, the Dominican Republic has undertaken a particularly notable initiative, the Blanqueamiento, or 'Whitening'. Believing that Spanish White culture stands as the beacon that civilized the primitives of the region, the Dominican Republic took in Republican refugees fleeing from the Spanish Civil War despite his own ideological and political proximity to the Nationalists, and also, surprisingly, Jewish refugees fleeing the advances of the Nazis during the Second World War.\n\nThis, however, would only be the first step. After the end of the conflict, Trujillo has pursued closer ties with Franco and pushed for trade, cultural and, most importantly, emigration accords with the peninsula. While these initiatives have proven themselves successful, with Iberians moving to the island in droves, they would still not make much of a dent in the largely mulatto and black population.\n\nAs a response to growing tensions with immigrant whites, his regime began pushing for xenophobic propaganda targeting Haitians, promoting discrimination against the overwhelming number of Haitian blacks living in the country. These have resulted in a number of pogroms and the expulsion of Haitians from border communities, artificially increasing the percentage occupied by the whites in the process."

DOM_Rising_Resistance: "Rising Resistance"
DOM_Rising_Resistance_desc: "To outsiders, it appears as if all of the Dominican Republic loves Trujillo, but there are those who would risk it all to see him deposed.

HIS_puertoplata.1.desc: "CONFIDENTIAL\n\nTO: DOCTOR ANTÓNIO OLIVEIRA SALAZAR, GENERALÍSIMO FRANCISCO FRANCO\n\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC - STRATEGIC ALLY IN THE CARIBBEAN\n\nWith the collapse of the Triumvirate, the main lifeline of the Dominican Republic was severed. Out of concern for the continued security of the state, and viewing Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo's position as vulnerable, a small group of generals within the Armed Forces plotted a coup d'état. The plot was quickly discovered by government intelligence agencies within the last week and was broken up, with little difficulty and no known foreign support.\n\nThis is the first of this kind of plot in over a decade, frequently occurring in the past when Trujillo had not yet consolidated. However, recent events have increased the threat posed by these plots. Several nations within the region are hostile to the regime: Mexico and Venezuela have antagonized it for a long time, and recent events in Cuba have turned them into a centre of anti-Trujillo organization, not to mention the active opposition that the United States has presented since the end of the War. Trujillo has privately expressed concern over future plots receiving backing from said nations, and the chance that they may eventually succeed.\n\nIt is imperative that Trujillo remains in power. The Dominican Republic is currently our closest ally within Latin America, and the efforts of Rafael Trujillo play a key part in our strategic interests. With the collapse of the Triumvirate, many view his government's position as isolated barring for our presence. If his regime were to collapse due to outside pressure, the likely replacements will be far less open to collaboration. Extra attention shall be focused on the nation, and it would be recommended that additional support should be given to the state openly, to improve perceptions of its diplomatic standing.\n\nFrom the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."

HIS_puertoplata.2.desc: "TOP SECRET - [GetDateText]\nFROM: EXECUTIVE SECRETARIAT\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\nSUBJECT: INSTABILITY WITHIN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC\n\nRecent upheavals geopolitically have left the regime of Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo weak. An abortive coup plot attained some momentum shortly after the collapse of the Triumvirate, but was ultimately crushed. Whilst this coup failed, it indicates a shift in trend for Dominican politics. Other coup plots, particularly those that are more organised, seem likely. Furthermore, the nation's diplomatic standing remains isolated barring the presence of Iberia. Efforts to improve relations with nearby nations are unlikely, considering the regime has turned into a pariah state throughout the past decade.\n\nSeveral agents in the field have used their connections with loyal officials in portions of the Dominican Republic to uncover the failed coup. The response was a minor purge, which has concerned some officials. In Cuba, plans to aid the Caribbean Legion in replacing Trujillo are underway (Read attached for more info). Continued military presence from Dominican forces on the Haitian border suggest that foreign policy remains unchanged.\n\nIt is imperative that we ensure that the regime governed by Trujillo is replaced. Most local opposition is broadly unified against Trujillo's sympathetic behaviour to Fascist and anti-American regimes in Europe and Latin America. Such opposition is also sympathetic to us, or to Cuba and Mexico. In combatting Trujillo, agents have been sent over to provide aid to insurgents and organize them for the Legion's planned offensive. Agents are also currently organising opposition within the Dominican military, with some success."

These agents were given the task of counterespionage, in order to discover any potential plots to overthrow Rafael Trujillo's government. Recent findings suggest that the risk of a foreign-backed plot to remove Trujillo are correct.\n\nThrough a mixture of intimidation, interception, and bribery, our agents have managed to partially infiltrate a group of 2,000 soldiers belonging to the Caribbean Legion, receiving training in amphibious landing and drilled in combat, and is composed mostly of political dissidents who left the nation in recent years, along with volunteers from Cuba and abroad. There is little reason to doubt that they are preparing for an attack against the Dominican Republic, especially with patterns of recent attacks from insurgent cells targeting several coastal regions.\n\nThis is a major deterioration in prospects for the Dominican Republic, and a government similar to that of Cuba would doubtlessly be hostile to us, not to mention it would jeopardize our interests in Latin America as a whole. The Dominican government has been promptly warned of the threat, and is preparing for a major, sudden war. Beyond this, the intensity of our efforts to uncover the Legion's plans will likely prevent future advances without putting our agents at heightened, unneeded risks. Several contingency plans have been prepared for an event of this manner, and should be executed immediately."

It seems likely that they have discovered the plans of the Americans and Cubans as well, with a heightened presence of known security agents. Santo Domingo is neutral in regards to policy directed at us, and Iberia is hostile. It seems unlikely that backing the Dominican government will change this outlook.

HIS_puertoplata.5.desc: "TOP SECRET - [GetDateText]\nFROM: EXECUTIVE SECRETARIAT\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\nSUBJECT: PLANNED INTERVENTION IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC\n\nThe Caribbean Legion is wrapping up its training plans, which have had moderate success. The landing in Puerto Plata is scheduled to begin in two months, after deliberation between the Department of Defense, and the joint intelligence agencies of Mexico and Cuba. In coordination with this, a generalized uprising is planned to occur in cities across the country. It is assumed that Trujillo's regime and his foreign backers are aware of the plans for the invasion and uprising.\n\nReports provided by local officers have noted that the Legion have improved in their abilities, but that previous experience limited the benefits. Some weapons and communication supplies have been granted to local insurgent cells and regiments that will join the uprising, with the expectation that they shall distract Trujillo's military outside of key regions for landings. Recent crackdowns from Trujillo's regime have targeted key cells, and tactics seem more in line with Iberian anti-terrorist methods. Furthermore, Dominican stockpiles are reportedly acquiring modern air defense systems, suggesting that investments are being made to dissuade invasion.\n\nIt is important to recognise the risk this poses to the planned intervention. These likely won't preclude defeat, but involvement from foreign governments risks turning the conflict into a protracted struggle, which would jeopardize the success of the operation. Many of those risks, however, have been known for a long period. Agents have attempted to discover and capture foreign agents, but their focus remains on ensuring the landings succeed. It would be advisable to provide the Carribean Legion with firm support from the US Air Force and Navy, to minimise risk."

Beyond this, statements from several high-ranking figures within Cuba have seen an increase in focus on the Dominican Republic, with clear hostile remarks.

In order to counteract this, it is highly recommended that we make our own preparations. Several contingency plans have already been drafted for your consideration.

Tilting the flight stick forward, he pulled back the throttle as his A-6 Intruder pitched forward and accelerated. He squeezed the trigger, lightly at first, before growing more firm. The pull let loose an arc of fire and death, directed at the huge hill in front of him, atop which a statue of Christ the Redeemer stood. The hill he knew was dotted with fascist artillery.\n\nThe most important part of any artillery team is the spotter, his job is to find targets and instruct the man behind the guns. Today, the spotter certainly spotted something, but not a target. An American plane was racing towards his position, and it was bringing death. He could see the fire spreading from its guns, and he could only grimace. The spotter raised the radio to his lips and spoke- a warning? A cry for help? Nobody could tell- it was drowned out by the sounds of explosions and fire. Plane after plane flew over what had once been an artillery position, signaling that the invasion had begun. This story was unfolding around the Dominican Republic, American planes were pounding military targets. Below the planes, in the sea, landing craft crashed onto the shore- and over two thousand men stormed off of them- fighting for liberty, fighting against fascism.\n\nThe attack on the outside was joined by an attack on the inside: Rebels, insurgents, mobs, they all joined their comrades on the outside in their fight to overthrow the dictator. Guns of all kinds were used, from modern ones supplied by the CIA, to ancient firearms that predate the First World War. Makeshift spears, clubs- anything that could help put an end to the regime.\n\nThe effort paid off. Before Trujillo had a clear picture of the situation, the landing at Puerto Plata had succeeded- and shortly after that, the auxiliary landing at Luperón, 30 clicks west, had the same results. In the White House's Situation Room, President Richard Nixon nodded at the mustached man sitting across from him. Fidel Castro nodded back- Commander Bayo had just sent a wire."

HIS_PP_flavor.2.desc: "If a Dominican had heard the sound of crunching boots on the road to the Palace, he'd immediately assume that Generalissimo Trujillo was coming with a military parade. But this parade was that of triumph - the ones who had come to topple the fascists had achieved their aims. Arms linked together, Comandante Bayo marched in a line with his comrades-in-arms; Uribarri, Morgan, Menoyo, Cubela, and Caamaño, their weapons slung on their backs. Behind them marched a mixed honor guard of legionnaires and rebels. Bayo looked ahead at the elegant domed building that was the National Palace. It wasn't as ornate as the former Presidential Palace in La Habana, but it kept the same beauty. Yet it hadn't been unscathed from the fighting that took place earlier, as Ciudad Trujillo became a quick and brutal battleground. Windows were broken, bullet marks riddled the walls and pillars, and smoke rose out of the dome from where fire had been put out.\n\nThe fighting was over, and the scenes that had followed Fidel's triumph now replicated themselves in Dominican streets. Collaborators were being singled out and pushed into cars by rebel forces, while loyalist forces surrendered to legionnaires and were led away, hands up and heads bowed. Trujillo's portraits burned in the streets, his statues smashed to pieces, the houses of his loyalists looted clean. Rebels helped grieving civilians collect the dead off the streets.\n\nThe parade halted, and Bayo and his subordinates made their way into the palace. Unlike Fidel's revolution, the meeting was tense, not comradely. They all had different visions for the future, and their alliance was starting to crack. But they needed to keep public appearances.\n\nSo they stood on the palace's steps, arms linked again, until Bayo strode to the podium, surrounded by the banners of the Legion. Below him waited OFN and Mexican journalists, camera crews, and a cheering crowd waving Cuban and Dominican flags. Bayo was no Fidel, but his authoritative voice was an instant attention-getter.\n\n"Revolutionaries! Today, the fascist tyranny of Trujillo is over, and now our reorganization process can begin.
