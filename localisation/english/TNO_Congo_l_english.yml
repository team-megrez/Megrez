He preferred to instead highlight how these new forces would not just be unmotivated rabble but rather highly motivated divisions eager to earn a palatable wage.

Siegfried Müller, who was rarely confused, lost all his words in that instance for the unusual insolence.\n\n\"I-...

What do you mean by imminent?\"\n\nSteiner took on a concerned expression when he saw the clerk's struggle to put it into words. Once again it took a few attempts before it came out, the messenger already bathing in sweat. \"It is the Führer. He has died!\" A sigh deeper than the Congo Lake made his relief of finally having delivered the message obvious.\n\nRolf Steiner bent back in his chair and inhaled uneasily. He exhaled thoughtfully while messaging his brows in a solemn demeanor. \"Gottverdammt!\" He waved the quivering clerk away. \"This is a disaster! We can merely surmise what might happen to the Reich.\"\n\nNow Müller took the word quite undisturbed. \"I don't understand your extremeness.\" He shrugged. \"Everyone dies.

Some of the black faces staring up at him looked frozen in fear; Steiner wasn't sure whether it was because they knew exactly who he was, or because they had never seen a helicopter before. As the craft touched down, the band struck up the first notes of Heia Safari. Steiner's first sight was the back of an SS officer struggling to keep hold of his cap and make himself heard above the deafening rotor-blade roar as he barked at his men in German, pleading with them to close ranks. Their only response was a curious stare until their native NCOs-in actuality, descendants of local tribal royalty-echoed the order in Lingala. The depth of Steiner's frown after observing this sorry sight eclipsed even the deep, flat notes of the trumpets struggling to amble their way through the tune.\n\nIn the capital, things had been going well. The parades in Léopoldville for the press and Schild observers showed the pride of Zentralafrika, men sporting the neatest uniforms, the latest equipment, the crispest salutes. Above the skies of Pointe-Noire, Schild pilots exercised in dizzying air-to-air maneuvers, dazzling the stunned international onlookers below. Collectively they had done an excellent job at fooling the Reich, fooling the South Africans, and fooling the world into thinking they were an effective, well-ordered military force. But gazing on this mass of half-clothed men standing in front of a decrepit Bf-109 converted into a crop-duster, Steiner began to wonder if they had fooled themselves, too. As the press speculated on what wunderwaffe could be hiding deep in the jungles of Zentralafrika, Steiner was one of a few who knew the sad truth. The only military secrets lingering out here were how little training or motivation these local troops had to move over to the next village, much less down to the frontline."

This right there is the incarnation of its absence. I can tell you that whoever was involved in this being possible has to be given a new assignment.\" Müller started looking at the covering sheets of the many folders and papers.

He tilted his head and made an urging gesture with his hand. \"You said so yourself: You don't expect me to read it. Clear me up.

Now add mercenaries, the clique of a certain general, and the different branches of the Zentralafrikan military to the equation...\"\n\nThe Reichskommissar's smile had vanished. \"Well, shit!

Dropping his pick and wiping his brow, he shambled toward the crowd bunched by the elevator, waiting his turn to ride up and feel the warm rays on his sweat-soaked clothes.\n\nWhat he saw on the surface only made him sweat more.\n\nMr. Peeters, the foreman, stood next to a white man wearing a uniform Alongi had never seen; certainly no guard. As the miners left the elevator, the stranger counted them off one-by-one. Every tenth man was pulled aside by two soldiers. Alongi breathed a sigh of relief when he heard \"neun\" as he stepped off the platform. But suddenly, the stranger raised his hand and the guards tore Alongi from his place in the line, pushing him toward a truck.\n\n\"You bastard, we had an agreement! Every tenth man for your quota, picked at random.\" Peeters' broken German belied his rage, but the Sturmbannführer only smirked. \"I need good soldiers for the Reich, not hospital wards. The one behind him won't last three weeks. This one is strong.\"\n\n\"This colony won't last three weeks if you take all my best men!\" The German officer stiffened. \"Well then, Mr. Peeters, perhaps you'd like to return to your family in Europe? I hear Burgundy is much more temperate this time of year than the Kongo.\" Officially, the penalty for insufficient enthusiasm among the Belgians was transportation home. In reality, Steiner was a merciful man-he simply had the dissenters shot.\n\nAs a chill ran down his spine, Peeters acquiesced. He watched Alongi and all the others carted off to the frontline, likely to never see their homes again. \"That makes two of us,\" he muttered under his breath in French as the trucks rolled by."

Gone was the music, the festivities and the joviality that usually accompanied these gatherings, but the trademark smoke cloud still loomed large over the mercenaries as they puffed away in the darkness. The smoke swirled among the beam of light emanating from the overhead projector, casting an eerie haze over each of the slides. The final image showed a grand parade of Zentralafrika's finest SS divisions down the streets of Léopoldville with Müller's palace towering over the background. Mixed with the smoke, it looked like the palace was on fire. And considering what happened next, it might as well have been.\n\nBon Denard was the first to rise. He ashed his cigarette and walked out of the room, laughing the whole way. Mike Hoare rose next, but-much to everyone's surprise-moved forward to shake Müller's hand. \"You dirty harlot, you fucking traitor! They're our own people!\" roared Duck Van Der Linde, the young South African. Hoare chuckled, \"We're defending your people, you stupid Afrikaner-and killing mine. It's what the degenerates deserve, thinking the black is equal to the white. And last time I checked, we're both Zentralafrikans now. Think about which way the wind is blowing, kid.\" While the Anglos warred in English, a similar argument played out in French. Goosens, the hot-headed Belgian, asking how his compatriots could march with SS divisions to conquer another people considering the Burgundian occupation of La Patrie. Crevecoeur and Schramme calling him a coward as they thought of their vast estates and suddenly-bright prospects of accelerating their climbs up the corporate ladder.\n\nMüller couldn't keep track of the polyglot conversations swirling about him. It was becoming increasingly clear he couldn't keep track of much of anything. When the dust settled, some of the mercenaries remained, committed to money above all else.

Who else could say that? After all, this little fuss was nothing compared to the horrors back home, in Europe or Asia! Slowly but surely, the evening picked up steam until it was just like old times-that is, of course, except for Mr. Smith.\n\nAs Müller approached, the American refused to shake his hand. \"Ah, my friend, I think you're in need of a gift!\" Müller spat in his rehearsed English. With a snap of his fingers, a native SS man walked in toward the pair carrying a domed dish. When he arrived, Müller encouraged Smith to lift it with a grin. Soon, Smith was smiling too, for the papers inside were worth more than their weight in gold. Shipping labels, bearing legitimate South African customs markings: just enough to move his entire shipment of diamonds across the sea to America out of Pointe-Noire...er, Cape Town, of course. Drunk on joy and fine wine, Smith didn't stop to consider the small flecks of blood on the labels, an ugly reminder of how Müller had come to acquire them just a few hours before."

 COG_focus.30.desc:0 "The Generalbüro's sub-division for trade affairs had been in heated discussion for much of the last couple of days. They were still trading goods, including a vast array of raw materials that were sold over Germania's required quota, with the United States. It had always been to the distaste of many in the NSDAP, but most didn't know or simply didn't care as much about Africa as maybe Hans Hüttig did. However, it was time of war now. While the goods weren't necessary for the war effort yet as a certain prime customer of them had just collapsed, there were talks that the US was in dire negotiation to help the South Afrikans.\n\nMany in the trade affairs office questioned this. Yet not much more, for they also didn't question the presence of generous American investors and companies in the Reichskommissariat. Almost nobody but the stupid green boys did by now. The office wasn't sure of its orders, nonetheless.\n\nToday, Rolf Steiner finally delivered them in person. The trades would go on in the usual manner. The Reichskommissar hoped to appease domestic investors, on the one hand, and diverge foreign aggression, on the other. Steiner wasn't particularly in favor of that command, but carried it out as was expected of him."

Though the buildings scratched at each other's veneers, you actually had to leave the buildings and enter each of them through the main entrance. He took out a cigarette from his favorite American brand and was glad that the latest shipments brought an extra huge load; not all Zentralafrikan functionaries were particularly glad about the American trade, but sooner or later even the most loyal civil servants would find pleasure in some of the American Schweinehund's goods.\n\nThe smoldering of the cigarette provided the only light for him this early as Hans wondered whether this was necessary. Rolf Steiner himself had visited his insular office in the Generalbüro to make sure the task was understood. Well, there was only one to understand it because of all the administrative entities his office was the most understaffed. It has ever been. When he arrived five years ago, they were two, now it is only him as Gerhard left during the Cameroon Conflicts. Ever since, in fact even before, the Generalbüro never bothered to have enough staff to properly manage the arms inventory.\n\nNow it is all coming back to him thanks to this goddamn war. Now Steiner is shitting his pants about any and every weapon shipment's whereabouts. Now he has to trace all these shipments back, whether from last year or the establishment of the Reichskommissariat doesn't matter. Steiner wants all these documents looked over and an updated list of all available equipment.\n\nAt least he doesn't have to do it all by himself. As he threw the stub away, tired bureaucrats from the office for trade affairs arrived. Ten of them. How were they supposed to fit into his cramped office and properly look over thousands of papers like this? The day was already starting and he was already having enough."

Not only is it one of the most important administrative complexes and one of the largest civilian employers of the Sisyphean bureaucracy but it is also the only of its Afrikan counterparts that can report vast profits. In fact, it even stands rivalling the most profitable of the European Reichskommissariats. Next to Hans Hüttig's fiefdom, it is the Zentralafrikan economy is the only one operating in the black, making more than merely respectable profits compared to Ostafrika.\n\nThe many sources the money is generated from as well as the many sources it is sunk into need to be administrated by a huge cadre of able functionaries. Most of the money is, of course, credited to the Reich's account and thus funneled into the coffers of the Reichswirtschaftsministerium in Germania.\n\nHowever, it has been often inquired how the Reichskommissariat makes its profits. In that, it operates similarly to some of the many corporations present. Swaths of the remaining money is put into deals. It is used to accommodate for the needs of potential foreign investors, conducted beyond the Reich's reach. To fulfill the deals money flows into the appeasement of the corporations' interests. In turn, they start operations in the Reichskommissariat, working into sustaining the sub-division for economic affairs as an expanding office. Apart from that the office also undertakes investments known only to the highest echelons of governance. Bribery foremost amongst them.\n\nBut now with a war running, the sub-division needs to restructure for accommodation and money has to be closely tracked as to be properly funneled towards success in the war."

He wasn't present. As always, he had taken off earlier for the weekend. Actually, he took off earlier every day, but for the weekends even earlier. Rolf Steiner entered instead and made some comments about Müller having become very impatient. After releasing the bureaucrats he made himself comfortable in the Reichskommissar's lounge to work through the documents.\n\nThe next day he intercepted Siegfried Müller before flying off to the Congo Lake for a trip. They got into his office and Steiner reviewed the figures for his superior. Just as Müller asked of him, Rolf Steiner devised a new wartime budget to accommodate for the expenses of such a huge war.\n\nHe did even more than was asked of him. His new budgetary plan included a certitude in case the foreign investors and entrepreneurs considered pulling out their investments due to the raging war, which would have brought the old dusty budget to a cataclysmic crumbling. But Steiner seemingly accommodated even for such a catastrophe.\n\nIn all of this 'discussion' the Reichskommissar just said one single word."

 COG_focus.34.desc:0 "After the Generalbüro had already filed several dozen reports in the last few weeks, it became obvious that a hugely scaled war is nothing but stress on the Reichskommissariat's coffers. Numerous of the elder bureaucrats have been heard shouting how they damned this war for not being like the Cameroon Conflicts. Well, damn them; they didn't have to bravely fight on the frontlines back then. But there's some truth in there. Those conflicts didn't suck the profits, once admired by even some of the European Reichskommissars, dry as this war.\n\nYet the war is sucking dry something else, at least it will begin soon. It will suck the manpower pool dry. As there are neither endless hordes of greedy mercenaries nor we have the money to employ them, Steiner quickly dragged Siegfried Müller out of this warrior's fantasy.\n\nFortunately, though, they had lots of men roaming and living in the Congolese jungle. Those men consisted of some sorry conglomerates of rural Afrikan settlements, of once employed mercenaries, rogue former soldiers, Afrikan and foreign adventurous and surely some fled plantation workers; most likely fled from Hüttig as well. But they had one thing in common: They admired the legendary Warrior of the Jungle, Bob Denard, and are a precious resource we need; manpower.\n\nThus, this man and his commando are the means to this treasure. Denard, however, had refused Müller's orders more often than any other man in Zentralafrika, sometimes making them look like desperate pleas. As such, we must make this proposition lucrative for him as well. We can either promise him an increased pay or award him more freedoms for his commando after the war, for he is still in our service despite his arrogance.\n\nWe must tread carefully. We need him to get to those men. This war may not be decided on the frontlines but by our careful proposition and, unfortunately, Denard's affinity of it."

Müller kneaded his forehead and acted as if he understood the plan in front of the witnessing generals of the Waffen-SS and garrison.

I might not even have comprehended the gist of it.\" He put up his hands. \"Just pinpoint the details for me right now.\"\n\nDenard was confused that someone didn't understand his plan but played along. \"I'll make it as easy as I can. Me and my commando will recruit partisans beyond the friendly frontlines as well as smuggle over some local militants. They will sow terror and discord among the enemy and will be operating individually to act as guerilla commandos of their own in case the enemy advances heavily. For their support certain disguised militants will be deployed as Afrikan civilians if they should ever get cut off.\"\n\n\"Yep, those were the things I got.\"\n\nDenard shrugged. \"There isn't more to it.\"\n\nMüller thought this could have been the day he finally understood the mystery of Denard, but he didn't. \"Well, I guess I'll have this plan enacted then.

The Reichskommissar never understood the necessity of enacting this genius plan to effectively tame and dominate the enemy upon her roar.\n\nThe South African War, however, raging ferociously across the continent shifted the odds and our wary border patrols have thinned to effectively consist only of von Blottnitz's unit. Upon this realization, Rolf Steiner arranged a meeting between Gerd von Blottnitz and the Reichskommissar to discuss an urgent enactment of the ambitious mercenary's plan."

The Reichskommissar knew it from his friend, Wolfgang Schenck, that the Südwestafrika administration did it as well. Swift, efficient, beneficial and with no one, particularly the Reich, noticing.\n\nThis group of the Generalbüro's most decorated functionaries was about to embark on one of the biggest document forging operations in recent history. For days they would have to work themselves into a frenzy by going over figures, adjusting them and properly conveying them onto the fake certificates. Everyone involved knew it was a high crime against their fatherland, the Reich, but also knew it was a bigger crime not to do so.\n\nIt was war and Zentralafrika needed money to keep up with the war effort, lots of money. The sole way to get such huge swaths is by working with the many foreign investors already, or potentially, bolstering our coffers. If the Reich was ever to find out about such treasonous acts, the whole Generalbüro would find itself trialed at home, whenever that may be... Thus, the interaction with the investors has to be covered with faked documents, for our sake and theirs.\n\nAs such this operation of papers and figures, of lies and necessity was just as risky as any of the famed operations conducted by Reinhard Gehlen."

Léonard Mulamba, representing the native Waffen-SS, was pondering above a huge map on the table, secluded from the others. Jean Schramme and some mercenary commanders were lying on the Reichskommissar's lounge, about to fall asleep in their drunken state. And the Reichskommissar? He was just reentering the room with an icy cold drink of lemon water.\n\n\"Gentlemen, we may proceed.\" He subsided in his cushioned chair and began toying at his Iron Cross with his fingers.\nMulamba took the word in bumpy German, intermingled with English. \"I just assembled the last pieces on this map.

I think that's what the general was about to say. Reichskommissar, I presume you know the proposed strategies well enough by now. This war has been raging long enough in this unusually decentralized manner. The time is ripe for you to decide on one of our strategies.\"\n\nMüller slurped the last droplet of his drink as Steiner looked at him expectantly. \"Sure, I'll do.\" He put his Iron Cross back on and went towards the curtains. \"But the war in here has been raging on for far too long as well, my friends.

War is a hungry monstrosity and isn't picky when it comes to the next meal. These particularly stale apples might have been real goodies in the early 50s, yet even back then they were the second quality choice Germania bothered to send down to Zentralafrika for the Cameroon Conflicts.\n\nThose rusty shells had either been found in desperation or in a stroke of luck when looking through the sealed off compounds near the Cameroon border abandoned after their last use in the 50s. Now they have been shipped to the Reichskommissar's maintenance crew to be put back together.

Though hindered by the cane von Thoma had to use for age-induced reasons, they entered the room in cadence.\n\nNow that the war had shaped into its horrific state due to the prior negligence of the correct strategy, they call up on him again. He shouldn't have come; that's not the way to treat an experienced member of the Afrika Korps. But von Thoma isn't an arrogant man and he is loyal to... his... Reich, besides. His strategy will surely win them the war.\n\nRolf Steiner sat observantly in a corner of the vast room, as von Thoma's lessers laid out the map and began reviewing their Panzer-focused strategy to the Reichskommissar. The general smiled at Steiner, who quickly left the room under loud rambling, and took the word for himself, briskly cutting off his adjutants. Elaborately he explained his plan for the new mobile warfare doctrine centered on Panzers, effectively adjusting Erwin Rommel's overused strategies to a continent-wide scale. Or as von Thoma called it, he 'improved' them.\n\nDespite Steiner's rambling's still ringing in his ears, Müller stayed loyal to his decision and sent von Thoma's clique to the frontline with extensive combat authority."

They rolled out a map. Mulamba was about to say something when the Oberst roughly pushed him to the side for Müller to proceed. He explained his infantry-based strategy again, elaborated on the roles of the garrison, the native SS and the mercenaries respectively and, finally, reviewed the strategically best positions he had worked out with his staff.\n\nSteiner seemed mildly pleased and thanked the Waffen-SS' representative for his efforts. Von Thoma only nodded at the Oberst and hypocritically congratulated the Reichskommissar on this plan and wished him luck before leaving the room with his adjutants.\n\nMüller, however, smiled at Steiner and told him how hard they had worked on this grand plan.

Unsurprisingly, he only found some higher chiefs of staff in the room besides Müller. Wilhelm von Thoma and his clique were provocatively absent.\n\nHowever, it sure made things easier for Steiner. He took his aides' documents and presented them to the Reichskommissar and the other military staff. He neatly laid out every detail of his strategy heavily involving the use of air cavalry, not just as mere transportation but putting it to a wide range of uses. But he was very quick about it not to waste any second.\n\nOnce Müller approved of his plan with a simple and swift nod, much to Steiner's liking, he left the room to prepare his subordinates for putting his strategy to practice at the frontlines. As a minister, he saw himself obliged not to forget his duties in Léopoldville. As such he would mainly be represented by his lessers, while he would only inspect the frontlines when he deemed it necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, Steiner could sense somebody to be seething with rage about his plan being put into action all the while. And days later rumor was spreading at the Oberkommando that Wilhelm von Thoma was preparing to write another book in response to what he perceived as a public shaming: someone in a lesser rank than von Thoma drafting a useful military strategy.

It's the pride of the local helicopter fleet, gleaming and black-edged like a phantom.

How raspberryish. How long has it been since he has tasted raspberries? But not like that, surely. Is there blood on his hands or is it just the wrath of his country on his back? Is there a difference?\n\nHe barely hears the panicked shouts: \"What are you doing, Schenck? I like the trees too but the insurgents have all gone!

Either way, Müller can tell when a man is beaten, and Schenck is sure as hell beaten. Perhaps the hunt should be called off.\n\nHe asks again if Schenck wants to continue with the trip. Below him the ruined village sprawls bloated and thick with fumes. It appears that they hit a few of the fuel tanks on approach, and some of the figures running from the scene are luminescent, haloed with gasoline flame. Schenck gazes at the scene and says nothing: his hands, however, reveal what his gaping mouth cannot.\n\nMüller shakes his head and calls for the chopper to head back to base. Maybe another time, friend. Shame you couldn't be a stronger hunter. A corner of his mind thinks that the problem lies with their medical care: perhaps the partisans have poisoned the medical supply?

A steady drip of morphine and a few hours of bed rest and he'll be up. At least, until the next time.\n\nAs he lies there in the ward, he looks back on his experience. Did Müller always know about his condition and try to trigger it deliberately? He doesn't think so, but it's always been hard to tell with Müller. In his mind people fall down endlessly, like pins hit by an errant ball, at the touch of the bullets, whistling as they travel down the length of the long and undulating gun. Perhaps that Freud fellow had the right idea about the unconscious: Schenck isn't sure where these dreams are coming from, but he wants them repressed and sent back to the dark corners of the mind.\n\nEither way, one thing is certain: Schenck is never going hunting with Müller ever again.

It's not quite as wide as a church door, nor as deep as a coffin nail; but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Why would Schenck refuse him? Didn't he have the best of fun on the 1958 hunt? (It's a shame about what happened to the natives, but Müller is not one to dwell on tragedies. At least they paid the families off.) Sure, the two have had their differences, and by Gott Schenck can be such a turn-off when he gets all pissy about the 'rights of the natives' and 'proper diplomatic protocol', but they've been firm friends, right?\n\n... Right?\n\nTragedy is best summarized as this: the intrusion of reality into the dreams of men. And as Müller sits there, a whole network of imagined alliances comes crashing around his broad-shouldered bulk. A friendship, a world: all these begin to come undone. If Schenck doesn't even like Müller enough to go hunting with him after all these years. how much can he be trusted? And what about, God forbid, Hüttig?\n\nIt's a tragedy, pure and simple: and the Hunter of the Congo is in the spotlight. He runs through the list of corporations in the Kommissariat with a new skepticism and some degree of desperation. He must ascertain all his people are truly loyal to him, and not puppets of the other Reichskommissariats aiming to poison his success, or perhaps foreign spies. And the planned diplomatic Mega-Hunts next year will be curtailed, indefinitely: Müller has no time for men who have no time for him.\n\nThis is the Hunter of the Congo in new lights: not as hunter, but as prey."

 COG_hunt.116.desc:0 "Müller, like most seasoned hunters, is just sociopathic enough to dismiss sights which would shake most lesser men to their boots. And certainly an episode, while regrettable, is nothing Müller has not seen before (poor Heinrich never quite recovered, which is a shame, because the fellow was such a good shot with a Mauser). And so the precise reason for unease is lost on the Reichskommissar as he flies back to Léopoldville, and after he returns: and yet it persists, like a particularly vile particle of food stuck behind a tooth.\n\nHe wonders, again, if the problem is with the medical supply. He orders the existing caches of medicine checked, their staff and personnel profiled and all suspicious personnel to be fired and terminated: and yet something remains amiss. In a fit of suspicion, he orders the refiling of all personnel suffering from similar illnesses and reads them himself (truly commendable for the generally ill-lettered man), tossing them to his medical staff with orders for new remedies.\n\nAnd yet the rotten little unease persists.\n\nHe writes a letter to Schenck, asking if the man is alright. He gets a frigid response and a cool affirmation that Schenck is alright, thank you for asking, and would you kindly please stop sending messages through this channel? Thankfully Müller is just dense enough to interpret it as a friendly message, and drops the matter. If Schenck is well, then so is Müller. Perhaps in time he might even recover enough to go on another partisan hunt."

There was always the smaller one for closer game, as his aides had reminded him. To hell with that! Boring beyond belief. He'd shot everything in range of that old piece of junk. Müller had told them to focus on their jobs of administering the colony, and leave the real work of hunting to him!\n\nJust as he laid his feet on the parapet and took the first refreshing sip of his ice-cold drink, he had an idea. \"Damn me for this thought,\" he got up, \"but damn me for not thinking about it earlier.\" He went to the typewriter. \"I am bloody here for this.\"\n\n\"Hans, my arrogant colleague, we are in this together. The Führer wants us to cooperate, but you are the obstacle here, not Wolfgang and I.\"\n\nDespite his thoughts, he began the letter with the same politeness he often displayed in his formal invitations. But his snide commentary continued, if only for his own enjoyment. \"You are a different caliber, Hans. But I have hunted worse. You have a damn big territory: how could you neglect its splendor? Let me incite a bit of passion in you.\" Müller knew this letter would likely amount to nothing. He had nothing better to do, though. So, why not bother with doing what he was here for? This seemed like the best way to cooperate with his joint Reichskommissars to make Afrika an integral part of the Reich. Strictly business... Hüttig would like that phrasing!\n\nThere would have been no problem getting Wolfgang Schenck, his old friend, to tag alone. Now there was a man who understood how to assert German dominance... in one way or the other. The natives needed time. \"His loss if he says no; I am just doing my job here!\" Müller roared with laughter as he wrote the letter. \"You know, Hans, we should really all be friends here and find our peace. I am doing you a favor, after all, trying to end your self-imposed isolation. All of Germania think you're useless, you old grump...\""

Begone!\" The fury of the name Müller was already walloping inside him.\n\nHe put his reading glasses on. He groped the desk tightly. With every letter he read, his knuckles got increasingly white. The arrogant tone intermingling with the contents gave him the rest. He hit the top of his desk with his fist as hard as he could. The pain was bearable due to his general rage. 'Fuck this arrogant fool.' His secretary stormed the office, \"Are you alright, Reichskommissar?\" Hüttig took off his glasses.\n\"Read this!\", he said easefully.\n\n\"Once again\", Hüttig began his rant calmly, contradictory to the rage that was seething within, \"he displays his insufficiency to do what the Führer bestowed upon us three here. He is an incapable man who is unable to rule his Reichskommissariat.\" Something cracked. \"Schenck is an incompetent coward, disloyal to the party, and gets away with it. That is barely bearable for me!\" The spasm of pain of his fingernails digging his palm. \"But Müller openly displays his ineptitude! I hold evidence for it, just look at the letter! Nonetheless he is praised for his decent enforcement of German rule in Afrika by Germania!\" 'Meanwhile they forget the only one doing his bloody job'\n\n\"Sir?\", his secretary said reticently, \"Your glasses.\" Hüttig looked at his palm where a cracked spectacle frame lay next to splintered glasses. 'One day he'll bloody pay for it all. Him and Schenck'. He threw the broken glasses away. \"Bring me a typewriter\", Hüttig was calmer on the outside than usual, \"nobody will heed this letter any mind.

So much for your rant of my incapability.'\n\nAnother hit, directly splitting a whole sentence. Now it reads, \"...while you are working...\" instead of \"...while you are hunting, I am working...\" 'I give you that, I like hunting. But which man of common intellect wouldn't use this opportunity as I have? Alas for you, my work is praised nonetheless. Not yours! I was about to integrate you. I wanted to make friends. But I came to the conclusion you earned your shame, Hans. You can't even handle uprisings.'\n\nAnd another hit, tearing the letter in two. 'For a man with your ruthlessness, Hans, I thought you might want to be graced by glory as well.' Müller picked up the letter, examining it closely. 'What is it shunning you? My African Askari? Maybe. The Hunts? Everybody likes hunts. Schenck? No, he's a nice person, too nice. Me? Well, my temper can be ambivalent, my mother used to tell me. My special game? Hah, that definitely doesn't shun you ruthless bastard.'\n\"Fuck you, Hans! You are a mystery\", Müller exclaimed lightheartedly.\n\n'Is there currently no one special I haven't hunted with before?' He went to the balcony, gazing at the track vanishing in the wilderness. Red sand dreamfully moved by a breeze. 'Madagaskar. Bloody Maurice! Of course! He has some special creatures over there. I can invite him seeing mine. SS-Hüttig can't stand him, so double-fuck him.' He went to the typewriter, realization suddenly flooding him. 'He's much too far away.

He quickly marked it on the map as ordered and scuttled away.\n\nThe mercenary didn't like to be here, didn't want to be here, he was paid to be here. He knew he and his fellows were the best for the job because they were paid to make sense of the jungle. He didn't question when Siegfried Müller had sent them here, since he paid considerably well and promised bonuses for success. Their task was simple; he wanted them to find the most impressive animals in Africa's jungles to potentially hunt them. This would be something even Robert might enjoy.\n\nSquadrons of helicopters took off from the Reichskommissar's palace to disseminate above the jungle. Tiny helicopters; so tiny that three men barely fit into it barring the pilot. Each was stacked with two or three mercenaries from the hand-chosen commandos, experienced in the unforgiving terrain of the jungle. They were paid to mark Africa's best spots to hunt the jungle wildlife.\n\nTheir helicopter had landed on a plateau a night ago. Each mercenary went off for themself to find the biggest and most brutish beasts to mark the spots that promised the most money in bonuses. Every one of his company having arrived on the plateau they flew off to the Reichskommissar for the report again. Back there nobody asked about each other's successes, not even in their own units."

He was fascinated by the wildlife here, by the sparse vegetation, by the games the heat was playing here. He liked it, although he didn't exactly know why.

All of them gargantuan helicopters packed with veteran garrison troops of the scouting corps to search for the best hunting spots in the region with the best game. It was diverse here, from gentle giants to majestic beasts.\n\nThey arrived at the position they had agreed upon on time. While the helicopters had flown off to scout for impressive animals from the sky, several smaller squadrons of three men were to track down the animals on the basis of their paths on the ground respectively.\n\nThe other two squadrons seemed lucky as well, and when they arrived at Léopoldville early the next morning all but one of the helicopter crews had numerous markings on their maps."

Those mountains were not too far from the nominal border to Reichskommissariat Ostafrika and made for the breeding ground of some of the most famed highland as well as green savannah hunting spots in the dales, it was said.\n\nOn the other hand, his choice fell on the Virunga Mountains. Located slightly to the north a flight that would lead along the coast of the Congo Lake for some time.

The big hefty body of the mighty buffalo appeared in the crosshairs. Sluggish movement of the brown pelage sprinkled with water made Müller smile. He hovered over the bullish animal with his reticle for some time. Finally, its horns, shaped into impressively huge curls, appeared right in the middle. He had his desired target.

Savannah animals famed for their exalted appearance thanks to their impressive cornets. Sometimes man-tall colossi of horns shaped into slight springs. For their whole outward appearance, Müller used to call them Africa's deer with uncomplex and more impressive cornets.\n\nIn his office he pondered over the map where every mark his scouts had made were centralized for posterity. He swiftly identified the two spots he preferred for their plentifulness of the animal. He had to choose.\n\nOn the one hand there was the border territory of the Lower Chad savannah, crossing directly into the region frequently bombed from Windhuk. But so close to his own territory no bombardments were conducted. Well, he could also ask for the bombings to be stopped in the Chad region. Yet the savannah there made for the animal's preferred terrain and thus for a great hunting spot.\n\nOn the other hand, the Cunene province. Located deep into Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika's center; a flight that could be equally long and satisfying. His fellow Reichskommissar surely wouldn't mind him hunting there. Besides, someone had to keep his friend's wildlife in check.\n\nHe now had to choose where he would find the most impressive game and where he would have the most luck with the kudus."

Not as much as in the years prior but he was certain he could shame his past self by completely indulging into hunting for the next weeks as well. One animal prominently missed in the whole of his collection. He had shot yet only slain one of their kind; they were too robust. But he was confident this time. He'd hunt an elephant!\n\nIn his office he pondered over the map where every mark his scouts had made were centralized for posterity. He swiftly identified the two spots he preferred for their plentifulness of the animal. He had to choose.\n\nOn the one hand, there was the north-eastern bank of the Congo Lake which hosted a great range of savannah animals. It was one of the greener places of the usually believed to be dusty savannahs. The grassy savannah near the lake, recently trimmed from thick canopies could make for an excellent hunting spot. Maybe with a comfortable layover in Hitlerstadt.\n\nOn the other hand, his choice fell on the Bas-Uele again. A vast savannah that was a patchwork of grass and steppe. Far to the north-east of the Congo Lake, the long flight might pay off with a broad plentifulness of the animal. The savannah there made for its perfect breeding ground.\n\nHe now had to choose where he would find the most impressive game and where he would have the most luck with the enormous elephants."

Numerous of the highest-ranking veterans of the garrison, a contingent of natives of the Waffen-SS on a separate helicopter to provide for extra shooting power, the most legendary mercenaries of the famous group called 'the Predators', and a path tracker native to their hunting destination. Each of them was equipped with extra ammunition to slay at least one elephant. Müller knew from previous occasions that much ammo was needed to fell these monstrosities.\n\nEverything was ready!

Now the hunt was on.\n\nIt looked like a family of elephants. A few kids, one half-grown teen, a female, and an old male; at least Müller pictured it like that in his head. He made some gestures, providing the necessary orders to his crew. He and the veterans would go for the mightiest of the traveling group. The natives were supposed to circle the smaller ones and shoot as much of them as possible to satisfy the mercenaries that insisted to be paid in ivory. Therefore, 'the Predators' concerned themselves with hunting another group of elephants farther to the north. There were more of them, but all of them smaller. Yet Müller wanted the mightiest elephant head! Thus, he decided on this particular one.\n\nOne last gesture. They were ready.

Shot after shot it rose and sank down again, struggling with an unyielding will to survive. Everyone had reloaded by this point. Müller even thought about going for the head, yet he didn't want to besmirch his trophy. It finally fell for the last time in a long-drawn act of what could have been a staged death in a Shakespearean drama. Not that he ever read or saw one, but he imagined them like that. Finally, the dust settled.\n\nThey made the tallies on the ground. The female was about to flee out of their eyesight when 'the predators' appeared and slew the beast in a few shots. After adding her bloodied ivory to their reservoir, they greeted Müller with a bunch of smaller and bigger partially red-colored tusks backpacked. He had slain only one of these mighty creatures. Yet he had slain the biggest and wouldn't give the slightest cell of it away. Though they arrogantly asked for his acquired tusks, he sent them toward the killed younglings.\n\nMüller quickly took hold of one of the tusks and made certain they were his, engraving a small 'Siegfried' on one of them.

The grand collection, finally developing and shaping up to become something, and the head of the mightiest of the African wildlife complemented each other flawlessly. The elephant's head promised to let any visitor feel small and lost compared to its monstrous size.\n\nHe looked at the head before its positioning, made some small adjustments to the trophy, and began instructing the concierges. The Reichskommissar crossed his arms and proudly contemplated his work. He had slain this beast! What a story to tell. No one could flee it now with the magnificent elephant's head hanging there to force even the shyest visitor to ask for the hunting story.

Mostly of Müller's origin, the bullets seemingly didn't bother the animal at all, though. Staggeringly, it struggled its way out of the crossfire and was lost soon thereafter. Looking to the left he could see the natives having more luck with the younglings, only one of them escaping the bullets. Suddenly Müller remembered the female! But before being able to shoot again, one of the 'predators' waved from her dead back at Müller.\n\nHe sent some of his men searching for the male on the ground. Müller just didn't want to return empty-handed, because he refused to integrate underdeveloped youngling heads into his grand collection. Either way, their grandeur was gutted by 'the predators', claiming their ivory prize. They even refused to hand over the female's head whole, although they had enough tusks from the group they successfully hunted, enraging Müller for just a minute.\n\nHe returned to his companions, glooming about this unlucky hunt.

One day, he'll hunt a mighty elephant. But for now, Müller just wanted to get rid of 'the predators' in his vicinity, potentially thwarting his plans again. Therefore, he released some stress by shooting any game he saw on the way back.

 COG_hunt.2110.desc:0 "Josef Mengele, Hauptabteilungsleiter für Afrikanische Politik of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika - essentially acting as a foreign minister, just took his leave from Siegfried Müller on the helipad after an important meeting. They shook each other's hand with throttled rancor palpable in the doctor's eyes. It was merely a boring meeting about some already doomed treaty but this snob played himself like an exalted representative. Thus, Müller examined the brought gift after the obnoxious man's vehicle was nowhere to be seen anymore. And its quickly recognizable color pattern gave him a much more exciting thought immediately: a hunt.\n\nIn his remote office at Hitlerstadt he pondered over the map where every mark his scouts had made was centralized for posterity. He swiftly identified the two spots he preferred for their plentifulness of the animal he wanted to hunt. He had to choose where he'd have the most luck with a giraffe. Unfortunately, the most impressive examples were predominantly found in Hüttig's Ostafrika.\n\nOn the one hand there was the Serengeti. A flight that would take him beyond yet another lake and deep in Ostafrika's north. That Idyllic savannah with its prominent grass landscapes would certainly find him an impressive savannah.\n\nOn the other hand, his choice fell on the Akagera. Located before the aforementioned lake yet similarly within Hüttig's Reichskommissariat. Not too dissimilar from the Serengeti, the giraffe was to be found here in plenty as well..\n\nHe now had to choose where he'd hunt the giraffes. However, he had to keep in mind where he was going. Hans Hüttig was anything but friendly towards Müller and it wasn't unlikely this hunt would see him stirring up the most dangerous predator on the African continent."

Though boring to the onlooker's eye, Müller found some joy in it.\n\nThere was always the option to choose from the classical hunting equipment. Used decades ago and being just as effective back then. It consisted of older weaponry, something that Müller's grandfather might have fought with. Yet it was reliable as it not only included knives but also devices used in ancient times to read an animal's tracks.\n\nBut he could also choose from modern hunting weaponry. It relied on a range of the newest support devices to make for the perfect kill. It was impressive, heavy and efficient.\n\nHowever, the modern equipment greatly differed from the older, as it lacked its allrounder abilities. Yet the old equipment often failed to make a hunt swift and effective, with robust animals often escaping before the deadly shot.\n\nMüller now wondered what he could slay such a big majestic creature like a giraffe with. On the other hand, he also had to keep in mind that he was very much preparing to leave his comfort zone."

Furthermore, he planned a helicopter route that would lead through the territory Hüttig had the least control of - hah, there were a lot to choose from in that regard. He just hoped that the damn partisans wouldn't meddle with his hunt.\n\nMüller went around the Hitlerstadt garrison to gather a crew of the most experienced scouting corps members and excellent marksmen, completing his crew by including his personal guards. This time there were neither natives nor mercenaries allowed; he needed absolute, unyielding trust in his crew.\n\nEverything was ready! The Reichskommissar rubbed his hands at the thought of slaying a majestic giraffe soon. He pictured it right in front of him; aiming at the speckled fur of this tall creature with its filigree head on an enormous neck. Him approaching after the deadly blow and fascinated by the exalted aura it would soon radiate in his grand collection.\n\nHowever, this hunt had to account for multiple factors.

They found the true purpose of the hunt!\n\nA group of tall and majestic giraffes grazing between a set of savannah trees, their shading crowns delivering the perfect image of what Africa was all about. Müller was silent for a minute, reminiscent of all his hunts prior. There was almost a tiny spark of regret that he had brutally destroyed such beautiful sceneries before. But no! He reminded himself that his hunting trophies were perpetual captions of these sceneries.\n\nHe firmly took hold of his rifle and silently barked orders to put his decided on method of approach strategy into action. The big bodies gracefully moved to take their nibbles on the grass. Movements that made Müller grin before he started aiming in his opted position. He hovered over the majestic animal with his reticle for some time. Finally, he chose which one he'd go for. He had his desired target.

One of the giraffes attempting to flee was horribly penetrated by several bullets, yet succeeded to ultimately heave itself to safety. The other two escaped nearly unharmed. The deed was done; the victory Müller's. He was even surprised himself how smoothly it all went down. Now it was about time to claim the trophy.\n\nThey approached the dead animal on the ground. Step after step Müller's grin widened. He was happy beyond belief. He had only slain one giraffe once, very early in his Reichskommissarship. He had hunted them after a meeting in Salisbury, without permission. While Hüttig actually could never have known about it since the Reichskommissariats were still in the buildup, he made some queer comments about giraffes at their next meeting. He probably knew this time as well; this time it was an intrusion on top.\n\nMüller quickly gave the orders to help him cut out the trophy. He wanted to be out of Ostafrika as swiftly as possible.

Hüttig himself would never arrange the 'accidental' shooting of a Zentralafrikaner helicopter that bore the marks of the higher echelons. Yet on the other hand...\n\nHe shook it all away. Instead he focused on finding the perfect positioning for this majestic trophy. Including parts of the giraffe's long neck, it was the largest so far. Thus, the options were limited. Once hooked up, Müller again proudly contemplated the hunts. By now he had come to the realization that the hunting season wouldn't allow for many more impressive trophies. The grand collection would have to wait for a few months, but the occasional casual hunt wouldn't have to. All prior trophies standing witness he swore to continue the grand collection to capture the African wildlife in all plenty as soon as the constellations would align again.\n\nWhile he patted the giraffe's long neck with absent thoughts, a clerk entered the room hastily. \"A call for the Reichskommissar.

Müller took a deep breath when they beckoned his hunting crew. They met on the ground. His crew of a dozen, and roughly the same number in Ostafrikaner SS with some additional English garrison volunteers standing sentinel.\n\nThey informed them they were on regular patrol duty and needed to search their belongings. Müller tried to clarify who he was, but the Obergruppenführer's response was merely another smile directly into his face. Müller knew he had to let them check him and his crew or this could end very badly. The blonde Obergruppenführer circled them during the inspection and went through some formal documents for the procedure.\n\n\"We're glad to be of help to such a famous personality as you, Herr Reichskommissar.\" He handed back the documents. \"This region is dangerous to the higher echelons, but no need to thank us.

However, he also knew under different circumstances Hüttig's response could have been completely different.\n\nThe Obergruppenführer insisted that two of his men would have to fly on Müller's helicopter to the border, while theirs guided them.

He'd invite his good friend, Général Jacques Massu, for a gregarious hunt. Just like the old days...\n\nHe'd finally have to pay him back for this cheating of his at the card game from their last meeting of a calmer manner. He'd also had many games with him of fiercer nature for sure. He'd also had a few games of the roughest nature alongside him, but this refers to the game of life and death. Hah, the good old days... clear in Müller's memory as ever. How could he forget those days with the man he'd dubbed \"my long lost brother\".\n\nSiegfried Müller slumped into his chair from the efforts of the early morning. Now it'd come to the greatest effort of his. Forming nice words for a neat letter to invite his friend. But he shits on the stuff his bureaucrats tried to force down his throat. Müller knows Massu, and Massu knows Müller. He'd forgive him some errors with his French, or some more colloquial brusqueness.

So, he went inside the airport to get into a cleaner military garb for the happy occasion, carefully attaching the Iron Cross to his breezy camouflage coat.\n\nWhen he was entering the tarmac again Rolf Steiner was arriving with a grand guard of honor, encompassing his finest veterans and many that served once before under Massu in the French remnant. They were all garbed so formally and pretentious. Had he chosen the wrong uniform? He laughed that off. Massu wouldn't mind some informalities or two.\n\nThe distant noise of an aircraft heading for Léopoldville airport was coming closer. His anticipation grew with every tone the aircraft's humming augmented. Then finally the squeaking on the tarmac with the wheels hitting the runway. The privately owned aircraft took its circle, and Müller's anticipation grew unbearable.\n\nThe jetway finally docked, the door opened, and the Général stepped into the hot air, heat haze above the tarmac making the onlookers dizzy. Massu was much too pompously garbed in his finest uniform. Fuck this bragging idiot.\n\nMüller approached with long strides and immediately embraced Massu in a tight brotherly hug, cutting the 'bise' ostensibly short. \"Brother\", they greeted each other in unison, pulling their foreheads together. Having their arms swung around the other's shoulder they walked down to Rolf Steiner, flanked by the guard of highest honor.

Even if they didn't comprehend the language the other used, they would possibly still understand each other.\n\nWhen Müller, already a bit drunk, and Massu, still sober, hopped off at the government complex, they entered in for a night of garrulous conversations: Massu updated Müller on the current situation in the French remnants, fitting in an anecdote here and there. Müller, very drunk at this point, elaborated on his many hunts since their last meeting and on the hunts before their last meeting, of course. He talked about exquisite creatures, gossiped about the other Afrikan Reichskommissars, and recalled the heroism of the two's last stand near a Cameroon entrenchment, both enjoying fighting more than commanding back then, before the helicopter picked them up.\n\nNeither of the two slept for the whole night, drinks and their laughter keeping them awake.

But Müller, of course, ordered a detour to reminisce about the good old times with Massu and possibly bring them back to life a bit longer.\n\nWithout the slightest trace of fatigue after their long nocturnal talk, the two eagerly hopped on the helicopter. Yet again in a torrent of rowdy laughter, Müller made promises of great game he and Massu would hunt this day. Already reminiscent of their last hunt, when they were in hot pursuit of a big mountain gorilla, they talked themselves into a frenzy, while their device of transportation was slowly hovering away under great noise and a whirlwind of red-colored earth, the rotor blades creating a cool breeze.\n\nAs they were lifted higher into the air, their vigorous talk still didn't abate. Mainly Müller was talking, because Massu was carried away by the beauty of Zentralafrika he so long yearned to see once again. The Général was getting a bit drowsy by the constant humming of the machine and the landscape rolling past. Müller, meanwhile, was vigorous as ever - either energized by the alcohol or by the idea of hunting with his dear friend.\n\nAs Massu's eyelids shut close, Müller grinned.

It only got funnier when they reminisced about their first meetings during the wars with Cameroon where a similar challenge was involved - though game of another kind was shot...\n\nThey couldn't even look at each other without laughing or grinning when Massu spotted something in his canthus. Something white grazing on a plain mound. Müller noticed and followed his friend's gaze. They moved to the skids.\n\nMüller nearly shrieked with overexcitement and pulled Massu tight to his body in the same instance.

Gulping the icy cold liquid Müller was still grinning from his second contest triumph of the day. It was very close... if Massu had only plunged the last bullet into the correct body part of the big brutish white rhinoceros.\n\nMüller scuttled away, hastily doffing his clothes, to jump into the pool. The Reichskommissar looked at the Général expectantly. Massu shook his head, mumbled to himself, and took off his clothes. The heat had been implacable, after all. Müller greeted him with a splash of water. Their comfortably cold bath had them reminisce the time their boat ran out of fuel on the Congo Lake.\n\nThey settled into the biggest suite of the complex for the night. They got everything they hoped for, starting off with a lavish dinner. The two were gradually getting drunker by the minute. With the increasing inebriation, their party turned into an actual orgy. They invited guests, both men and women, from other rooms, played one game after the other, challenged each other to ludicrous contests, and had a nocturnal swim in the pool. Soon the whole hotel was awake, but Müller's authority prevented any retaliation. In fact, the games only turned rowdier and naughtier from there on. Müller, who had drunk several men unconscious by this point, got into a quarrel with a husband over his wife. The Reichskommissar nearly cut the fight short by planting a bullet in the man's head before Massu's intervention.\n\nThe party swiftly dispersed after this.

This was the opportunity for Massu to take a trip around the island and enjoy the day's relatively merciful sun.\n\nJust when the Général returned, Müller finally woke up, though in considerably worse shape than the day before. He seemed very baffled at first, but when they embarked on the helicopter, their things long loaded onto it, the realization gradually reemerged.\n\nThis flight was jovial at first as Müller still seemed a bit drunk, at least he behaved like it. But with the gradual passing of time, Müller sunk back into his baffled state. However, Massu didn't worry the least. This night's bender left the Reichskommissar better off than after their first common victory in the Cameroon Conflicts.\n\nMassu reminisced about these good old times with an increasingly broader grin, while he also enjoyed the wild landscape.

The Reichskommissar and his friend won, of course.\n\nAfterward, their time was already long due. Thus, they found themselves here on the tarmac, Massu's aircraft waiting for him. Rolf Steiner said his farewells to Massu, still with the formal distance. Müller accompanied him to the entry. One last tight brotherly hug. One last time staring deep into each other's eye. One last remark on a hopefully more imminent reunion this time. One last pull on Massu's neck. One last sad grin at Müller.\n\nOne last goodbye...\n\nSiegfried Müller sullenly turned to clear the aircraft's door. Jacques Massu entered the vehicle, something glistening in the corner of his eye. Yet both felt the heartening anticipation of their next reunion."

 COG_hunt.311.desc:0 "The Reichskommissar was coming back from a helicopter flight cut short by an implacable gust of rain. Soaked through to the bones, he hopped off his vehicle, splashing in a puddle of muddy water splattering the impeccable trousers of a bystanding bureaucrat. Müller absently grabbed for the pile of documents the man in the disturbingly big glasses was holding out for him and cut him off with a wave of his grimy hand before his incomprehensible babble began. In a thick Bavarian accent, the bureaucrat talked about things that Müller was loathsomely obliged to know about yet felt completely apathetic about, nonetheless. Strange how things that seemingly blinded the vision for the actual life were dictating the course of history.\n\nChanging the course of history in a monotone manner, completely disregarding the fact that one's life passed still... faster and faster... until you realize your fate was sealed long ago by the decisions you made. By the things you said, the thoughts you had, the action you took.\n\nSiegfried Müller was speaking right now, evoking a thought, inducing an action. Life was passing, but he wanted to seal his fate himself.\n\nThe message was being prepared for Jacques Massu, Müller's dearest and most trusted friend in what was the course of his life. But what has it still in store? One thing changes and the world is another place. Yes, those were the thoughts that determined life rather than impeccable behavior, precise knowledge of figures and service to some state that is bound to the same rules as men, just of a longer timespan.\n\nMüller was certainly worried about his future and he wanted to speak and think about it with his good friend to take the action that would seal a fate worthy of a man that thought like the Reichskommissar."

 COG_hunt.312.desc:0 "The message was carried to the Reichskommissar in a swift pace, while his foot was resting on the back of his truck, his rifle playing pillar for his head, confusedly eyeing his latest work as seen by the frown above his brows. The bureaucrat stopped puffingly. He nearly collapsed as he presented the message, staggering noticeably. Müller, with a widening grin of glee for the unnecessary marathon this boring warrior of words and figures had to conduct, was moving towards his latest prey. Stooping to pick it up something the messenger read caught his attention.\n\nThe fate that you sealed...\n\nHe turned from the carcass to demand the origin of the message. Jacques Massu. Yes... yes, he agreed to return. Müller's mood immediately skyrocketed, making him nearly jump and exclaim like a child given this gift that they always wished for and never stopped niggling about.\n\nYes, Massu agreed to return. A pleasantly sooner reunion than between the last occasion and the Lake incident... Regardless, the Reichskommissar's worries and grueling thoughts may finally be laid aside."
 COG_hunt.312.a:0 "Laid aside for the better, hopefully..."
 COG_hunt.313.t:0 "Jacques Arrives at the Palace"
 COG_hunt.313.desc:0 "It all resembled the last occasion. An elaborate motorcade, extensive columns of honor guards, and a wary Steiner. It all resembled the last occasion but for a slightly late Reichskommissar himself. Instead of waiting on the beaming hot tarmac an hour before Massu's arrival, Müller kept lying in bed worryingly longer than usual. He cradled his head in his hands for elapsing minute after minute, nervously fiddling at his brows with the tips of his fingers, putting much effort in elaborating the worries about his future, and suppressing thoughts seemingly a lifetime away.\n\nJacques Massu was already halfway down the aisle the honor guard, composed of apt mercenaries and experienced garrison troops, when Müller approached his dear friend with long strides. Thoroughly confused by the rash hug from his considerably shaggy friend, unkempt hair, unbuttoned uniform and all, the jovial Müller regained something that he had seemingly lost in the course of a week: His smile.\n\nYet it vanished abnormally quickly for a friend can still disappoint his brother... his brother in arms in the Heights, on the Plateau, on the Lake... his brother in thought on the area of warfare, of the conduct of life... his brother in terms of ambition, pursuit of their goals and, most importantly, of their unique, often despised, way of handling things.\n\nHis brother until death if he means to be it. Whether theirs or someone else's is still up to debate.\n\n\"Willkommen, mon ami! We have much to discuss. And I feel some minor urgency tingling in my guts.\" Thus, Müller abruptly pushed Massu down the aisle."
 COG_hunt.313.a:0 "His worries may be ours..."
 COG_hunt.314.t:0 "Der Pakt?"
 COG_hunt.314.desc:0 "\"You know, Jacques. I've been thinking a lot lately. Stuff's going on everywhere that made me question my decisions.\" Müller began with an undertone of melancholy as he poured an expensive brandy, produced and sold solely in the US and always gifted to him by one of the generous American investors. He sat down next to his friend and looked at him with an obviously forced smile. \"And I have the feeling you may be the only one who truly understands me. None of these pencil-pushers would comprehend my worries as you could.\"\n\nMassu has never seen his endeared friend so somber. Not once in their so very long friendship has he been so joyless. He either smiled and laughed or smirked to himself about some naughty thing he has thought up. His worries must have been critically imminent. Massu laid his hand on Müller's shoulder. The absent Reichskommissar flinched before realizing whose reassuring hand it was.\n\"What is it, mon ami. We can fix it together.\"\n\nMüller sighed. \"This one day, coming back from an abortive meeting, I looked at this young Bavarian bureaucrat in my service. And... Well, I always laughed at them for their obscenely accurate behavior, but... but that day I pitied him. Not only him, all my civil servants. Their life's passing as they gear towards the success of a rusting system, of a rusting world of monotone decision-making.\" Müller's voice started to crack in desperation. \"Then I realized that even I am a part of this system. That my life is passing in front of me, while I make meaningless decisions in this dreary monstrosity of governance I thought I would find joy in. If not joy in representing my country, joy in the wildlife or whatever...\"\n\n\"Jacques, I am lost. I want to make a meaningful decision. I thought that in case this sorry Reichskommissariat refuses to let me enjoy my life, I could hop over to your lodge in the French remains. We'd be together and could enjoy our lives, finally. I'd be rid of this burden. We could be warriors again... of fortune and glory\" Müller looked at his brotherly friend in hopeful anticipation. He knew he was asking much."
 COG_hunt.314.a:0 "But was it too much?"
 COG_hunt.315.t:0 "Le Pacte"
 COG_hunt.315.desc:0 "Müller was still looking at the floor, ashamed for how all this lamentation must have looked to Massu. He felt he was on the verge of overstraining their friendship. Yet he couldn't live like that. Though Massu was his brother, he had to worry about his own life still. But was that really a reason or just another meaningless decision he had rendered.\n\nMassu was shaken by how devastated his friend was. His voice, his articulation... there might even have been tears in the corners of his eyes. He was asking much, but he was his friend. No, his brother. And in a serious state, besides. While others wouldn't understand Müller's thinking to abandon the powerful position of Reichskommissar, Massu knew how very endeared an adventurous life was to Siegfried Müller. Even the Général himself would often find himself abandoning his country for his personal gain. One can't leave his brother like that, for he wouldn't be his brother otherwise.\n\n\"From now on I'll have the parcel next to mine reserved for you. In case you decide to retire, we can enjoy life together.\" There it was again, unusually wide and with a spark of surprise: Müller's smile. \"While I can't disregard the obligations I have, I will always have time for my brother. Then we are not lone warriors anymore, but fight side by side for whatever cause until our song has been sung.\"\n\nThey sealed their pact with a jovial celebration to the ringing of their glasses filled with brandy. Müller, now in something similar to his old mood, would take some time to consider his position in Zentralafrika. At the dawn of the conclusion he'd from now on have the option to retire in Free French territory and make his life meaningful. He and his brother could finally enjoy themselves from then on without the toils of state rivalry or Müller's harnessing obligations.\n\nNothing could break this pact now, for it was sealed in brotherly concord."
 COG_hunt.315.a:0 "But could really nothing break it?"
 COG_hunt.316.t:0 "Send Out the Invitations"
 COG_hunt.316.desc:0 "His pen tapped furiously against his desk as Siegfried Müller thought of what to do. Across from him stood his trophy wall, adorned with animal heads from all over Africa. They stared down at his plight, silently mocking him. After all, Siegfried was in a position he had never even dreamed of being in- he was getting tired of hunting.\n\nIt seemed impossible that the man who spent a majority of his time hunting could ever get tired of hunting, but it was true. It felt as if it was the same old trip every time: pick a place, fly out, shoot, fly back. The monotony of something he had once loved tore at his heart. He could not give up such an important release of his. He needed some way of breaking the routine that he had entered.\n\nSuddenly, an idea came to him- why not invite some new acquaintances along? Not just any friends, no- people he wanted to grow closer to, both politically and personally. After all, having new friends in powerful places can never be a bad thing.\n\nAs he wrote, three men came to mind. The first, Ladoke Akintola, was the leader of the warlord state of Yorubaland, and a man Müller wished to sell more weapons to. The second, Patrice Lumumba, was a popular local politician in Zentralafrika. His influence with the native populace would be helpful for the colony, and for sales. Finally, Leonard Mulamba, leader of the Zentralafrikan-SS. The man himself seemed interesting enough, and having the leader of the SS on Müller's side could only be a positive.\n\nWith the stroke of a pen, the three letters were finished with flourished, and each was fast tracked to their destination. Müller sat back, imagining the great hunt that would soon come with his new friends. He could already feel that old fire of his burning hot and bright again. It was safe to say he could not wait for the responses."

 COG_hunt.320.desc:0 "\"To my esteemed friend, Ladoke Akintola. I, Siegfried Müller, humbly invite you to join me on my next hunt.\"\n\nLadoke Akintola did a double take when he first skimmed this line of the letter embossed with a glossy stamp of Hitler himself adorning the envelope, reading it again in confusion. An invitation to hunt with the Reichskommissar himself? It was not something Ladoke had come to expect. Besides that, to call Akintola and Müller \"Esteemed friends\" was a bit of an overstatement, to put it lightly. Akintola himself wasn't sure if he had ever said more than a sentence to Müller. In fact, up until this moment, all the relations between the Reichskommissariat and Yorubaland had been purely business-related. For such a sudden change of heart to occur was very... interesting.\n\nAkintola's first instinct was to refuse outright. After all, it couldn't possibly be true that Müller had gone out of his way to invite him to Zentralafrika solely for the purpose of hunting, could it? However, something pulled at the back of his mind, urging him to go along. No part of the letter could really be construed as threatening, and why would Müller wish to interfere with the politics of a nation such as Yorubaland? For a moment, Ladoke pondered his options."

The envelope, a plain white one with no symbol upon it, contrasted sharply to the ceremonial ones that Müller had sent out. Müller's smile grew wide and large as he tore open the envelope, anxious to see the response.\n\nUnfortunately, it was not the response he was hoping for.\n\nMüller's smile was quickly replaced with a mix between a grimace and a frown as he read the bad news- Akintola would not be joining him on his hunt. Citing a mix of \"security reasons\" and \"a need for strong leadership\", Akintola explained his predicament in no uncertain terms, though he certainly said he would if he could. Müller wasn't sure if he believed him or not. Disappointed, he tossed the envelope aside, where it landed in a pile of old colonial reports. It was certainly a shame to miss out on the man- he seemed like an interesting fellow, for sure. However, there were still two others, and Müller now eagerly awaited what he hoped would be a more positive response."

Surprisingly enough, Akintola had enthusiastically accepted Müller's offer. It was something that Müller had certainly not expected, but he wasn't one to complain. At least he had one acquaintance to make friends with.\n\nStill smiling, Müller stood up to grab the bottle of whiskey at the corner of his table. As he poured a glass of the drink, he looked out into the wilderness of the jungle that lay outside of the city limits. Soon he would return to its green embrace, and he would be bringing a friend along."

 COG_hunt.323.desc:0 "The old JU-88, with a swastika proudly displayed on the side for all to see, roared loudly in the background as Akintola addressed the crowd. Inside, the two German pilots waited impatiently as their passenger grandstanded to the cheering crowds. It had been much time since the pilots had risked their lives landing on the cratered mess that, at least theoretically, styled itself as a runway. Since then, they had been sitting in their seats, watching as Akintola shouted to his people. If the pilots had spoken the language of Yorubaland, and perhaps had been a hundred feet closer, they would have understood why he was taking his time.\n\nQuestions were shot at Akintola like a machine gun, as the many citizens around him questioned why their leader would visit with those who bombed them on a regular basis. No matter how many times he spoke of the benefits of close relations with Germany, no matter how many times he spoke honey about how the people of Yorubaland would no longer be troubled with poverty and destruction, it seemed that nobody would listen. On the other hand, perhaps nobody could hear him over the noise of the plane, since the questions kept being repeated by different people in different places in the crowd. After the same question was asked for the 4th time, Akintola evidently had enough, and made his way up the steps into the cabin.\n\nThere, a full kit of camouflage, a Panama hat, a rifle, and multiple boxes of ammo sat waiting for him. As the plane bumped its way into the air, Akintola sighed with relief. Perhaps he really could enjoy himself on this trip."

The runways of Léopoldville, which normally were jam-packed with foreign planes taking loads of cargo out of Zentralafrika, was abnormally quiet as the transport plane coasted to a stop. For a moment, there was silence as the propellers wound down, and Akintola wondered what was going on.\n\nIt did not take him long to find out.\n\nThe staircase outfitted on the bomber opened with a crack, and a military band, dressed in full dress uniform, began to play German marching tunes as loud as they could. In front of the band stood Siegfried Müller himself, with his trademark smile as wide as could be. As Akintola gingerly made his way down to the tarmac, Müller practically bounced over to greet him.\n\nFor a moment, the two hunters conversed jovially, before Müller escorted Akintola to the nearest Volkswagen. Within minutes, the car had travelled from the tarmac to the palace, where all the fineries of Africa were loaded upon the guest. Akintola himself had not seen such sheer wealth since the days of the English colonists, and even then he had only been a passive observer from afar. Even as the President, he had never had such fineries as the ones that were seemingly tossed at him.\n\nHowever, before he could truly get down to enjoying the riches of Zentralafrika, he found himself being practically dragged to the nearest helicopter by a seemingly ecstatic Müller. Before he knew it, they were in the air. Both men readied their rifles, eagerly awaiting the start of the hunt."

How many does that make?\"\n\n\"That's the 2nd rhino, and I got 2 lions earlier, so 4!\"\n\n\"God help me, I need to catch up!\" Akintola laughed as he sighted another creature below the helicopter- a lion, perhaps? As he steadied his scope, he heard Müller speak behind him.\n\n\"You know, Akintola, I was hoping that perhaps we could sell a few more anti-aircraft weapons to your army than normal, you know. Increase the order a little bit. What say you?\"\n\nAnother crack split the air, and Akintola watched as the lion's head snapped back before the majestic beast staggered, its regal form holding itself high one last time before tipping over.\n\n\"It's a deal.\""

The doors swung open to reveal Müller and Akintola, with rifles held high in one hand and various animal corpses in the other. The smiles that crossed their faces as they dismounted from the helicopter were visible even from the other side of the runway. The attendants strained to catch the conversation between the two men as they made their away towards them.\n\n\"...always good to spend time in the Kongo- I must say, Müller, it was a pleasure to hunt with you.\"\n\n\"The pleasure was all mine, President. How about another hunt sometime?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course.\"\n\n\"I have always wanted a closer relationship with some of our West African neighbors. This is only the start, of course. Now, I believe you have a plane to catch.\"\n\nAkintola smiled again before lightly stepping up the staircase and into the airplane. In a few minutes, the runway was cleared and the plane rose gently off the ground. The last thing Akintola could make out on the ground before the plane rose above the clouds was the figure of Müller, still waving happily."

The various droplets of blood, brain matter, and other gore that comes with being violently killed had been cleaned extensively, though one could still spot a few faint stains of red if they looked hard enough. Akintola sat back and admired his handiwork. It had been quite the shot for a man like him, judging by the long, long time it had been since his last hunt. Not only that, he had made the shot from a helicopter, something he had never done before. Truly, it was an achievement.\n\nAnd yet, as he thought about the whole excursion, he couldn't help but wonder what the point of it was. Why did Müller invite him along, anyway? Was it really just to sell a few more rifles and guns? Did he really mean it when he said he wished to be closer to West Africa, or was he simply trying to impress? Was there another reason to all of this?\n\nOr did Müller just genuinely want a new friend?\n\nWhatever the reason, one thing that couldn't be questioned was the quality of the lion Akintola had shot. He decided he'd focus on that, rather than any pesky underlying motive. After all, how much could a simple hunting trip really mean?"

Müller did not expect much from the SS man, in terms of hunting, but perhaps he would surprise him on the trip.\n\nHe surprised Müller a lot earlier than he expected, when Müller opened the letter to see that he had turned the offer down.\n\nThe reasons given were, to put it lightly, vague. The short, concise prose typed onto the paper gave excuse after excuse, ranging from \"A need to focus on work\" to \"a commitment to duty\", which Müller could have interpreted as a genuine excuse or a thinly veiled insult. Whatever the reasons, the end result was clear- Mulamba would not be joining the trip. A disappointment, for sure, but how much fun could an SS man have been in the first place?"

Unlike Mulamba, who disguised his reasoning under layers of vague excuses, Lumumba made it plain and simple for Müller: His reputation as a man of the people would be irrevocably damaged if he was even seen with the Reichskommissar, let alone hunting with him. Such a blunt response surprised Müller- normally, when he was turned down, they at least made the effort to be kind about it. However, something about the sheer insolence of the letter amused him. It was rare to find a man so willing to stand up to Müller. With a chuckle masking his hint of disappointment, he tossed the letter to the side. It really was a shame that Lumumba would not come along- a man with the gall to refuse his overlord so readily would certainly be one Müller would like to meet."

'레 아프뢰'는 그들을 추적하여, 반란군이 한 명이라도 숨어 있을 것으로 추정되는 모든 마을을 불태워댔다. 그리고, 그들이 원하는 것을 모조리 약탈해 갔으며, 죄 없는 민간인들은 참혹하게 학살당했다.\n\n일단 반란군 문제는 해결되었으나, 이제 더 심각한 문제가 찾아왔다. 현지에서 백인에 대한 증오심은 사상 최대 규모까지 커졌으며, 이제 반군 한 명이 죽은 만 큼 10명의 반란군이 생겨나려 하고 있었다. 사실 '레 아프뢰'는 방황하고 있었다. 슈타이너는 이들이 그들의 식민지를 뺐긴 충격에 휩싸인 자들이라는 것을 잘 알고 있었으며, 자신들의 조국, 자신들의 가족, 그리고 자신들의 문화가 부르군트에게 완전히 절멸 당한 충격으로 광기에 휩싸인 자들이라는 것을 잘 알고 있었다. 그 증오를 독일에게 풀 수 없게 되자, 그들은 원주민들에게 총검을 들이대고, 군화로 모든 아이들의 얼굴을 짓밟고, 총구를 이용해 그들의 성욕, 그리고 분노를 풀어댔다. 슈타이너는 이런 모순에 대해 생각함을 멈추었다. 만일 그 소문이 사실이라면, 그들(그 전에 이들이 사람이란 존재로 불릴 수가 있다면)은 아마 자신이 그토록 경멸하는 부르군트와 똑같은 자들로 전락하게 되었을 지도 모른다."

 COG_mercs.5.t:0 "Diamond Conveying Mission"
 COG_mercs.5.desc:0 "Mining in the Kongo is primarily conducted by 3 corporations: BCK, UMHK, and the Forminère. However, one true force dominates above all others: violence. From forcibly conscripted labor, to the hellish working conditions and the scars on the earth which the mines leave behind-danger abounds, and no one escapes unharmed. But the most dangerous job of all is transporting products along the colony's rickety jungle roads to the ports of the Kongo Meer. Considering the staggering number of mercenaries employed as guards and overseers, these trips often turn into firefights as the three leading companies license their men to engage in a bloody form of cutthroat competition, while paying us to look the other way.\n\nFor critical missions, like moving Uranium, the state will provide airlift or SS troops. But in all other circumstances, companies have to pay for the privilege of hiring out security. Private wars demand private armies...but there's nothing stopping us from making a quick buck on the side as a middleman. To that end, Forminère has just requested we provide security for an upcoming diamond convoy from Kasai, and were kind enough to forward a rather large \"insurance copayment.\" All of the major mercenaries have permanent contracts with one firm or the others, so we will have to turn to more minor outfits to meet their needs.\n\nBob Denard, a major Forminère contractor, has recommended the eager French Officer Philippe Erulin and his group of paratroopers experienced in unconventional warfare. Then there's \"Duck\" van der Linde; a relative newcomer who has recently crossed the border from South Africa to enter the business. He has already made quite a name for himself for his bravery in combat, and this mission could be his big break. Finally, there's the more conservative Pat Smith, a by-the-book if uncreative officer we've long employed to train our local troops, and who has always proven capable of following his orders to a Tee."

 COG_mercs.6.t:0 "Diamond Conveying Mission - Erulin's Report"
 COG_mercs.6.desc:0 "In concert with secret intelligence from Denard, Captain Philippe Erulin devised a strategy he called \"Le Troyen\", which consisted of positioning most of his small band of heavily armed men in unremarkable trucks masquerading as part of the Forminère convoy. At each mine, he had the cargo trucks pick up crates of blasting explosives rather than diamonds. Finally, on some dusty road, the long-awaited ambush arrived as two armed men ran into the path of the lead truck. They demanded the driver stop, and he meekly complied, exiting his vehicle with his hands above his head.\n\nAs one man led the captured driver toward the jungle, a group of mercs left their positions in the treeline to search the truckbed and capture the rest of the convoy. Once enough of them were near, Erulin triggered the explosives in the back of the now-empty lead truck as his men poured out of their vehicles, launching a counter-ambush of their own. In a few minutes, the robbery had devolved into a rout. Erulin ordered his men to slacken their fire; these were fellow mercs, after all. Besides, he needed his opponents alive for his plan to come to fruition.\n\nIt worked brilliantly, as word spread like brushfire that Forminère was booby-trapping its trucks. The psychological damage far outstripped the losses that Eurlin had inflicted on the BCK and UHMK. Forminère got its convoy through, and then the next five, and within a few months felt confident enough to actually start running convoys without escorts. Fear alone had become the deterrent. Ironically, it seemed like the threat of extreme violence may be what finally put an end to the endless mercenary raids. This could never be allowed to stand, of course; the idea of the companies reaping all of the Congo's vast profits for themselves without paying for protection? Impossible! Steiner sent the telegrams himself: to observers in Germania, they seemed to be innocuous customs regulations on the private movement of blasting explosives. To the companies on the ground, they suddenly made the Le Troyen approach cost prohibitive. Within a few days, the ambush rate-and funding for the government-had spiked to unprecedented levels."

 COG_mercs.7.desc:0 "When the soldier waltzed into the Forminère camp and demanded to see the mercenary leader, Duck knew he had problems. First, somehow this disheveled man had managed to slip past his sentries unnoticed. Brave as they may be, many of Duck's men were inexperienced youngsters, out for adventure or fortune but with very little practical knowledge of soldiering. Second, the fact this man had found their camp at all suggested the enemy knew more about Duck than he did about them.\n\nThe man was a deserter, and he claimed the UMHK task force was just a day's march away, ready to ambush the convoy as soon as it left camp. If he'd get a cut of the diamonds, he'd guide Duck and his men to the spot during a night raid to clear a path for the convoy.\n\nAlmost as soon as the platoon set out that night, the plan went to hell. Suddenly guns roared from the jungle on all sides as the \"deserter\" slipped off to join his comrades, now laying into the South Africans with a hellish crossfire. Duck realized the only way out of the ambush was to charge through it, back down the jungle path where they had come. He drew his machete, called for the retreat, and took up point leading his men back to safety. By the time the unit returned to camp, half their men were missing, including many carrying modern battle rifles.\n\nAs dawn broke the next morning, Duck's men, cradling old wartime bolt-action rifles or even homemade muskets, looked out onto a ring of mercenaries on all sides. A solitary figure swaggered up the dirt road toward the surrounded camp, as the UMHK mercenary leader stepped forward to offer his terms of surrender. \"That was a brave thing you did, kid, but it's hopeless to fight us off. Hand over the diamonds, and we'll let you out alive. We will be ruined from getting a contract of your own if you surrender, but I tell you what; you're brave sons-of-bitches, and you treated my infiltrator well. How's about you come work for me?\" The idea of fighting under those who had killed their friends mere hours ago churned the men's stomach... Until they saw many of their presumably lost comrades smiling from the enemy ranks, eagerly training their guns onto the camp along with all the rest of the UMHK goons. As the wages on offer kept going up and up, the fortune these men had left their homes to seek suddenly seemed achievable. Finally, Duck himself walked out to clasp the officer's hand.\n\nMajor Hoare smiled. Another successful contract for UMHK, and another competitor knocked out of the business. Duck and his men would make fine additions to his company after the losses he took in his last op against BCK."

 COG_mercs.8.desc:0 "As the convoy sped down the road, a Panzerfaust roared past one of the vehicles. A near miss, but a clear signal to Pat Smith to order his mostly native men to open fire. The thump-thump-thump of grenade launchers joined the ear-piercing rattles of MG 42's as the convoy picked up speed. Rather than stand and fight, Pat's thought not of glory, but of the client; getting the diamonds out of the killzone was his highest priority. That ceased to be an option, however, when the ambushers blew their charges and the trees nearest to the road came tumbling down.\n\nThis was a dramatic and unusual escalation. These kinds of mercenary raids were often quick and decisive, a gentlemanly sort of affair. In a world where you never knew who tomorrow's business partner would be, the goal was to complete the contract, not to wipe out the other side. But Major Hoare and his all-white Kommando wanted to send a message to Denard and the rest of his cronies at Forminère: don't send a native to do a white man's job.\n\nIn Smith, however, Hoare had found a worthy match. He had trained his natives well, and even as their casualties mounted in the crossfire, they held firm. Smith knew that Hoare couldn't spare as many losses as he could, for white replacements were so much harder to come by. Finally, after almost a two hour firefight, Hoare's men silently crept back into the jungle, dragging their wounded with them. Smith stood from behind the smoldering Kubel where he'd taken cover. His unit was down to half its normal effectives-much higher casualties than typical in these engagements-and several of the vehicles were inoperable. But the cargo was safe, at least until Hoare had regrouped. Smith knew he had to hurry. He wiped his brow and barked orders to his men to clear the roadblock ahead and load the diamonds into the remaining trucks. As he did so, the cynical adage so familiar to mercenaries sprang into his ears:"

A chokingly humid morning in the Congo, the sun beating down. Soldiers laid on beds of straw as mosquitoes swarmed them. A few jerked left and right in their heat-induced stupor. A tattered flag sat on a wooden pole. Someone barked out orders, to no avail.\n\nThe camp Denard visited that day was nothing of the like: it was better described as a town in the forest. Women came and went, carrying pots on their heads full of herbs, water, and a brownish liquid with the sickly smell of banana beer. Men with rifles slung on their back practically skipped around. Lead through the hustle and bustle of a saturday morning in the Congo, Denard saw the familiar face of his aquantaince, Gotefroid Munongo. The two exchanged pleasantries, and Denard introduced his reason of being.\n\n\"Gotefroid, you must understand, there is some concern about the recent rumblings of the union. Is there any chance you could - pull some strings?\"\n\nTo his surprise, Gotefroid did not pause for even a moment. \"Anything for my good friend, Colonel. Now, have you ever tried the famous banana beer of our camp?\"\n\n\"Well, I have not, but we should really-\" Gotefroid butted in. \"You really must have some!\" Turning to his left, he yelled out for some beer.\n\nDenard failed to remember much after the first sip, and when he sat down to right a formal report he was shocked to find out exactly how much he could not recall. It seems acquaintances come in handy.\n\n\"Minister Steiner,\n\nYou will be pleased to hear I have achieved the objective.

Mobotu seemed destined to rise as high as his race would permit him until he unexpectedly vanished into the jungle along with his entire unit and a vast quantity of arms and ammunition. Shortly after, he changed his name and developed a different reputation -- of one of the most ruthless and capable insurgent warlords in the region.\n\nWhile many of the rebels proclaim allegiance to Bolshevism, Democracy, or one of the many pithy ethnic groups perpetually squabbling for prominence, Mombotu appears to fight only for himself. His fighters are famed for greed and steal whatever they can find from German colonists and African natives alike.\n\nMany of our best men have been hunting Mobutu for months. That he has been spotted at last suggests that the ground might finally be shrinking beneath his feet. We can only hope that this dire threat to our interests will finally be eliminated."

But it's really about his experience with the Panzer divisions during Barbarossa and with the Afrika Korps down there.\"\n\nThe other staffer was shocked, like his co-worker had just admitted to being a member of Antifa. \"You liked it?\" he asked. \"When he just snipes at the German Army for what happened in West Russia? He wasn't there, he should at least have the decency to keep his mouth shut, let alone criticize the ones who fought and died there!\"\n\nThe first staffer was taken aback by the sudden hostility from the fellow staffer. \"I'm not defending his opinions, in fact, I think he could have been a bit more mindful with his words. But he is a general who is held in high esteem by a bunch of people. He did win the Knight's Cross, so he's well entitled to his opinion.\"\n\n\"My thoughts exactly,\" said a third voice. The young staffers were shocked when they saw who it was.\n\nFormer Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel stepped between the staffers and began to pour himself a cup of coffee from the coffeemaker. \"I was with von Thoma from September of 1942 until the end of the war. During his time under my command, I never knew him to be anything but a dutiful and effective commander.\" Setting the pot back in the machine, he looked at the staffers and said \"If he has an opinion on the greatest disaster in German military history since 1918, then I believe his advice must be taken into account.\"\n\nRommel took a sip and walked away.

They came from all over the Reich, stacking their hulls with Zentralafrika's raw bounty for the Pakt's insatiable factories and people. There were other vessels too, he noticed. Plenty of Italian and Iberian ones. One or two from Japan. Another seemed to hoist Indian flags. And that one...\n\nHe frowned. Schaefer thought he remembered the ship from somewhere. One stack, one superstructure. Two masts forward, one aft. But it couldn't be that type, that was an American one! Just to make sure, he took out his binoculars and took a look. No flag on the stern, and the name...\n\nA chill went up his spine as he remembered where he had last seen the ship. The same signs, even. He was younger back then, a couple pay grades lower. It wasn't in the Southern Atlantic through a pair of binoculars, it was in the middle of the North Atlantic through a periscope. He only had a moment to focus on it before the captain ordered a crash dive to save the Boot from a salvo of depth charges. Now, he had time to focus on it as long as he needed.\n\nHis first thought was to call it in, but then he quashed the breath in his throat. Schafer heard rumors that Americans were coming in with the Reichskommissar's permission. Blowing his whistle now might end his career. And as he thought about it, why should he go after the vessel? It was here to do business like everyone else -- no more, no less. America and Germany were at peace now. Perhaps this vessel's mission would bring the two nations a bit closer together.

And when he was fourteen, he asked why he'd have to work in the mines for several hours a day while the engineers sat in an air-conditioned office for half that time.\n\nAnd the answer was always the same; by the circumstances of his birth, Mwenze was inferior.\n\nIt never sat well with Mwenze, but he eventually accepted it. Some things he couldn't change, he thought. The master race they said will rule the world now ruled over him and his. He was stuck doing their bidding, with no say in the matter -- but that was just how it was. An Aryan was good for ruling the world; a native like him was good only for lifting a hundredweight of dirt.\n\nMwenze thought the army would be more of the same: black grunts doing hard, dirty work while white officers sat under their pavilions miles away. But the longer he served, the more the world had changed his mind. Time in the army gave him French mercenaries dragging a truck along the mud like any native, and them asking for his help. Time in the army gave him natives like he charging towards a hail of bullets while their white SS comrades cowered in a ditch -- so much for the \"fearless master race\". And time in the army gave him and his native men victories against the white Americans and South Africans. Far from giving him more of the same, the army instead gave Mwenze strength and pride.\n\nMaybe the white man was wrong, Mwenze thought. The army showed him natives can be just as talented and accomplished as whites, perhaps moreso. They can be mechanics, tank drivers, perhaps even pilots. And they can lead from the fore as well. Perhaps, after the war, Mwenze would flaunt his newfound pride. And he had the skills and weaponry to back up everything he said..."

Relentless, loyal, capable, alive, it is these traits that place Pétillon leagues above many of our alternatives, and he seems to be more than willing to do so. While this is technically nothing more than another overseas proxy conflict, in theory, this represents much more than simply another war won. This represents the Einheitspakt's second entrance to the dark continent. If nothing else represents our return to the world stage, this is certainly it. Perhaps, this is far from the end of our empire within Afrika."

To begin, allow me to restate what a pleasure it is to be speaking with someone who holds the infinite wisdom which Hitler once possessed, though in a new, rejuvenated form! Of course, we must first speak of what exactly is expected of this new Reichskommissariat, whatever its name may wind up being. All that I need to know is what is expected of myself, and my colony, which I am eternally grateful to preside over. To begin, I would like to establish the conditions of the colony at present:\n\n1. The colony continues to sustain an ongoing guerilla conflict from the native population. Largely focused around the north, the continued resistance is presumed to be the direct result of outside PALF forces interfering in the region. Given time, we will ensure that these insurgents are identified and dealt with accordingly.\n\n2. Much of the preexisting infrastructure, including vital road lines, rail lines, and electrical sources have undergone extreme damage. This will obviously take plenty of time to properly alleviate, and will likely consume much of the profits of the colony for the foreseeable future, as well as necessitating aid from the mainland government.\n\n3. The administrative situation at present is extremely unenviable, and is in need of immediate rectification. Few know of the exact status of many imperative systems, and those that do are too busy with maintaining the systems to record their statuses.\n\nOf course, there is a necessity in resolving these issues immediately, and I humbly request sufficient aid to handle these issues as necessary.\n\nYours truly, Reichskommissar Von Hassel."

It hadn't always been like this, the mountain air brushing through his hair as he looked out upon the view which he had worked so hard to procure, a certain pride welling up from within. The middle aged man had not always been a farmer either, nor had he always wanted to be, there had been a time where he was a soldier, a veteran one at that, and his past had not entirely faded into the background of his now more peaceful present.\n\nEvery week or so a boy from the local village would climb the mountain, lugging with him baskets of paper detailing the events of the time, whether they be local fishing contests, or the diplomatic movements of empire's abroad. And every time he came, Goro asked him the same thing, a single paper, the Japanese Military Digest, and every time the boy delivered. He had made sure to pay him well, rewarding the courier for such a find, and seeing fit that he could afford to buy something on the treacherous road back home.\n\nRoutine, it was important to a soldier and a farmer, and for that reason it fit the veteran well, his common daily tasks weaving a web of pertinent must-do's that would guide him with purpose in his day to day living. Today, however, his routine was knocked off kilter as he unfurled the black and white paper between his hands, legs curled over one another upon his bench as he began to adjust his eyes to today's writings. He had often tried to forget what he had done for the Empire, what he had done for Japan, as it never really brought him the same pride that his life now did, and he feared it never would.\n\nHis joy dimmed as he perused the articles, a certain boisterous headline catching his eye, an ache forming just above his brow as it did so. In bold lettering it read, \"The Congo Secured, Mobutu Ascendant!\"\n\nFor a moment he paused, breath ceasing as he pondered the end of their fight upon the frontier of anti-imperialist struggle, words not forming in his head to describe the feeling he now could sense in him. He had served, with distinction, to support this man for the Empire, and now it had been worth it.

It was not an easy task, but the President was now optimistic that they would see more success than they had originally hoped for. It was especially good because it meant that America's path - along with the wider OFN - to Africa was not shut.\n\nWith a friendly government, they could now reestablish the American and OFN presence and authority in Africa.

The collapse of the Reichskommissariat Zentralafrika brought some glimmers of hope for the future of the region, but now these glimmers have come to nothing as the Congo collapses into the chaos of a civil war being fought on a continental scale, and with equally titanic stakes for the superpowers seeking to stake their own claims to the heart of Africa.\n\nThe Congolese Republic is our ally in the region, a government committed to bringing the light of republican government and democracy to the ravaged lands of the Congo, and therefore we have elected to agree to their request to throw our support behind their struggle to reunite the Congo under their flag. Supplies of armaments and other material will soon be underway and we are already examining our options for troop deployments in the region.\n\nThe war to defend democracy in South Africa was not a popular one and we have no reason to believe that sending our men and armaments into the Congo will be any more warmly received by Congress or the public, but for the sake of preserving African democracy - to say nothing of our own interests in the bounty of the Congo - we have no choice but to go down this road once again."

Typically, this struggle has ended in disaster for all involved, with the Congo region collapsing into a chaotic civil war of vast size and complexity which only increases the suffering of the African people thanks to the ineptitude of the colonialists - and, incidentally, destroys the productive uses to which the vast natural bounties of the Congo might be committed.\n\nThis has never been a territory of Japanese influence, but it is past time that the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere shed its exclusive commitment to Asians, and reached out to the distant lands of Africa and the shores of the Atlantic which the Pakt and the OFN guard so jealously. President Mobutu of Azandeland has indicated his willingness to cooperate with the Sphere, as well as a willingness to indulge Japanese interests in the Congo once his victory is secured, and we have been able to reach an arrangement with the Republic of Orungu whereby they will turn a blind eye to the convoys of support in return for supplies, trade agreements, and a promise that we will ensure their neutrality in the conflict, a deal we are more than happy to make.\n\nThe time has come for the Sphere to show its strength on a global scale, and to bring the oppressed peoples of Africa into the warm embrace of the Co-Prosperity Sphere."

Instinctive. A job now, that was all it was to him. A mindless process, going through the motions. An automaton, commanding other automatons.\n\nHe thought for a moment, trying to pinpoint where everything had just...faded. The end of World War II? His return now to this purgatory known as Africa? Nations turned into battlegrounds for superpowers to snipe at each other? He didn't know. All he knew was that the more years passed, the more difficult it was to muster patriotism for a country; a system where he and soldiers were pieces on the geopolitical chessboard. Pawns sent to a meat grinder at the behest of the men in Washington.\n\nSoldiers came from all sides, fighting for pieces of land they didn't care about, for people they didn't know, at the orders of politicians they'd never met.

Trained animals, sent to fight and die to gain the slightest bit of leverage to the politicians.\n\nA noise of revelry distracted him, as he saw a small convoy of soldiers returning.

He remembered those days, when he could celebrate the victories in the SAF, before he realized how little they meant.

Peter resisted a grimace. Home, now that was an interesting concept. \"No. There is no home there for me,\" he finally said, pausing briefly, before deciding to finish. \"Once we're done?
