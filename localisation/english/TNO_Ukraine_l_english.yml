 POLITICS_ERICH_KOCH_DESC:0 "This is what Erich Koch has been left with. This is what he deserves.\n\nAt his peak of authority, Erich Koch was a thug upon a throne, brutal even by the standards of the Third Reich. His colonial policy was an endless cycle of exploitation and repression, designed to beat the Ukrainian people into submission. Under his watch, the Hunger Plan left the native population starving in fields of amber, and his quotas reduced them to slavery. In his mind, he had forged the very picture of Lebensraum: a blood diamond in Hitler's crown.\n\nIt could not last, of course. In the wake of the West Russian War, the Reichskommissariat was left with far more problems than Koch could comprehend. Above him, an army of administrators demanded more and more, hoping to prop up the Reich's ailing economy with further blood from its breadbasket. Below him, a crowd of natives screamed, demanding freedom from the abyss he had created. For the first time, Erich Koch was faced with problems which could not be solved with whips and hammers. The Reichskommissar was finally lost.\n\nRather than attempting major changes, the Reichskommissar has let the colony stagnate beneath him, even as terror rises and profits slow. Deep down, Erich Koch may be aware of some solution, but the man lacks the energy to change Ukraine's fate. In the name of profit, the Reichskommissar ground his colony into sand - now, he watches it blow away."

 POLITICS_VOLODYMYR_KUBIYOVYCH_DESC:0 "An age of oppression, barbarism, and bloodshed has crushed the will of many men and women to take a stand against foreign imperialism, and even fewer ordinary people would dare openly call for independence. However, Volodymyr Kubiyovych is not most people, as a lifetime as a soldier, a geographer, and a politician has shown. However, the many lifestyles of and bureaucracy surrounding Kubiyovych will not stand in the way of the one, true goal which has always persisted in the mind of the Polish-raised Ukranian, with the image of cheering Ukranians in a free state of their own.\n\nA life of study and teaching would not prepare the intellectual for the Nazi invasion of the Polish land he had lived in for most of his life, spurned by diaspora and, now, another invader of his home. Thus, Kubiyovych delved into the fire of his scorn to establish one of the few social programs on the face of Europe, helping thousands of Ukranian men, women, and children affected by the war. Meanwhile, the former cartographer chose to stand against the infamous Hans Frank in his desired slaughter of Ukranian peasants, allowing just a bit more success for his homeless people. However, as the Nazi victory came, all Kubiyovych could do was encourage the growth of the Galician Waffen-SS to use as a foundation for a pseudo-army to protect against further Nazi persecution.\n\nHowever, in the age of darkness Ukraine has found itself in, a light dawns on the horizon for Kubiyovych and his companions. Men may stand against him, clawing at him to strike down his attempts for independence. But such botherations and sins against the Ukranian people shall not stand against Kubiyovych's work with the Reich. Nothing will."
 
 POLITICS_PIETER_SCHELTE_HEEREMA_DESC:0 "Every decent family knows that you keep an extra bottle of your wine for when the situation absolutely demands it. For the German authority in Ukraine, Pieter Schelte Heerema is that extra bottle.\n\nA Dutchman from Amsterdam, Heerema was quick to collaborate with the Germans, joining the Waffen-SS in 1940. During his tenure, he helped establish and lead the Nederlandsche Oost Compagnie, which organized the Dutch settlement of the Reich's eastner territories during the war. It is through this channel that Heerema found himself in RK Ukraine by the war's end, helping in the administrative efforts of the colony.\n\nAfter the failure of the West Russian War, and the attempted SS coup in Germania, Heerema began to distance himself more and more from Himmler and the organization, while still officially retaining his SS title. Through his colonial and SS connections, he was able to ascend the ladder of the RK, all while managing to profit off of the 'rightful Germanization of the land'.\n\nNow that Ukraine, along with the rest of the Reich really, has gone into disrepair, the Reichstag has found a suitable safety candidate in Heerema. If he cannot improve conditions in the RK, he can at least keep them steady."

 POLITICS_GEORG_LEIBBRANDT_DESC:0 "In his years as deputy, Georg Leibbrandt had always dreamed of a moment like this. To see Koch killed by his own hubris, to see every folly of the old regime laid bare, the concept of such a dramatic collapse had come as a spiteful fantasy to the deputy. Yet his dreams always ended with his domain as stable and functional, a product of his scientific reforms. They never ended like this.\n\nShoved into the twisted throne of Erich Koch, Leibbrandt never realized the level of mismanagement at every level of the Reichskommissariat. Yes, the deputy had seen the Ukrainians as natural allies, but the scale of their insubordination outmatched even his most dire scenarios. Where he imagined himself the sole reformer of Koch's broken system, he now must share power with two fellow "visionaries", who shoot down every one of his proposals. Even now, he hears talks in the halls of the hopped-up deputy who will be swept away as soon as the war is over. Insubordination, it seems, has outlasted even the Reichskommissariat itself.\n\nThere is no time for reform. There is no place for change. As Leibbrandt looks around his dying colony, he can only think one thought, twenty-three years. More than two decades of badly formulated plans, ill-conceived rhetoric, and petty infighting have left Ukraine in this moment. Woe to the man who is left to pick up the pieces."

 UKR_paradise_undone:0 "Paradise Undone"
 UKR_paradise_undone_desc:0 "Ukraine was promised to be a paradise for the Aryan people. A lush land where one would not need lift a finger to reap great wealth, and where the future of Germany could be built in the sun by her sons, free from degeneracy and subhumanity. Life as it was meant to be.\n\nOf course, this was before millions were starved to death under the Hunger Plan, major cities were emptied of their population and made into "strongholds", and massive insurgencies have made governing in some areas nearly impossible. Ukraine is a hollow and bleeding shell, just waiting to be put out of its misery."
 UKR_breadbasket_of_the_reich:0 "The Breadbasket of the Reich"
 UKR_breadbasket_of_the_reich_desc:0 "Since the Reich's great triumph in the east, Ukraine has been the breadbasket of the Reich and its allies in the Pakt. A great deal of the administration's budget comes from its massive amounts of agricultural exports. While this has allowed Ukraine to remain somewhat economically self-sufficient, the trade has hampered our industrial development in other sectors.\n\nUkraine is hopelessly dependent on its agricultural exports. With so little diversification in other economic sectors, a crash in the agricultural market could spell doom for the Reichskommissariat's economy."
 UKR_land_of_contrasts:0 "Land of Contrasts"
 UKR_land_of_contrasts_desc:0 "Reichskommissariat Ukraine is bitterly divided into spheres of influence by the powerful, and the powerless cling to them desperately. From Leibbrandt's academic and collaborator allies to Ohlendorf's SS, from Heerema's NOC to Hans-Otto Bräutigam's small but growing reformist clique, nobody in Reichskommissariat Ukraine is truly comfortable with what they have. Even the Reichskommissar, Erich Koch, is unsatisfied with his position.\n\nWith these growing cracks the Reichskommissariat's administration is inefficient and corrupt. Unless decisive action is taken soon, the Reichskommissariat may be in danger of outright collapse. With Erich Koch's refusal to take any meaningful action and firm refusal to reform in even minor, cosmetic ways, such a collapse seems likely."

 UKR_breadbasket_of_the_reich_raga:0 "The Breadbasket of the Reich"
 UKR_breadbasket_of_the_reich_raga_desc:0 "Since the Reich's great triumph in the east, Ukraine has been the breadbasket of the Reich and its allies in the Pakt. A great deal of the administration's budget comes from its massive amounts of agricultural exports. While this has allowed Ukraine to remain somewhat economically self-sufficient, the trade has hampered our industrial development in other sectors.\n\nUnder the new Reich Administration, however, the Raga was reinstated, giving the Ukrainians considerably more lee-way to manage their matters. While somewhat less effective that other more authoritarian options, this will surely guide matters in a more §Gpacified matter.§!"

 UKR_not_their_war:0 "Not Their War"
 UKR_not_their_war_desc:0 "For nearly two decades following the Reich's triumph in the East, the Wehrmacht has not engaged in mass anti-partisan operations. Such things, except in the most dire circumstances, were left in the hands of the police. Following Hitler's death and the collapse of stability across the East, the police were woefully inadequate against large insurgent forces and popular uprisings. As the colony burns around them, the Wehrmacht in Ukraine must rapidly adapt to fight a war they haven't fought in decades - an anti-partisan war."
