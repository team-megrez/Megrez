 UKR_the_new_hruchevsky_desc: "아주 짧은 시간동안 우크라이나는 자유롭게 숨쉴 수 있었습니다. 우리 목을 짓누르는 폭군도, 피를 흘리게 하던 볼셰비키와 파시스트도 없었던 아주 짧은 평화의 시간이 있었습니다. 이 평화, 우리 존재의 영원한 정당이자 우크라이나의 꿈을 품은 이 기념비적인 사건은 국가혁명의 서사시에서 볼 수 있는 한 위대한 영웅의 손에 의해 만들어진 것입니다. 미하일로 흐루세우스키는 당시 우크라이나 역사를 연구해 온 몇 안 되는 역사가였습니다. 1917년 중앙 라다 의장으로 선출된 이후 그의 꿈은 번번이 좌절되어야만 했습니다. 1930년대 이르러 우크라이나 자치의 유일한 불꽃은 폴란드 힐라시나에 UNDO라는 군소정당으로만 남아 있었습니다.\n\n볼셰비키가 폴란드를 침공하고 모든 것을 없애버렸을 때, 소련은 현지 협력자로 UNDO를 포함한 민족주의자를 활용했습니다. 독일군이 국경을 넘자 UNDO는 이 상황을 이용해 성장했습니다. 그 이후로 우리는 우크라이나를 점령해 오는 모든 침략자들과 포기하지 않은 채 싸워왔습니다. 잔혹한 독일인, 미친 반데라주의자, 저주받은 공산주의자들은 우리가 계속 싸울 힘이 없다고 착각하는 것 같은데, 그건 착각입니다. 아주 크나큰 착각이지요."
 UKR_the_old_guard_of_the_republic_desc: "While many of our men continue to fight for Ukrainian democracy, there are very few which continue to shine as brightly as the old guard of the Republic.\n\nTaras Bulba-Borovets, a partisan at heart, Oleksandr Udovychenko, a general who bore the burden of exile, and Yuriy Tyutunnyk, a man who had once supported the Soviets. Their histories are filled with hardship and struggle, yet they were all in service to the Republic and our homeland. Each of these three men may be old, though they remain eager and willing to fight for the survival and liberation of our democracy and people. They will assist us to the best of their ability, and once the time comes, they will be instrumental in the destruction of the fascist tyrants."
 UKR_borovets_commissars_desc: "Since the UNDO effectively couped the U-SSR military government in Galicia, and even further beyond in the last days of the Bolshevik invasion, Taras Bulba-Borovets has fought for Democracy with his armies of supporters for decades on end. While constantly harassed by disorder within his ranks and arrests from German forces, Borovets has stood firmly for our cause. Currently occupied in maintaining the Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army within the Generalgouvernement's borders, the living legend has found himself wanting for manpower.\n\nWith a recent wave of volunteers now waiting in the wings, we have the option to send them towards Borovets for training under his faithful \"100 Man Army\" of commissars, so named after those faithful few who have stuck with Borovets for so long. Given these reinforcements, it won't be long before these skilled men and women find themselves a part of those legendary 100."
 UKR_heirs_of_the_exiles_desc: "Exile is something many Ukrainians know of intimately. When the Bolsheviks came first, those who resisted were forced to leave their homes and become emigres, exiles in a foreign land, surviving until their time to return comes. And while they settled into their new homes, and went about their new lives, none have ever forgotten about their homeland. While most remain in their homes, watching from afar as our land is butchered, some return to their ancestral home, Side-by-side, they stand in solidarity with us, marching with us, fighting with us, bleeding with us. They give the Republic the legitimacy of the true government of Ukraine that it so desperately needs, and they give us something which the people need in these trying times - hope."
 UKR_the_culturalists_might_desc: "For all their heinous crimes, the greatest tragedy of Ukraine's occupation was the suppression and persecution of Ukrainian culture. Ivan Dziuba and the Culturalists treat this as the existential threat that it is, connecting root nationalism to that very shared culture, and advocating at every turn for resources to be spent on its spread.\n\nGrowing in influence, they have a simple yet very powerful message, and work to build grassroots support among the people. Though of course operating in a decentralized manner, they have proven extremely effective in organizing the militias that will be needed in the fights to come."
 UKR_the_slave_book_clubs_desc: "A nation's culture is its soul, the Nazis know this well. In their attempts to stomp out our nation under their iron heel, they have sought to deny their slaves access to their culture, their very souls, their identity as Ukrainians, and as human beings. We reject their tyranny.\n\nWe will infiltrate the slave camps and slums across Ukraine, spreading food, protection, compassion, and books. Books are the key to culture, to civilization itself. To deny a man literacy is to lock off a part of his mind and doom him to ignorance. So, we will help educate the slaves of the Reich, so that one day, when they are free, they can express themselves and take pride in who they are."
 UKR_galician_roots_of_the_ukrainian_tree_desc: "Our main base of support lies in Galicia. While the Ukrainians there receive better treatment than the Poles, they know that it is a farce to pit them against their brothers in bondage. Enslavement is still enslavement, and freedom is still freedom, no matter what the slavers say. We are glad our people see this.\n\nNot only that, but our roots also lie here - it was Galicia where the UNDO was born, proud defenders of Ukrainian rights under Polish rule and the Soviet occupation. When we proclaim Ukraine's liberation from fascist tyranny, a beautiful tree will sprout, and it's roots will be in Galicia, the birthplace of a new Ukrainian democracy, its fruits being granted to all under its shade."
 UKR_eternal_monuments_to_unity_desc: "The discord that should otherwise exist between the many men - now co-operating in pursuit of a shared goal - has astonishingly failed to manifest, and working together they have managed to make incredible progress in their goals. Though certainly amazing in its own right, this unexpected unity also offers tremendous opportunity to demonstrate national cohesion.\n\nThis opportunity cannot be missed, and so a campaign of 'information' will be launched. The bravery and camaraderie existing between these men will be showcased, and in so doing the same principles can be attributed to the state."
 UKR_our_men_on_the_inside_desc: "There are many brave souls in Ukraine who have accepted the ire of their countrymen in order to 'collaborate' with the occupation - and thereby infiltrate it. Among these stand Ohloblyn, formerly the mayor of Kiew and now serving as the mayor of Brest following a forced relocation by Koch. Though saddled with Bahaziy, the fascist, as his deputy both then and now, he has been able to keep the man in check and thereby maintain his position.\n\nA most useful position. Information, supply, and weaponry can be and is redirected to liberating forces, moving the state ever closer to freedom. A new shipment of both is immediately forthcoming."
 UKR_ohloblyns_place_in_brest_desc: "Ohloblyn may have been exiled, demeaned, and forgotten, but that doesn't mean he's powerless. Under his watch is a small collection of minor anti-partisan and police brigades, all of which are at least willing to work with us. Some of these men are strident democrats, simply trying to protect their people from any further damage. Others are Melnykite fascists simply tired of Reich mismanagement. Whatever their motives, we can use them. While not enough for a full division, their manpower will prove valuable in our fight against the Nazi menace."
 UKR_a_bureaucratic_reshuffle_desc: "Fortunately for us, there is a healthy variety of capable, suitably sympathetic bureaucrats who may be inclined to lend their talents to our cause. Less fortunately is the fact that most of them languish in useless positions in which their abilities are all but wasted on menial tasks that accomplish little. Meanwhile, Melnyk's collaborators have stacked the bench in Brest-Litovsk, and if we are to gain a foothold there, we will need to find a creative solution to this little roadblock.\n\nOleksandr Ohloblyn has presented such a solution. He shall begin the process of a \"bureaucratic reshuffle\" in Brest-Litovsk and ensure that bureaucrats loyal to us take all of the top spots, while making sure Melnyk's men find themselves in the useless offices that our allies once held. Bahaziy's lot won't be too pleased with this maneuver, but we have not come this far without already stepping on a few toes."
 UKR_promote_popular_participation_desc: "Participation in our struggle against tyranny is broad-reaching, yet some struggle to understand what it truly is.\n\nWhat is democracy, if not the participation of the common people in governance of the nation, in resistance to fascism, in solidarity with our country folk? To liberate ourselves, we, the common masses of free peoples must work together for something greater, an idea with merit, for ourselves and the Republic. Yet we also fight for the liberation of not just ourselves, but of our friends, family, even complete strangers. Should we shirk in our duties, should we miss even one Ukrainian, all this would not be worth it. The people must know that without their help, they and the ones next to them cannot, in any sense of the word, be free."
 UKR_prying_open_the_pipeline_desc: "For those in the Reichskommissariat Moskowien, buying guns is a surprisingly easy affair. A steady stream of illicit weapons pour out of Germany daily, to be siphoned by their various factions and used to conduct their endless war. Until now, the PG has supported itself through less reliable methods of raiding and desertion, but that can change. With our connections through Ohloblyn, we may be able to divert this pipeline for our own ends. Each German gun will leave us more prepared for this upcoming war - in time, perhaps more than the Germans themselves."
 UKR_recontest_galicia_desc: "At the westernmost extreme of Ukraine lies Galicia, a region stuck in a rather... complicated situation. Currently, it lies under the jurisdiction of the Generalgouvernement, separated from Germany's administration in Ukraine. Despite this, much of our popular support comes from this region regardless of the arbitrary lines the Germans have deigned to draw across Eastern Europe.\n\nUnfortunately, our mortal enemies, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, also have considerable sway over the people of Galicia. We cannot allow them to gain a monopoly over one of the few regions we can call our own. Coordinating efforts to combat their influence will be rather difficult in such a distant area, but the alternative may cost us our only reliable base of support."
 UKR_saturday_night_mass_desc: "Over the course of the administrative reorganization following the West Russian War, the effects of which landed our close allies Ohloblyn and Bahaziy into leadership of Brest, have also sent us a treasure trove of \"untrustworthy\" regional governors in the region surrounding us. Whether these are low-level bureaucrats, well-meaning collaborators, or just plain-old power-hungry pawns, we can begin taking action on those who we have found liable to be amenable to our cause.\n\nThrough singling out those who will likely work with us and persuading them to aid us -or more likely, only making them aware of our existence- we will find ourselves with a great many new recruits, and many more connections once the opportunity to rise presents itself. All we need to do is hold meetings with the likely supporters, and we hold ourselves access to a fantastic potential meeting place or two."
 UKR_the_banderite_files_desc: "Defeating the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in Galicia will be no small task. These vengeful Banderites are fanatics, and have been known to fight with an almost animalistic ferocity. That being said, radical ideals are no substitute for proper tactics, and with the help of a little creative thinking, supplanting them as the dominant partisan group in the region may indeed be possible.\n\nOur initial strategy shall be to remain a step ahead of the Banderites at all times. Partisan units shall observe their patrols, examine the effect of their ambushes, and study which avenues of attack they are most comfortable with. Once we have this knowledge in our arsenal, we shall use it against them and root out the UPA once and for all."
 UKR_rally_the_turncoat_coppers_desc: "The Germans have long understood that holding the lands of the East with the Wehrmacht alone is an impossible task. Here in Ukraine, many of the local policing duties have fallen into the hands of native police units who collaborate with the occupiers in order to free up their soldiers for more pressing fronts. The Germans may intend to turn us against one another, but this may prove to be their undoing.\n\nTo seize Brest-Litovsk, we need only reach out to the police departments there and sway them to see things from our point of view. As far as we know, the tendrils of the UPA have not managed to penetrate into the local law enforcement, and it would be unwise to sit around and wait for them to seize this chance before we do. Should all go to plan, we will gain a very useful ally indeed when the uprising begins in earnest."
 UKR_pull_some_strings_desc: "Ohloblyn has connections and influence within the Brest region, and some of our men do not realize that our goals reach farther than their imagination. Their suggestions involve Ohloblyn utilizing such influence to pull the policemen of the Brest region to our side here and now, yet we asked them one question. Why not equip them first?\n\nThe Reichskommissariat is desperate to stamp out resistance, blinded by their urge to crush us once and for all. So desperate, in fact, that Ohloblyn and his friends could send a request for additional equipment to be sent to the Brest region in order to bring about a more swift end to resistance there. Using such emotions to our advantage is what may yet give us the edge in the coming fight."
 UKR_build_up_the_polissian_sich_desc: "The Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army have been driven deep into the Galician mountains. Despite this, they are still a formidable force, possessing hardened fighters, deep ties into their region, and a willingness to fight and die surpassed perhaps only by our own.\n\nIt is therefore time to ensure that our alliance is formalized, politically if not quite yet militarily, and so cement future relations. The Polissian Sich is valuable indeed, and we will benefit from such cooperation in the future."
 UKR_organize_the_mobs_desc: "The inevitable grows closer and closer. The instability gripping the occupation state and its loathsome administrators grows stronger and stronger, and more and more people are emboldened to take a stand against it. Yet the puppets still have strength, and in time they will crush the bodies, if not the spirit, of these brave souls. Unless we take action.\n\nWe will. We will organize, arm, and task them with purpose, and in so doing turn them from a mob into an army. They stand a chance, if they stand with us. The invaders have none."
 UKR_call_the_collaborators_desc: "In an ideal world, we would renounce any man who worked to maintain the German hold on our land. However, we do not live in an ideal world.\n\nAdministrators, bureaucrats, soldiers, we need them all. Our manpower reserves can drastically be improved with the addition of these Ukrainian collaborators, and their knowledge would do wonders fueling our new beast. With every taker, we gain information, intelligence, and caches of precious weaponry. Past the moral conundrum, using this vast bank of resources is a no brainer.\n\nThe news shall be spread. Posters, pamphlets, word of mouth. Join the Republic, no matter your crimes Waffen-SS, the National Army, or the Auxiliary Police, the past makes no more difference. If you wish to fight for our Ukrainian Republic, we welcome you!"
 UKR_a_deal_with_the_reds_desc: "It is impossible to downplay the size of the upcoming struggle we must surmount for a free Ukraine; savage Banderites, the Reichs armies, and zealous Bolsheviks all stand in opposition to the establishment of democracy in our homeland. We cannot afford to face all three of our enemies at once, and we may not have to. As much as we may loathe the Reds for decades of socialist dictatorship, we share a mutual hatred of the fascists that far outweigh our animosity for each other.\n\nWe'll use our contacts to send a message to the communists asking for a ceasefire, maybe even an agreement of cooperation, to destroy the vile forces of the UPA and the Nazis. It won't last, of course, but one less enemy to deal with in the early phases will give us time to build up and annihilate them later."
 UKR_chase_the_communists_out_desc: "Many in our ranks were not even born when Ukraine was last under Soviet occupation. They never experienced the horrors and persecution that Communist rule entailed - while this was never as severe as it is now under a fascist government - the red's incompetence led directly to the nightmare we now live in.\n\nSome of the more naive among us want to cooperate with the communists as long as the Swastika flies over Ukraine. The communists who so gladly persecuted us when we weren't necessary to their survival? No! We will not work with the communists. Ukraine will be free of all dictators, whether red or brown.\n\nWe'll strike the red strongholds in the west, removing the tumor that would otherwise grow to cripple Ukraine. The fascists and bolsheviks are fundamentally the same at heart, and soon the west will be free of them - and then the rest of Ukraine will follow."
 UKR_prepare_a_provisional_government_desc: "The Nazi abomination is falling apart - their authority in the west of Ukraine has become little more than a formality, with the central occupation force unable to extend their control outside certain urban areas. It is finally time for our partisan movement to prepare to take up the reins of government. A provisional one will be formed to quickly take the place of the Reichskommissariat - a democratic, liberal republic, not communist and not fascistic. Horlis and his loyal men will take the helm and create a proper system that serves the people and will listen to their demands.\n\nThe transition will be difficult - our country has been stripped of much of its resources, and few have had the opportunity to govern themselves. But let this be a step towards prosperity for all Ukrainians - a dream much closer to being realized than it may ever have been."
 UKR_what_of_the_occupiers_desc: "Generalplan Ost, and its cruel implementation over the past two decades, meant that thousands of Germans moved east to settle in our lands, 'cleansing' it of Ukrainians and fertilizing our lands with our blood. Now there are hundreds of thousands of settlers across the country, many glad followers of the Nazi cause. The question of how to deal with them is debated within our movement. Some consider that trying to deport all Germans will create a fifth column against our cause - particularly among those that lived in Ukraine prior to the occupation. Others consider that there is no other adequate course of action. Questions regarding what happens to the children of these settlers who had no choice in the matter have also arisen.\n\nIt will be nearly impossible to make a decision that appeases everyone within the movement. The more collaborator-sympathizing part of our faction wishes to give concessions to the settlers, which will not go down well with our more nationalistic followers, yet a decision must still be made if we are to deal with the issue at hand decisively. Let us avoid falling over the first hurdle to creating a free Ukraine."
 UKR_a_promise_desc: "The leader of the supposedly superior Aryan race lies on his deathbed - as his health falters, his tendrils retreat from Ukraine. Those in the west are ready to fight for their freedom and make the most of the approaching opportunities.\n\nHorlis will prepare a speech to rally supporters of a free and democratic Ukraine. He will promise free and fair elections and that they will be held as soon as possible once Ukraine is liberated from fascist and communist rule. We won't use authoritarian tricks like a 'temporary dictatorship' or the elections being guided. Ukraine must be truly free once it is liberated. It will be!"
 UKR_the_anthem_of_the_liberated_desc: "The clock chimes, and Ukraine will rise. Germany ailes under its own weight, the Reichskommissariat crumbles, and Koch lays on his deathbed. Never since the days of 1917 have we found ourselves with such a firm chance for National Liberation. From what we can tell, with many garrisons currently either dissolving in light of Germany's effective collapse or struggling against many of the other partisan movements taking the initiative, it is clear that the time to rise is now or never.\n\nBulba-Borovets' Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army has already begun the preliminary actions of rising up once the Generalgouvernement falls, and Ohloblyn's government in Brest is mobilizing at this very moment. Before long, Ukraine will be free, and we will play our hand in bringing down the Reichskommissariat.\n\nWhether or not we live to see it."

 UKR_red_harvest_awaits_desc: "For a time, Ukraine knew peace and freedom. The great Communist thinkers of the past -Bukharin, Lenin, Shakhrai- laid the foundation for the future which we so cherished through the 1920's and '30s. The grand cultural revolution fought for by men like Shumskyi, paired with the strength of Communism found in men like Petrovsky would have ensured our utopian civilization would live forever. It was at that very moment that the Nazis stormed our lives, cut away our souls, burned away our people, and enslaved those they did not kill.\n\nEven as we fought to revive the dream in the doomed West Russian War, we were only crushed beneath the heel of the German war machine, yet again. Now, however, the Reich's corruption seems to have caught up with it, and not a moment too soon, as Koch lays dying, and National Socialism lies on the brink. Now, all we can do is all we have ever been able to do; fight."
 UKR_freedom_of_adherence_desc: "For as long as the dream of a Soviet dream has existed, men like Chubar, the loyal Bukharinist, Postyshev, the old-guard statesman, and Kosior, the trusty Secretary, have served Ukraine for as long -and sometimes, longer- as the Revolution has occurred itself. Since then, we have had few as subservient to the state as these men, and Bukharin certainly looks down upon them as some of the best this state has seen. Even then, these are not perfect men.\n\nOnce entrusted with leading the state in the twilight years of the Union, the West Russian War was to be their great redemption, and yet we only fell further by their hand. Antonov-Ovseenko, our Napolean-to-be, was but one of those that failed us. Chubar, Postyshev, and Kosior were among them. They resigned in shame, and their resignations were accepted, and men like Shumskyi rose to prominence. We have no right to forsake our past, however, for if we did, Communism would have been long-lost. Perhaps these men can revive their reputations as saviors, but only in time will we find our efforts to be worth their while."
 UKR_embers_a_broken_dream_desc: "As the Soviet Revolution set Ukraine alight with revolutionary fervor, the Borot'bist party was one of few fighting for the culture of Ukraine and the rights of its people; things the Centralists and orthodox Bukharinists would know nothing about. Since the inception of a Socialist Ukraine, men like Oleksandr Shumskyi, the champion of autonomy, Mykhailo Volobuiev, a dedicated industrialist, and Yurii Lapchynsky, the commanding statesman, were all shunned as \"National-Deviationists\", men whose beliefs were deemed too radical, nationalistic, or downright traitorous to the cause, were allowed to not only stay but be given an increasingly large position in the government as thanks to the policies of Bukharin.\n\nEven now, however far the republic has fallen, the National Communists of Ukraine refuse to give up, refuse to call it quits. Never will Communism in Ukraine falter, and never will Ukraine give up."
 UKR_arm_frontline_militias_desc: "The forces of the Reichskommissariat are vast and well-armed, but for every life they snuff out, two more arise to avenge them. Across our homeland are countless resistance cells that have kept the dream of a liberated Ukraine alive, however scattered and disorganized they may be. No more; it is time that we rally our fellows amongst the downtrodden but unbowed and create a real army.\n\nOnce we have united these valiant partisans and provided them with suitable equipment and training, we will have a fighting force capable of holding the frontline as we advance on Kyiv and beyond.\n\nThe time for hiding is soon at its end soon, comrades! Will §Ryou§! be up to the task?"

 UKR_free_soviet_thought_desc: "The cornerstone of any revolution is the motivation of the revolutionary. That is why instead of focusing on the failures of the past, we must instead focus on inspiring the proletariat to break the chains of Nazi rule. We shall spread Marx's theories and the hopes of a Ukrainian utopia, where all can live side by side, where no person is denied food or shelter, and where the means of production are owned by the workers.\n\nWinning over the general population will be a great boon to the socialist cause. The toiling peasantry and factory workers will hear stories of a great stateless society that awaits them if they join the righteous revolution.\n\nThe suffering people of the East will surely flock to our ranks once they hear of the bright future that awaits them in a Free, Soviet Ukraine."

In order to level the playing field when the revolution begins, we will target and destroy critical infrastructure used by the German administration. If successfully executed, we will effectively shut down all regional transportation. This will trap local German garrisons, and prevent reinforcements from responding quickly."

 UKR_centralist_state_desc: "While the Nazis remain our biggest concern, we would be fools to focus purely on military matters. If we are to free ourselves and begin to move towards communism, we need a state apparatus. Based on centralist ideology, Ukraine will finally have a true independent state.\n\nWe will streamline our government, and centralize our authority. No bureaucratic waste will be allowed, for all efforts must contribute towards our great war of liberation. Oleksander Shumskyi will guide us in this process. In these chaotic times, Shumskyi has emerged as the man to lead the people of Ukraine to our destined future! One of prosperity, and socialism."
 UKR_keeping_together_desc: "The simple truth is that we don't have the industry to supply our soldiers. However, Germany does, and they've been generous enough to keep them stored in arms reach. Stealing guns and holding the warehouses would be a huge boon to our war effort, and could make the difference between a free, or shackled Ukraine.\n\nWe have unparalleled experience in partisan warfare, with many veterans having used guerilla methods for the over 20 years. Using a combination of veterans and rookies, we'll wipe clean these storehouses, simultaneously crippling Germany, and solving our logistics issue."
 UKR_the_longest_war_desc: "For decades, Communist insurgent cells in Eastern Ukraine have been fighting the Nazi occupation. Known to locals as the Long War, this fight has bled the Germans of resources and manpower over time.

Our agitators are spreading the word of resistance against the invaders, the promise of a better life under the immortal banner of National Communism. With the swelling of recruits in our movement, we can do more than just fill our ranks; we can re-introduce our people to the Soviet dream.\n\nLife will still be harsh for these men and women, but life struggling in the woods and underground is still superior to life under the National Socialists, and we'll need all the bodies we can get for the patriotic struggle. The day of reckoning is coming soon, and when it arrives, we will never need to hide again."
 UKR_eyes_finer_points_desc: "Germania doesn't need to know. While sending a message of a quick and zealous revolution may be a temptation, it is not a plausible strategy to win this war. We must be surgical and precise in our approach, as one slip-up, one collaborator running off with a report of unrest would end our glorious revolution before it even began.\n\nWe know this land better than any German could ever hope to. We know our neighbors, we know the paths, trails, and weather. We will sneak past the Reichskommissariat's patrols, where our best commandos can seize key points of communication. We'll convert the populace to our cause, and dispose of any and all German messengers passing through. They can scream, but Germania won't hear."
 UKR_bleed_the_beast_desc: "Our national identity has been a target for destruction, and our Nazi wannabe gods used their entire arsenal of death to stomp us down to dust. A silver lining exists here, though. To kill us, the Nazis needed to bring their might to us.\n\nSoldiers and settlers alike spewed into our lands, bringing up settlements and towns. Bureaucracies, autonomies, commissariats, and whatever else they wish to call their slaughterhouses lay disjointed and scattered, ripe for easy pickings. We can send out expeditions and partisans to break the connection to Germania, we can kidnap collaborators and destroy the pyramid of bureaucracy that upholds the Nazi yoke.\n\nPlanes, tanks, guns, and bombs.

Some will fall in the service of the cause, yes, but those that remain will be more skilled, more committed, and eternally loyal to the cause."

 UKR_national_defense_manual_desc: "A soldier fights only as well as he is trained to, and by that standard we are significantly behind the Reichskommissariat. However brave and devoted our fighters may be, our commanders are keenly aware that to send them into combat in their current state would be nothing but a march to their graves. Improvements in training are clearly needed. Unfortunately, with the escalation of Nazi patrols and crackdowns in recent months, comes a greater need for subtlety until our moment of opportunity inevitably arrives.\n\nOur officers have proposed an interim solution: The National Defense Manual, a handy little textbook to provide our supporters with a basic instruction manual on waging revolutionary warfare: guidelines on treating injuries, firearm usage and maintenance, construction of weapons and equipment, asymmetric warfare strategies, and ambush-based small unit tactics. The propaganda department can shift resources to begin production and distribution immediately. Yes, the Germans are sure to get their hands on it eventually, but any information they find will be knowledge they already know, and it cannot save them from what's coming."
 UKR_arise_comrades_lenin_bukharin_desc: "When the time comes, we must be ready to fight - and that means that fighters themselves must be had. Training is all well and good, of course, but it means nothing if there are no men to train, or if their trainers have been shot for lack of support. We will focus on the necessary first, and focus upon the printing of propaganda to ensure maximum support, rather than instructional manuals.\n\nWhile it will be a challenge to expand regimes to account for the swell in fighters, there should be enough time before the uprising itself. Time enough to ensure that we have what we need."
 UKR_soviet_streetfighters_desc: "The German may be a figure to hate and despise, but one cannot underestimate their ability to crush revolts and uprisings - they have done so many times over the years. To prepare for our own uprising, then, we must force them to dilute their forces, committing to many small engagements. We will encourage this among our more zealous fighters.\n\nRiots in German-majoriuty streets, 'random' bombings, assassinations, anything that causes chaos. Doing so will allow us to move closer before the strike, and enable our seizure of power."
 UKR_assemble_uprisings_desc: "The time is fast approaching. The continuing disintegration of the occupation state is clear to all, and when speaking of revolution the only talk is of when, not if. We must make the final preparations in order to be ready for that time.\n\nThe militias will be called up, assembled, armed, and moved to the prepared attack points. Ordinarily the Germans would intercept and destroy them - but they are far too busy to do so right now. Far too distracted. That is most excellent, indeed."
 UKR_red_storm_gathers_desc: "A specter is haunting Ukraine, the specter of communism. From the Security Council in Kyiv themselves to the lowliest colonial bureaucrat in Kharkiv, the invaders can feel the winds of history blowing against them. One day, a local collaborator village chief is found swinging from a tree, never again to fulfill his quota of slaves to be harvested; the next, an entire battalion of Schuma deserts while marching on an isolated country road, even the most craven deciding they can no longer bear the monstrous tasks ordered of them. Their leaders remain unable to sleep in anxiety, their soldiers hide away in fortresses, no longer having effective control of most rural areas, their treasonous collaborators quake in terror of their coming judgment, and their settlers no longer stray beyond their \"Aryan\" strongholds for fear of the people's righteous anger. Our commanders are prepared for the task ahead, our soldiers are ready and eager to drive the enemy out, and our people are filled with joyous anticipation for their coming liberation.\n\nWe need an opening, a decisive strike at the weak foundations of the Nazi terror state over Ukraine, and we can bring the entire rotten structure crashing down. Fortuitously, that chance may come soon: rumors speak of great unrest within the Reichskommissariat's numerous prisons, sparked by our comrades within. §RIt would be a pity if we didn't join in on the fun.§!"

 UKR_dissent_dark_desc: "The Ukrainian is inherently intolerant of oppression, and yearns for freedom from foreign control of any sort. The Ukrainian is strong and stubborn, and the Vozhd, glorious as he is, understands and shares this valorous trait. He also understands how to emphasize it.\n\nMany prospective heroes of Ukraine have already broken their imposed chains, and fight in their own ways for emancipation. The Vozhd must, can, will rally them, show them the most worthy cause they can dedicate themselves to and, in turn, sow the seeds of general insurrection."
 UKR_rage_ranks_desc: "영도자의 병사들은 소총을 든 농부들에 불과하며, 훈련도 받지 않았고 현대전을 수행할 능력도 없다고 알려져 있습니다. 하지만 이는 이들의 가장 중요한 특징인 분노를 간과한 것입니다. 눈부시고 압도적인 분노에 충성심, 결단력, 애국심이 더해진 이 병사들은 세계 어디에서도 유례를 찾아볼 수 없습니다.\n\n우크라이나와 국민을 위해 자유를 지키기 위해 영도자와 그의 군인들의 절대적인 헌신을 의심하는 사람들에게 이러한 자질을 강조하고, 모범을 보이고, 보여줘야 합니다. 우리는 침묵하지 않을 것입니다. 우리는 소극적이지 않을 것입니다. 우리는 통제되지 않을 것입니다."
 UKR_bloody_fray_desc: "It is finally time. After years of rebuilding, of running, of hiding, we will do so no more. The Vozhd, glorious as he always is and shall remain, has finished his visionary plans for the Third Struggle, and our enemies know not how close they are to destruction.\n\nAll the Vozhd must do is present the plan to his loyal subordinates, so that they may carry it to the front lines - and light the spark that has laid dormant for so long."
 UKR_connections_faithless_desc: "As detestable as he may be, Stetsko is correct in one thing - he does have connections. Traitorous elements - who will be justly served in good time and measure - have greatly weakened our ties both to our brothers and to the people outside of the occupied lands.\n\nWe must rebuild these ties if we are to succeed in the battles ahead, as their support and facilitation will be critical beyond measure. We must therefore listen to Stetsko, and work to follow his suggestions. Sacrifices must be made to achieve the glorious future desired."
 UKR_carnage_righteous_desc: "As our plan finalizes, so too does the conviction of Stetsko and Shukhevych that there remain numerous problems inherent in it. They can continue to 'fix' them if desired, but the Vozhd will no longer be denied - and he will begin the Third Struggle.\n\nThe efforts of the Vozhd will themselves lay the groundwork for ultimate victory and, once achieved, will forever preclude any more 'questioning' of his plans. None will dare challenge him again."
 UKR_charisma_treacherous_desc: "Shukhevych has been a problem from the very start, always speaking his mind - openly, no less - about the inadequacy of our soldiers, arms, and preparations. Insinuating, ever so carefully, that the Vozhd has made errors. He would have been replaced but, unfortunately, his popularity among the officers and his admittedly significant military talent affords him protection.\n\nHe will keep his place - and his head - for now. He will work to solve our problems, and he may speak as he wishes. But all will be recorded. All will be remembered."
 UKR_patriots_poland_desc: "No matter how many guns we have, and how much the common populace may or may not support us, there is one thing we will always require - fighters. They are difficult to find, and even harder to motivate. But some have been found - scattered in and around the Generalgovernment.\n\nThere they - Polissians, Poles, Kubiyovych and his ilk, and others - fight with the Germans. They strike outposts, rail lines, collaborators, and others. If we can restore contact, if we can rebuild relationships, they may yet serve and assist the cause. Even if it is only as a distraction to the hated occupiers."
 UKR_unleash_sluzhba_bezpeky_desc: "Though immensely saddening, it is a matter of fact that our movement is not free of its own criminals, traitors, and unreliable elements - and to deal with them effectively the Sluzhba Bezpeky must be properly empowered and supported. Currently it is not, and this threatens not only Bandera's wishes but also his great vision for our future.\n\nTheir role is critical, and this degradation of their capability cannot be allowed to continue. They need a fresh breath of life, they need resources. We will provide them."
 UKR_galicia_forays_desc: "Centuries ago, Europe suffered under the black plague due to their lack of knowledge of the impact rats and vermin can truly cause on civilized society; Disease, rot and decay, the breakdown of order, and ultimately death is what follows any state that ignores the threat the vermin can bring to them, be they literal or metaphorical.\n\nThe Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army is such vermin, a taint that touches every good Ukrainian, distorting their mind, and yet even cockroaches have the sense to not be prideful of their loathsome existence, something that even the UNRA fails at. It's time we smoke out these pervasive syncophants from Galicia like one would do to a rat warren."
 UKR_instill_commandments_desc: "Nothing instills more pride in being Ukrainian than a march of proud, steel-faced soldiers, weapons held high, nothing but pride and love for our flag and utter contempt to any that would dare besmirch it, those people that are malleable, fickle and too embroiled in fear, sloth, and greed.\n\nGaze upon our flag! Look at the beauty of our land, our pure people! Our Vozhd, our history, our lineage! This pride, this joy in our nation is something we can't ever grasp, but to even encapsulate the magnitude of the love we should feel for Ukraine is too much for a mere individual.\n\nBut our soldiers will not be mere individuals. Theirs is a collective mind, a realm that this love will fill wholly, push away anything that is unnecessary to it, until they are as zealous and dutiful as our magnanimous leader."
 UKR_insurgency_years_desc: "Since the dawn of the Nazi occupation, the UPA has had many brave souls who have fought for Ukraine, some still fighting since the revolutions of 1917. Ukraine's greatest army is deeply privileged to bear witness to such patriots fighting on our behalf, but we must not waste this privilege. Not all our newest recruits are trained in even a quarter of the skills that these soldiers are, and it's high time we change that.\n\nThe best of our best need to train those newest recruits of ours, lest the masses of our armies remain untrained rabble. Through training these men in skills only our veterans can count themselves knowledgeable in, then and only then can we well and truly prepare for the revolution as we need to. The tactics of the Germans will be taught, the importance of keeping cool will be taught, and plain tips of accuracy will surely become widespread. Before long, this army of ours will know how to shoot and kill better than any Wehrmacht garrison could summon in even its worst nightmares."
 UKR_marshal_craftsmen_desc: "While we are very short on manpower, and can technically arm those soldiers we do employ, to say that we can \"arm\" them is a very, very generous term considering the weaponry we do have. Many of our soldiers still fight with the weapons of their grandfathers, and even some of our stocks of Mosin-Nagants are older than them.\n\nLuckily, however, these are not the majority, not yet, at least. We do maintain some gunsmiths that keep us armed with relatively modern, Ukrainian weapons. Even still, they are not enough, not yet. Training some of our aspiring gunsmiths in their skills will increase our weapons output significantly- soon, our soldiers will not only be fighting with knives and hunting rifles but genuine Ukrainian automatic weaponry."
 UKR_carpathian_connection_desc: "Many years ago, our brethren in the Carpathians dreamt of a state, a place for the Carpatho-Ukrainians to call their own. For a brief moment that dream was almost realized - before the Hungarians killed it in its cradle. Most moved on and settled. But not all.\n\nSome of them never stopped resisting, and though their numbers are small (and have only dwindled over time), those who remain have skills and knowledge almost beyond compare. We must win their allegiance, and put those qualities to use."
 UKR_steadfast_watchers_desc: "We have fought, bled, and died for years, fighting for the people of Ukraine and for the Permanent Revolution. Most of our people recognize that. Most - but not all. Far too many seem to have forgotten the sacrifices made by us to fight the Germans, and flirt dangerously with the Republican scourge. A reminder is needed.\n\nSome of the most prominent faithless will be located and dealt with, publicly. The people will know that we are both steadfast and watchful, and always ready to excise the cancer of faithlessness."
 UKR_blood_soil_desc: "Let there be no one that claims we haven't given diplomacy a chance.\n\nMany times we've reminded the illegal occupiers to whom the soil they toil truly belonged, the crime of their stay upon our legitimate territory, and as long as they left with their corruptive elements and people, we would be willing to let bygones be bygones; their time would come but not by our hand, as long as they stopped slighting us.\n\nBut so they still stay, breeding like rabbits, despoiling and twisting our history with their mere breath, taunting us by their mere stubbornness and disregard of our warnings! If they love our territory so much, let their blood and bodies be the fertilizer of the next generation of Ukrainians, claiming the land they rightfully deserve."
 UKR_wraiths_night_desc: "The first struggle, years ago, taught us many imperative, costly lessons. The initial mass uprisings were nearly crushed immediately, and those soldiers of ours that survived the repressions or were just plain lucky learned to survive- they had no other choice. The aircraft that bombed us, the tanks that rolled over our barricades, and the patrols that kept us underground all led to our slaughter. And yet?\n\nWe adapted. We learned to sabotage the planes before they even got off the pavement. We learned to throw Zhdanov Cocktails into the exhaust ports of Panzers, and to create IEDs. We learned to hide and ambush the incessant patrols, and to loot them before anyone could realize that the patrols had been wiped off the map. And the Germans haven't forgiven themselves for it since. Even still, not all of these tactics are yet codified, and therefore we need to spread them to all our soldiers on the ground. The Nazis only despise us for all we've done, and we are far from done with them yet."
 UKR_farmer_chemist_desc: "The Panzers that keep the German jackboots on our necks are not invincible, not so like the Luftwaffe, but unlike the Luftwaffe, we have found ways to destroy these armored scourges.\n\nImprovised explosive devices. IEDs, for short, is the perfect solution to the problem of German tanks annihilating our ground forces. The German tanks fear us for what we've been capable of doing to their tanks since the '50s, and that has only come with practice and refinement of our IEDs. It seems that the one material we need the most for these new designs, funnily enough, is fertilizer. Where else can we find fertilizer than from farm slaves? Cooperation with those that have recently broken out or been liberated from plantations can aid us greatly in IED production. Before long, Ukraine will be free from German armor, one Panzer at a time."
 UKR_odessa_operatives_desc: "It is understandable - but most regrettable - that so many of our so-called brothers and sisters have accepted Rumanian domination, in Odesa and the territories around it, in order to live free of Nazi tyranny. However, and though few in number, some among them are willing to fight for a free Ukraine.\n\nContact has been made, and they are willing to assist in smuggling weapons through Odesa's connections to the wider world. For a price. One that we are willing to pay."
 UKR_gun_down_guard_desc: "The reach and membership of the Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army is far, far greater than was reported or expected. Operatives of the UNRA have been found everywhere, spread among the lower rungs of state organs. Safehouses and caches have been found in abundance, and it is clear that the UNRA is attempting to turn the Ukrainian people against us.\n\nThis cannot be allowed, and Stetsko has made it clear that if we let their rot spread uncontested it could smother us in short order. We will take action. We will strike the UNRA, and reclaim our position and security."
 UKR_traitors_due_desc: "Although none would argue that the republicans, decadent and bloated as they are, are not a threat to the state, Stetsko focuses all too much upon them, somehow seeing their weakness as strength. In doing so, however, he misses the true threat - the Melnykite Jews, who lined their pockets through German collaboration for years.\n\nThese traitors cannot be excused, and we will not make the same mistake as Stetsko. We will identify the ones to make examples of, and for the rest we will ensure that they know their days are numbered."
 UKR_nationalist_commissariat_desc: "As the national struggle continues, we must remain focused on our ultimate goal - victory - and on what is needed in order to attain it. One such need is dedication. Morale. Commitment. In that we must realize that Shukhevych, while correct about the criticality of peasants forming the backbone of struggle, is not appreciating their other, less desirable qualities.\n\nWe must have men who will not be easily confused or led astray, and in that we must accept that recruitment must be concentrated among men who can enforce Bandera's teachings. In this we will have dedicated soldiers, and no issues of morale."
 UKR_return_roots_desc: "Across all of Europe, who could understand subjugation better than a Ukrainian? A Ukrainian farmer. Across all our history, from the enslavement of the vile Russians, to the authoritarian centralizations of the Soviets, few have been beaten worse than the humble, average farmer. They are the basis of Ukrainian culture, the very concrete of our state, and they seem to know it.\n\nAcross Western Ukraine, rural farming slaves have escaled, and banded together to form militias in light of the growing anarchy across Ukraine. With some persuasion, it seems all too possible that these farmers' militias can be drawn into our great alliance, and we can fight for our freedom- together. Farmer and soldier, together. Only then can we ensure Ukraine is free."
 UKR_thunder_mountains_desc: "The Carpathians are a wonderful place for anyone to disappear, be that for a journey of self-discovery, for crimes, or just as likely for a struggle against foreign oppressors. We of course made good and strong use of these mountains during our First Struggle against the Poles, the Moskals, and the Germans. We would attack where they expected least, then quickly disappear into the mountains; by the time they noticed something was off, we were hidden away, heavy equipment and all. Of course, this means that the recent reports that our men have managed to find old artillery from the First Struggle hidden away in those mountains are no surprise to us. Let us direct the men to pull these guns out of their various hidey-holes; it will afford us some good firepower."
 UKR_born_great_hour_desc: "The Reichskommissariat—that abomination of the German bastards, built to oppress good Ukrainian sons—is at last collapsing under the weakness of the feckless Koch and his degenerate ministers. It is clear, now, with the news of the old son of a whore in Germania dying, that no better opportunity exists for us to liberate great Ukraine.\n\nWe were born in a great hour: an hour of valiant resistance and combat for the freedom of Ukraine. Though we met with defeat time and again at the hands of the Moskals, the Germans, and the Poles, we bled them white and remained able to fight every time they thought they had won. We are the warriors born to free our beloved Ukraine. Under the Vozhd, we are certain to obtain victory—to purify and liberate the Ukrainian state!\n\nO Bandera, our father and liberator, look upon our fight with pride! By God we swear that Ukraine shall be free once more and built in the way you envisioned!"

Supporting bandits, partisans, traitors, and degenerates at every turn, they consume valuable food and resources. But what if they didn't?\n\nWhat if we took their precious food that they \"need\" to survive and teach them a lesson they are not liable to forget?

They have helped prop up our rule and even loyally obey their betters.\n\nWhile they are still a minority of their people, perhaps we should show them just a tiny amount of leniency, a miniscule concession made more tolerable by how few of them there are. Of course, we will still take what we need. But if they have more, then they can keep it. If they stay loyal. Hell, when all this is back to normal, we might even be able to give them back a little.

They say entire villages have been depopulated. Crops needed to feed thousands are instead being taken to feed the Wehrmacht. Even German settlers—for whom we began this entire enterprise!—are beginning to see the effects of this chaos. Ukraine, the alleged breadbasket, is starving to death, and we are why that is happening.\n\nSo long as we win, it does not matter. But that needs to be soon."

We were told that entire villages have been depopulated, groups of ten or more going silent at a time. Crops needed to feed thousands were instead being taken to feed the Wehrmacht. We thought this was bad when we heard of it. Somehow it has gotten worse.\n\nVillages are literally gone, burned to ashes where at least there were structures before. Their inhabitants have been slaughtered or forced to flee, whether German or Ukrainian. In several regions there are mass graves far as the eye can see.\n\nDeath. Destruction. Ruin. The cities are not safe, and the wilderness is no improvement. There is no refuge for anyone, not even for our own people. There is only the light at the end of the tunnel—the light of victory.

Reichskommissariat Ukraine, backstabbed by its own alleged servants and subverted by Slavic degenerates in the service of Judeo-Bolshevism, is on the verge of total collapse.

Our own settlers that we brought here cannot even eke out a living anymore, and our soldiers' situation worsens minute by minute.§!\n\n§eWe have been shattered into a million pieces.\nAnd more and more, it looks like we cannot put ourselves back together.§!"
 UKR_directive_no_46_desc: "On the 28th of October 1942, our beloved Führer, Adolf Hitler, issued a Führer Directive, his forty-sixth. Declaring that \"in the entire eastern territory the war against the partisan\"—that is, bandit— \"is a fight to the complete extermination,\" he insisted correctly that \"utter brutality\" was needed. In those days, Koch and all those underneath him took to the Führer's commands with alacrity, to impressive effect.\n\nToday, with the Führer dead and Koch wounded, we must return to that old elevated and correct path. We must throw off the gloves and do whatever it takes to exterminate these pests according to the Führer's will. Either they will die, or we must—there is no room in this Reichskommissariat for us to 'coexist'."
 UKR_a_second_operation_hannover_desc: "Sometimes, a bandit does not think twice before defying the Reich to its face. Seized by some foolish notion of bravery, as if they were Götz von Berchlingen or some lesser local folk hero, they decide that they have to attack German forces head on. Obviously, they pay a price—and that is Operation Hannover in a nutshell.\n\nOperation Hannover was one of the Reich's main successes against partisan bandits. The degenerate fools sought a direct confrontation against our superior forces. They were obliterated by the Wehrmacht for their trouble, and partisan operations in the Smolensk region were rendered nonexistent for several years. If we manage to get the partisans to fight us directly rather than hiding away like the animals they are, victory cannot but come quickly."

We cannot feed a force adequate to crush the uprisings with our current allocation of resources, and what food we have is disappearing daily due to sabotage and banditry. The military situation is untenable—with bandits and subversives everywhere we look, how would it not be?\n\nBut we have a cure.\n\nIn the leadup to the Reich's great triumph against Judeo-Bolshevism, Herbert Backe and Georg Thomas devised a great plan to ensure that our forces could be fed and extraneous populations could be eliminated. Taking food from the unworthy, giving it to the stronger, the better to guarantee their survival in preference to their inferiors. With some changes, we can apply this to our situation and rescue ourselves from the pit."
 UKR_you_dont_get_to_choose_desc: "We have made ourselves abundantly clear, explaining the situation as if our Slavic interlocutors were five years old, but some men apparently still fail to understand the situation. These people somehow have deluded themselves into disagreeing with hard, cold reality—that the luxury of choice cannot be afforded while barbarians continue to knock down the gates.\n\nLet us say it to them once more. We will... remind the Slavic subhumans in our lands of their servitude to the Reich, and of their only choice—obedience. They have but one alternative to this: death. Weak though we are, we can provide that to them if they shout for it loudly enough."
 UKR_expand_the_una_desc: "The rebellion continues and the assorted traitors continue to make gains at the expense of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Bandits have proliferated left, right, and centre; our Ukrainian Wehrmacht cannot hope to sustain the fight against them on its own. It helps nothing that Germania, itself in chaos, cannot hope to take action or send us anything but 'fraternal National Socialist greetings'.\n\nIt galls us, but we have only one real alternative—the Ukrainians. We will move to bolster the Ukrainian National Army; not so much so as to become a tangible threat, of course, but just enough where it can be of use to us in our fight to pacify Ukraine."
 UKR_were_all_in_this_together_desc: "From the outset in 1919, as our Führer Adolf Hitler taught us, the National Socialist system was always built on unity of the Aryan people. It was this unity that sustained us through 1933 as the decadent liberals were thrown aside. It was this unity that invigorated us in our great war against degeneracy in 1939, and in our defence against the communists in 1941 and the 1950s.\n\nWhat does this lead us to conclude? There cannot be any response to a crisis but collaboration. Had the Volk not cooperated in its struggle against degeneracy and Bolshevism, how would it have triumphed? The administration of this Reichskommissariat is in its darkest hour. If we fight among ourselves to see who is strongest now, those weak bandits that call themselves 'liberators' shall triumph.\n\nThis cannot be allowed."

One would think that after such progress we would have been able to root out sentimentalism and demonic concepts of sympathy for the subhuman enemy that we are rooting out.\n\nBut no! It seems that not everyone is on board with our plan. Some weaklings bow to delusional concepts of \"morality\" (as if there was any other morality other than that which the Führer handed down to us), or of \"winning over the populace\" (as if there is any use winning over subhumans), and other such nonsense. We are National Socialists; letting these things hold us back is the height of folly.\n\nThis fact will be made very clear to the head of this gang of sentimentalist near-traitors, Hans-Otto Bräutigam. That man is on thin ice; the rest of the Security Council will not tolerate his endless ramblings condemning our policies. Best we warn him and give him one last chance—after all, he is still a German."

One would have thought—or, perhaps, hoped is more accurate—that we would have shut them up and purified the dross from National Socialism in Ukraine. But we hope in vain.\n\nNational Socialism is being corrupted. Rumours spread of quiet dissent to our handling of the war—worse yet, the people sent to rebuke them come away doubting our views. Sentimentalist sentiments, that we thought we had extirpated, are spreading like cancer throughout the administration.\n\nWe are diseased.\nVictory is the only cure.\nIt must come fast."

Putting his thoughts on paper usually helped him, that was his profession after all, but he was too caught up in his own mind. He was too distracted with his work, or lack thereof, to notice Taras Borovets' third knock at his door. Nevertheless he gave it another go, which startled Stus back to attention.\n\n\"Right, come in,\" He said, shuffling his papers to the side. Borovets stepped inside.

Most of its workers were dead: killed by the many famines the city had experienced, fled west or into the swamps, or simply went as most did into the hollow and emaciated remnants of the city. Anything useful had been pilfered, leaving the rest to rust and crumble, to be viewed only from a distance and as yet another meaningless ruin amongst what was once a bustling metropolis. Within these snow-covered structures, where must was the smell and the empty coldness of a tomb was the sight, lay the last remnant of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic.\n\nOleksander Shumskiy's face was only illuminated by a single gas lamp, while his 'office' of iron sheets and curtains remained dark and obscure. Shumskyi's eyes slowly moved to the next paper in his pile. He missed music, that would make it better, enlivening this dungeon and lightening the rhythmless drudgery. Shumskyi picked up yet another paper, a report.\n\nScenes of devastation; charred bodies, crushed skulls, burning homes, and burning churches; a retaliation expedition, the report said. Shumskyi had seen it all, and not just in pictures. He hated to admit it, but he thought it all stale now. Women and children - even that note could not break his heart any further. What had the raid that had prompted this massacre accomplished? A few rifles and boxes of bullets, already at the cost of ten men. Shumskyi felt his surroundings grow colder. This couldn't go on. Recruitment was nonexistent, and the younger generation cared more for their next handful of bread than freedom.\n\nNo. Shumskyi straightened. The raid may have ended in massacre, but that only proved that if their oppression continued, death would be their fate.

He saw a bit of himself in the younger man - Drozdenko was not particularly sophisticated in his understanding of Marx or Lenin, but he had the devotion, the energy, and the willpower required of the professional revolutionary.\n\nNot that Richytskyi lacked those qualities. He was old now, but the past twenty years had done nothing to dim his convictions. From his own time in the USDRP organizing revolution against the puppet Hetmanate in the closing days of the First World War, to forming the UKP out of disgust at Petlyura's increasing conservatism, to the lessons Lenin and Skrypnyk had impressed on him, to his fights with Russian chauvinists in the Union, Andriy Richytskyi had come to view his life as singularly devoted to one task.

 UKR_intro_chain.19.desc: "\"Where do you think you're going, whore?!\"\n\nKyi bit back a curse as he instinctively ducked into the mouth of a nearby alleyway. Down the street, the usual group of Hitler Youth thugs were once again harassing some poor girl. He had attempted to time his trip to the bakery well enough to avoid them, but now they were standing in between him and his home, plus they were bullying this woman. He tucked the bread into his coat and picked up a hefty stone that fit nicely in his hand. Peeking out of the alleyway for a moment and aiming for the biggest kid he could see, Kyi chucked the rock at him and ran for it.\n\nHe sprinted down the alley, dodging trash and hopping puddles before ducking down a side street, finding himself in a dead end face to face with a towering wooden fence. If there was any way he was going to get away, this was it. He clambered over, doing his best to protect the bread by landing squarely on his back.\n\nKyi heard the clattering of boots passing by, but was too transfixed by the sight in front of him to think about it. He found himself in a courtyard littered with posters, notices, and graffiti. \"Workers of Ukraine, unite!\" \"Live and die for the republic!\" \"A Ukraine ruled by Ukrainians!\" One poster fluttered off of the wall and towards the ground, but Kyi rushed forwards and snatched it out of the air. Printed across the front of the sheet was simple black text: \"Imagine a free Ukraine.\"\n\nKyi tried to do just that. What would a free Ukraine mean? Would it mean a Ukraine where he's free to eat a meal every day, rather than splitting his loaf of bread with his sister? Would it mean a Ukraine where his sister was free to go to the store by herself without being harassed by the Aryan thugs every day? Would it mean a Ukraine where he could leave Kyiv whenever he pleased, instead of being stuck here for the last 15 years of his life? Kyi wanted to find out."

 UKR_intro_chain.20.t: "Looking for the Past"
 UKR_intro_chain.20.desc: "Kyi dodged his way around patrols and through alleyways until he arrived at a hidden market, where he was certain that something useful would show up. He decided to look for something about the Ukraine that he was never taught, but Kyi soon found himself wandering in circles, unsure of where to look for such a risky item, or even if such an item existed anymore. As Kyi grew more sure of the futility of the search, an old man pointed at him and beckoned him over with a gnarled, twisted appendage that, many years ago, must have been a finger. At wit's end, Kyi shuffled over to the old cripple, who he knew as Taras.\n\n\"Looking for something, Kyi?\" he croaked, keeping a steady eye on his prospective customer. Kyi spoke, slightly louder than a whisper.\n\n\"I'm looking for anything about...\" He looked around, apprehensive to sharing his quest with a stranger. In hushed tones, he continued, \"About the history of Ukraine. I want to know what happened before the Germans. What was Ukraine, before all this?\" He gestured around vaguely, perhaps towards Kiew, perhaps towards Ukraine. Grinning a half-toothless smile, Taras hobbled over to a nearby trash heap, dug around for a moment, then hobbled back over to Kyi, carrying a dusty brown package. Kyi held out the stolen pack of his father's cigarettes, which Taras took as he placed the package in Kyi's hand.\n\n\"Slava Ukraini,\" Taras whispered. \"Now get home, before you get both of us shot!\" Taras chuckled dryly, as he leaned back to watch the young lad sprint off towards home. Needless to say, this was all highly illegal. As soon as Kyi returned home, he hid in his room and tore the packing to get to what was inside: a book. On the cover, in soft grey lettering on a dingy yellow background, the words \"The Complete History of Ukraine and Her People\" shined through the grime. Kyi spent the night, and a better part of the next morning, reading intently through the old tome."

 UKR_intro_chain.21.desc: "Thoughts of the past filled Kyi's mind; what was there to know that he had been kept from? What people had been before him, what great men and women shaped the land he called home? Such questions in a schoolroom would end with his family being enslaved - or worse - and any attempts to pry the information from his Father had ended in stern dismissive platitudes about a son's duty to his family and the price they could all pay for young Kyi's curiosity. His questions would remain unanswered over a supper of bread and cabbage stew.\n\nSulking silently in his bedroom, Kyi was thinking of ways to learn the truth when he heard shouts from outside. Quickly, he stowed the book under his bedding, and peeked his head over the windowsill to view the commotion outside. To his horror, an Opel Blitz had parked in front of a neighboring building. However, to his great relief, the unloaded soldiers headed instead to an adjacent warehouse, far away from Kyi and his treasonous thoughts. After a moment, and as suddenly as Kyi could duck and cover behind the wall, a series of shouts, a cacophony of gunshots, and the hollow din of a small explosion filled his buzzing mind with ringing.\n\nNot more than half of a minute had passed before everything was still and quiet again. Kyi, after much consideration, peeked his head back above his cover, only to gaze upon the remains of a dozen German soldiers, laying bloodied and ravaged in the dirt streets, lit only by the dim glow of a distant streetlamp. The Opel Blitz was gone, and not a soul was to be seen.\n\nKyi wondered, with a still rapidly beating heart, what he had just witnessed, and who would dare to be so brave as to assault a garrison. The thought of Ukrainians fighting for their homeland against an oppressive regime filled Kyi with a new feeling, one he could not remember feeling for a long, long time: hope."

 UKR_intro_chain.22.desc: "Kyi had spent less than a week reading the great book from front to back. The plight of his people captivated him, and remained always on his mind. After finishing the book for the second time, Kyi went out for a walk. It was well past midnight, and the patrols were scarcely a concern under the cover of a moonless night. Even if they were, Kyi only thought of the partisans he saw the other day, and of his role in the great story of a future Ukraine. He found himself at the banks of the Dnieper River, pondering what he could do, not knowing what he could do, let alone what he wanted to do.\n\nAs he began the trek home, a familiar voice called out to him. Taras, from under a nearby bridge, had once again beckoned him near and tried to compel Kyi to confide in him. Ceaseless questions regarding the book, his thoughts, his desires, his worth. Kyi dodged all the questions, tactfully giving curt and vague answers, revealing his inner confusion. Then, as he tried to leave again, Taras shouted out to him.\n\n\"Remember your people, Kyi! Remember your mother!\" Kyi had never known his mother, and his curiosity once again got the better of him. Now, it was his turn to ask question after question. However, Taras was not so timid in his answers, and told Kyi about his mother's torture, rape, and murder. He went on about the screaming, the whimpering, the wrenching sobs, and the gunshot. He did not enjoy telling the truth, nor did Kyi enjoy hearing the truth. By the end, Kyi had made up his mind. He didn't yet know who he would throw his lot in with, but he knew that he must fight against the Germans in any way he could. As Kyi started home for good, Taras yelled one last bit of encouragement:\n\n\"Never forget your roots! Never forget your people's history!\" Kyi felt dedicated to those memories: his country, his people, his mother. He made up his mind: he had to leave."

After all, the situation with the partisans had not improved and on top of that, Ohlendorf, Leibbrandt, and Bräutigam were still vying for power as always. However, Koch's secretaries would soon realize the cause of his joy when he sent them a message: he would be leaving for East Prussia in the next few days and would spend a few weeks up there.\n\nAs he furiously packed his belongings, a smile remained plastered on his face. Koch had spent the past 20 years stuck in this miserable position of Reichskommissar of Ukraine and having to deal with the natives and his fellow Germans alike. All of them seemed ready to pounce upon him and eat him alive like vultures at the slightest showing of any sort of weakness. Now though, now he could go back to his adopted home. Memories of his time as both Gauliter and Oberpräsident of East Prussia filled his mind as he continued to back.\n\nBack in those days, before Barbarossa, before being appointed to this backwater of a Reich, he had been the one in charge of the region and second only to the Führer himself. He had purged his domain of poverty and unemployment, and East Prussia had become a beacon of prosperity for the entire Reich.\n\nAs he finished packing his things, he looked towards his desk and thought of something. Perhaps this vacation of his could be an opportunity? Perhaps the Reichskommissar could pull some strings to not only be able to resign from his position, but to get his old titles back in East Prussia? Erich's smile grew ever wider as he prayed to God that what he plotted would come to pass."

Yet she was excited for the lengthy reprieve, and her husband had taken her out after getting a raise.

On any other day, that bartender wouldn't have been so generous, but soon he bought the happy couple a round, and shared the news with the other patrons. However, just like beer from a broken mug, information seeps outside of where it was supposed to stay.\n\nOn any other day, with any other secretary, or with any other Reichskommissar, it might have been a different story. But on this day, a patron walked out from that bar, finished his drink, and mumbled something about how even Koch was abandoning this hellhole.

His office work as of late had been dreadfully dull, more so than usual, as nothing interesting or new had happened in the days prior. A chauffeur knocked on his office door, already carrying his baggage. Despite his elation that the day of departure had finally arrived, Koch curtly informed the chauffeur that he would be driving his own car, and that he only needed his bags moved. The chauffeur left, and Koch excitedly leapt as quickly as his age would allow after the young man, eager to become airborne.\n\nAside from the increasingly warm disposition of his office staff, nearly nothing had happened in the office since he had announced he was leaving. It was slowly driving Koch mad, but he kept his composure knowing that soon, very soon, he would be aloft and away from this miserable place. Happy thoughts were on Koch's mind as well; the cliques he lorded over abstained from their typical bickering, the Resistance Activity Reports had slowed to an insignificant crawl, and partisan activity was gleefully minimal. Had it been any other day, Koch would have noticed these quiet discrepancies and would have been disturbed. However, in a mere 45 minutes, it would no longer be Koch's problem - not until he eventually returned from Ostpreußen.\n\nOn any other day, Koch would have noticed the small crowd that had gathered to see him off, but he was beyond caring. As soon as the trunk was shut, Koch had shut his door and began to reach for his keys. On any other day, he might have waited for a brief moment to relish in his delight. On such a day, he might have heard the hushed ticking of a timer, mechanically counting away at the seconds and minutes and hours since it had been set. Alas, today was not such a day.

Leibbrandt was a useless, vestigal figure, and had been for half a decade. For Bräutigam, Leibbrandt's reforms were hollow, ready to be pushed aside by a new generation. For Ohlendorf, they were actively damaging to the threads of German society. To both, and to many others in their factions, life under Leibbrandt seemed simply intolerable.\n\nSo, forced together by circumstance, the diplomat and the policeman forced Leibbrandt's hand. Together, they came to the deputy with a plan to share power, as leaders in a temporary \"Security Council\". Leibbrandt would head the government, but now as head of a larger body of leading German officials, of which a considerable number would be on the side of his newfound enemies.\n\nLeibbrandt did not even have time to panic.

A blitzkrieg of propaganda crashed through the walls of his mind, and day-by-day holding onto the past became harder and harder. By the time he landed in Moskowien with a rifle on his back, he had firmly taken the easy way out.\n\nYet grasping those fascist values was an act done for more than mere convenience, as unthinking as it was. Pieter's German fluency, his Wehrmacht rank, his growing kill count, all these gave him a meaning that his family and friends in Holland could not match.

Pieter was the perfect Aryan soldier, contributing to a Reich that would long outlast the failed state it had absorbed.\n\nEventually, Pieter's service ended with a shot to the shoulder, and he was asked to begin a new task: settling Ukraine. It was a new ideal to aspire to, and Pieter jumped at the opportunity. Quickly, he found himself a wife in an old flame from secondary school, and rushed off to a homestead near Kiew to begin once more.\n\nNow, he has found his new routine, tilling and harvesting, waking at sunrise and sleeping at sunset. It is far from his urban life in Amsterdam, but Pieter does it all the same.

The Reich had great expectations for its children, both their role and their abilities. Markus could not be left behind by his nation. When he saw his child cry, Pieter could barely exist in that moment. He could only imagine the grave emptiness of a man who cannot serve their nation, or aid their family.\n\nMarkus understood none of this.

It was a clear sign of an awful fate, and a source of endless, undying concern.\n\nAs the day passed, Antonia watched as the news crumpled her husband.

It seemed this class was very important.\n\nYet the class made little sense to Markus. His teacher told the class that Ukraine was a province of the Reich - once full of Ukrainians, but now full of healthy, Aryan Germans. Yet Markus had seen many Ukrainians near his house, and there were no Germans nearby for him to play with. Why had he been forced to live with the Ukrainians?

 UKR_NosenkoIntro.2.t: "Art Is Dead, and They Killed It"
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.2.desc: "Halyna, hunched over a box in the cellar, read the last two words of the poem, the signature of the author. Ironically for a poet, it was messy chickenscratch, but Halyna already knew what it said by handwriting alone. Danylo Nosenko. She abandoned what had initially brought her there, a search for an old sewing kit, and headed back up the stairs, leaving the basement turned upside down. Grinning, she approached her husband with purpose she hadn't felt in ages. He was characteristically buried deep in a book in the kitchen. He lowered the tome slightly to get a look at his wife, who presented the poem to him. \"You wrote this, Danylo?\"\n\nDanylo gently took the crinkled old paper and ran his eyes over it. His lips curled into a bittersweet smile, \"You liked it, then?\"\n\n\"Liked it? Danylo, it's one of the greatest I've ever read,\" replied Halyna.\n\n\"I never thought it stood out from the rest of my work,\" said Danylo dismissively, placing it aside. He could tell what his wife was getting at just by the look in her eye, and braced for the coming words.\n\n\"I just think it's powerful. Have you thought about contacting one of your old friends in the underground? Getting it published? People need to hear this now more than ever!\"\n\nDanylo removed his glasses, shutting his eyes to rub his nose, visualizing the lifeless faces of dozens too idealistic to live. Shame, fear and grief boiled in his chest. \"I'm sorry, my love, but I can't risk it. Don't you remember what happened to Maksym? The Reich kills men for things like this, we have to face that this world they've created is no place for art.\"\n\n\"They would never know, Danylo.\""
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.2.a: "\"Someone always does here, Halyna.\""
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.3.t: "Shovels"
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.3.desc: "The shovel was heavier in Halyna's hand than she was used to. She wondered to herself if that meant she was getting older or hungrier. Probably both, she thought. Buying new equipment for the farm was always a pain, stealing her scant savings away from her and sending her on an unwieldy trek home.\n\nHer day continued to worsen, not just from the relentless, icy rain that turned the dirt road home to muck but additionally the flock of people crowding one of the few paved roads in town. As she neared, she heard a sound that made her blood boil. A German marching tune, coupled with the malevolent growl of truck engines, the ominous grinding of tank treads and uneasy, scattered applause from the wary crowd. With no way around, she waded through the throng to the curb where she could see the rather pathetically sized parade: four of five tanks, perhaps two platoons of men, a few outdated and rusted old trucks, and a military band that was struggling to breach the noise of the vehicles. Around her the crowd was clapping, some with genuine intensity and others with stilted insincerity. A man behind her nudged her, encouraging her to join in. She shook her head, gesturing to her shovel.\n\nUnable to leave, her anger only further simmered. It was nothing but a march of walking memories of waking nightmares. Their pace evoked the first march into the little town so long ago, the way they'd let the curtain fall on her home and suffocate it in misery. Their faces reminded her of the way they had spat on her and her people every day of their lives. Such hate and yet such pride. Worst of all, the trucks reminded her of Danylo's rare stories of the camp, before some old friend turned collaborator had bailed him out. She thought of his scars, like an abused animal. She was glad he was at home, not here. Obscenities tried to climb up her throat, so she bit her tongue. Violence crossed her mind, how satisfying it would be to let Nazi teeth fly with her shovel. She couldn't do that; she couldn't make Danylo a widower. She was all he had. Instead, she grinned until the last man passed, and walked home muttering."

 UKR_NosenkoIntro.4.desc: "A series of knocks made both of them turn their heads. Danylo frowned as he stood, while Halyna warily turned her attention to the door. A few explanations entered Danylo's mind - none of them good. They weren't expecting any guests, and the only possible visitors were ones who spelled trouble.\n\nIt was why he wasn't surprised to find a police officer on the other side of the door. It was an older man, with a square face, grizzled features, and of a large physique. \"Good afternoon, officer,\" Danylo said, keeping his voice polite. \"How can I help?\"\n\nAlways be proactive. Always be cooperative. Give nothing but compliance. It was the only reasonable approach when it came to law enforcement. The officer nodded slowly. \"We are tracking partisan activity in this area, and require any information you have about their whereabouts. We've had reports they've been seen around this residence.\"\n\nDanylo didn't know if it was a trick or not, but it didn't change his answer. \"I try to avoid trouble, officer. If there are unknown people around my house, I know as little as you.\"\n\n\"You are certain you have no knowledge at all?\" The officer pressed. \"Many partisans are not just in the streets. They hide among civilians, obscure their politics-\"\n\n\"Yes, officer, I am certain,\" he interrupted. \"Both my wife and I eschew politics, and have no desire to involve ourselves in them. We'll let you know if we see anyone suspicious, but I'm sorry, I can't tell you what you want to know.\"\n\nThe officer pursed his lips, obviously dissatisfied with the answer, though he seemed to realize that he wasn't lying. However, it didn't stop him from giving one final warning as he turned to leave:"

 UKR_NosenkoIntro.5.t: "Black Nights"
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.5.desc: "The best nights were ones where there was little to no natural light. These nights only occurred when the moon was dark, or clouds covered it. Halyna had learned to watch for such nights, and when they happened, to take advantage of them. They didn't know when the next one would come.\n\nShe'd remembered concern and fear she'd felt the first time she'd snuck out. Not for herself, but what might happen if Danylo woke up and feared the worst. Fortunately, he was a heavy sleeper, and she was less nervous when she slipped away into the night now. Not that she was gone for very long.\n\nThe package she clutched tightly wasn't large. It was mostly canned goods she'd hidden away over the course of a couple weeks, along with a few loaves of bread. It wasn't much, but she knew the local resistance needed every little bit. She knew she wasn't the only one who was giving them such packages either.\n\nAll of them needed to do their part; herself included.\n\nShe kept in the shadows, keeping a keen ear open in case she heard any cars or German patrols. Eventually, she turned into a small alley where one of the partisans was waiting; a young boy who knew to meet her when the moon was dark. She didn't know his name, she didn't ask, and she didn't want to know more.\n\nAll she did was hand him the package, which he quickly took, giving her a quick, quiet, but heartfelt \"Thank you.\" He quickly slipped away; she did the same and didn't let her guard down until she was back in bed with her husband.\n\nHer sleep afterwards was always better, as she knew that more packages like hers were being delivered across the city. She was glad that the resistance would last just a little longer because of her help."

 UKR_NosenkoIntro.6.t: "The Weight of Guilt"
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.6.desc: "The dinner before him was tasteless, and his appetite nonexistent. Danylo had wondered if he would feel better in the hours after the encounter with the youth, but if anything, the feeling of guilt and regret had only entrenched itself further. He wasn't doing a good job of hiding it either, and it seemed like his wife was finally going to ask.\n\n\"Do you want to tell me,\" she finally said, putting her fork down. \"Or do you want me to guess why you're been moping all day?\"\n\nHe picked at his meal, his voice halting; as if confessing. He supposed that was what this was. \"There was a young man. Trying to hide from the police. A partisan I think, at least that's what he looked like. He wanted to come in.\" He didn't look his wife in the eye as he finished. \"I told him to move on.\"\n\nA heavy silence fell over the dinner. Danylo finally looked up at Halyna, whose expression was upset - but mostly disappointed, which only made it worse. \"You shouldn't have done that,\" she finally said quietly. \"Even if we can't hide him... you could have given him a meal.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said quietly. \"I should have done something.\"\n\nHalyna's face softened, and she took his hand. \"There is nothing that can be done now. All we can do is pray that he is safe. We can do that much.\"\n\nPrayer was perhaps something that was too late now, but perhaps it was not. Perhaps a miracle could happen, and perhaps a prayer would assuage the guilt. Both of them bowed their heads, and offered a prayer for the young man - wherever he was."
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.6.a: "Neither expected to ever know if their prayer was answered."
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.7.t: "One Single Spark"
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.7.desc: "There was a spark in the atmosphere that Halyna hadn't felt in a very, very long time. At any other point, Danylo would tell her she was just being jittery. But everything was different now. Everyone had heard about Poland - and everyone knew what it could mean.\n\nThe atmosphere everywhere was charged. Fear and uncertainty in the eyes of the Germans; excitement and hope in the eyes of everyone else. All of Ukraine was holding their breath, waiting to see what would happen next.\n\n\"You know what this means,\" she told Danylo over breakfast. \"If Germany has lost control of Poland... if their stranglehold has broken there, then their power is broken and they know it.\"\n\nShe couldn't help the excitement spilling out of her voice; emotions long-suppressed rising to the surface. \"Ostland, Ukraine... even Moskowien... they're afraid that it might be over. If there was ever a time the Reich could fall...\"\n\nShe trailed off, as if finishing the sentence would somehow prevent its manifestation. There was still a hesitance; a fear that this would end in doomed futility, and this hope was an illusion. Yet the expression on her husband's face was almost serene, and without a hint of uncertainty. He smiled.\n\n\"It's 1917 again,\" he finally said, his voice musing. \"Even if it ends the same as before, I don't think there is a better year to repeat. Tyrants cannot be unchallenged forever.\"\n\nShe strongly agreed, and hoped that Poland was the first domino that would send the German empire crashing down. And if it fell, perhaps something better could finally rise in it's place. Throughout the rest of the day, her smile never faded. The faint embers of hope had been fanned-"

 UKR_BohdanIntro.1.t: "The Gunman"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.1.desc: "From behind the crest of the hill, Bohdan crouched, ready to take the shot. Behind him, two other partisans stood waiting for the kill. A car, painted black and adorned with German symbols, had just appeared.\n\nIt was close enough now - Bohdan fired. The glass of the car cracked, and the slumped, bloodied head of the driver smashed into the steering wheel. The car careened off the road, and the other partisans moved to finish their work.\n\nFrom his vantage, Bohdan could not see what his compatriots did next, but he heard the fire of their guns and the high-pitched crash of shattering windows. The mission was complete.\n\nAs the rest pulled the bodies from the vehicle, Bohdan walked towards the car, now a wreck on the side of the road. His eyes met with the driver's vacant stare. His face was bloody now, his skull cracked. He wore civilian clothes, with a watch on his arm.\n\nHad a small patch on his lapel, designating his race. He was a Ukrainian.\n\nBohdan turned away, filled with an ugly mixture of disgust and shame. This man was no comrade, of course, but he was no settler. A world of possible lives flew into Bohdan's head, possible realities of the man he had killed. Possible reasons he might have ended up a fascist's servant.\n\nBohdan turned from the car and began marching back up the hill, ready to return home. Germany's roots are growing, he thought to himself. No matter how many died, their replacements only seemed to grow more comfortable, dug further and further into the soil."

 UKR_BohdanIntro.2.desc: "The sun had set hours ago, and the fire was going out. The other soldiers had returned to their encampments - but Bohdan had been ordered to stay. He wasn't sure why. He watched the last embers fall, and waited for his next command.\n\nOut of the darkness, The division's commander spoke, his voice powerful yet only as loud as needed. \"Bohdan, I am concerned about your recent conduct. Your comrades have complained - you've been eating little, and rarely speaking with them. They say you seem to have forgotten the cause.\"\n\nBohdan took a long time to speak. \"I'm fine, I promise. I remain dedicated. I have devoted myself to our every mission, and I'm as accurate with a rifle as ever.\"\n\n\"Bohdan, I am no zealot, but I do believe a man has a soul - I've seen it burning in the heat of battle. A soul cannot survive off of pride in one's work alone. It needs hope. If you do not truly believe in the cause, sooner or later your soul will fail you, and you will waver.\"\n\nBohdan spoke quickly. \"I would never betray the cause, commander. I promise.\"\n\nThe commander gave a slight smile. Even in the last glimpse of light, Bohdan could see his commander's weariness. \"I believe you. But when the light returns tomorrow morning, take some time to read Lenin. A good soldier knows what to fight for.\""
 UKR_BohdanIntro.2.a: "The final embers crackled as the commander returned to his quarters."
 UKR_BohdanIntro.3.t: "The End"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.3.desc: "Deep in the forest, between scattered and hidden fortifications, a small fire roared. Around it, Bohdan and his fellow partisans quietly ate their fill. It was a disgusting meal, watery yet overwhelmed by the taste of buckshot, but Bohdan had come to accept such long ago. His commander stood above them, less imposing than usual. He had a look in his eyes - a slight squint. It flickered into Bohdan's view, then faded away just as quickly.\n\nAs the fire began to fade, the commander called his men to attention. \"Comrades, I have received some unpleasant news. The hideout of our fellow division, a few miles north of here, was uncovered by the Fascist government yesterday evening. We have received no word since. It is likely the worst has occurred.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time the commander had been forced to give such news. They'd heard the same story far too many times now. A simple fact was emerging, one that Bohdan knew the danger of internalizing fully: they might be dead tomorrow.\n\nA silence fell over the soldiers, only broken by their spoons and the occasional crackle of the fire. As the last gasps of the fire illuminated his comrades' faces, Bohdan could see that each was, in their own, quiet manner, grappling with the same fears, the same story."
 UKR_BohdanIntro.3.a: "And casting it aside."
 UKR_BohdanIntro.4.t: "The City"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.4.desc: "Despite himself, Bohdan was always frightened of the city. Yes, some part of him knew that these places had been built decades ago, even centuries. They were Ukrainian, same as the fields and forests he fought for every day. Yet for all his life, they had been German, outposts of state control and settlement with German names and a German way of life. Intellectually, he knew that was mere fiction. In the moment, standing between swastikas and police officers, it felt horribly real.\n\nBohdan still sometimes had to enter the city, however. Today, on the orders of his commander, he was in the heart of the Reichskommissariat - Kiew - looking to buy supplies for his fellow soldiers. Bohdan hoped that the captain's assignment didn't mean anything, given the risk of this mission. He feared that the man may have given up on him. Trust, he repeated to himself. Trust.\n\nFinally, he found the right house. He gave a knock on a back entrance, and a man appeared, thin and wiry with an odd expression. Bohdan ducked inside. For all his fears of the city, the room was small and unimpressive, and so was the deal. Some bandages and medicine for a king's ransom of foodstuffs. A bad deal, but a deal he was authorized to take.\n\nAs Bohdan left, the seller asked him why he bothers with these missions. He didn't know how to respond."
 UKR_BohdanIntro.4.a: "Bohdan mumbled something about liberty, and slipped into the night."
 UKR_BohdanIntro.5.t: "Faded Beauty"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.5.desc: "Bohdan proceeded at an urgent pace, driven by a bubbling mixture of anxiety and exhilaration. The small village wasn't the safest place to be, but it was better than where he had just been a few days ago, a city crawling with police, looking for him or at least men like him. It was an unfortunate necessity to pass through the town. When he'd tried the way he came, he'd seen Feldgendarmerie on patrol, examining every grain of wheat. He'd barely slipped away, with a wavering hand kept close to the pistol on his hip. They were likely already all over the region by now, and he had a sinking feeling they'd find the outpost in due time. Not before burning countless homes and fields, of course. This backroad, seemingly overlooked, would have to do. He'd only be here an hour, at most, he reasoned to himself.\n\nThe village was idyllic, in a dystopian way. It was surrounded on all sides by miles upon miles of farmland, but rising smoke sullied their beauty. An ugly Wehrmacht convoy in the distance did not ease his worries. The cobblestone streets and single story homes and businesses called back to a simpler time, but they still bore the scars of the occupation. The people were thin and clad in threadbare coats no better than wool sacks. There was a one armed, shivering man begging with a lost war playing out in his eyes. Lastly was a newspaper stand, much of its wares printed in German. Bohdan knew better than to interact with anyone, but he was tempted to learn how the plan had gone.\n\nHe dug a karbovanet out of the deep pockets of his coat and handed it to the man, who accepted it graciously in a strong German accent. Bohdan claimed a state-run rag of drivel, and scanned the front page. 'Reichskommissar Koch in Critical Condition After Bombing'\n\"Suka...\" He muttered. He had every policeman and soldier in Ukraine on his heels because of this operation, and the man wasn't even dead.\n\n\"Tragic, isn't it,\" said the German vendor. Bohdan blinked and gave a dazed nod."
 UKR_BohdanIntro.5.a: "Well then."
 UKR_BohdanIntro.6.t: "Flame, Lead, and Grief"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.6.desc: "As soon as Bohdan crested the hill and saw the fires, he knew what had happened. The hateful flames devouring that familiar patch of forest were hard to misinterpret. Nor were the tire tracks scarring the ash-laden mud and snaking off into the distance. He nearly broke into a sprint, but he knew better. Instead, he unholstered his sidearm and began to walk at a steady pace as the fire died down. By the time he was there, there were only cinders and the skeletons of trees.\n\nHe waded through the smoke, traversing the hellscape in search of the wooden bunker. He hacked phlegm into his sleeve as he choked on the smog. His foot caught on something and he wretched as he looked down on the charred face of a German trooper, his flesh chipping like bark. It brought him cold comfort that at the very least his cell had taken a few of the rats with them. He glanced over to the bunker's entrance, the way the wood had splintered and the structure had buckled, it looked like a maw of broken teeth.\n\nLurking closer, he stepped over the corpses of two partisans, too burnt to make out their identities. There was no doubt in his mind that they had been his friends, and he was forced to shove down his grief to proceed. The inside of the bunker wasn't much brighter, although the sun now shone through holes where the logs and earth had given way. He counted each body he saw, and with each one the despair was harder to ignore.\n\nIt all came to a head when he found his commander, the man who had taken him in and tried so hard to give hope to his lost soul. Now he was just another body, recognizable only by his uniform. Bohdan couldn't take it, falling out of time as he sobbed into his arm. There was nothing in or around him but pain. Eventually he remembered where he was and stood up, blurry eyed but purposeful. He retrieved a shovel from against the wall and dragged his commander out to a proper resting place - then the rest, until he was the last of his cell above ground."

 UKR_BohdanIntro.7.t: "Rubies in the Rough"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.7.desc: "In defiance of his legs' protests, Bohdan pressed on through the fields. The pain in his stomach far outweighed that in his limbs, even after hours of walking and burying friends. The full moon provided its gentle silver glow, painting the wheat grey. The light glinted off of grain silos and warehouses, turning them to frosted silhouettes. He noted a dormant tractor. He'd passed many that day. The countryside was all tools, no people, and plastered with the names of German companies.\n\nThe tractor was safe from this fate, its make showing it predated the occupation. Had he found the solitary family farm in these corporate plains? His aching stomach twisted like a vice. A family farm meant a farmhouse, a farmhouse meant a garden, and a garden meant real food rather than just endless grain. He moved further up the road, spotting a home.\n\nHis hopes fell when he reached a German sign at the edge of the property. Bohdan turned, clenching his fists. He'd have to find another garden. Looking around, he still only saw storehouses. He faced the house again, noting the tomato vines a ways into the perimeter. His gut churned, spurring his feet into action as he inched forward. He crawled through the farm like a pest, his heart pounding. Eventually he found a clutch of ruby red tomatoes and shoved them giddily into his pockets. Then, a light flicked on inside. He saw the shadow of a man with a rifle and immediately stood up, breaking into an agonizing sprint.\n\nA flashlight cut through the dark, just missing Bohdan as he tumbled over a short fence, sprawling flat on his stomach in the mud. Recovering as quickly as he could, he scrambled through the grass until the windows were dark again. He fell onto his back, now caked thoroughly with muck. His breaths quieted as he stared at the ink black sky, waiting for the stars to stop spinning. Gingerly, he retrieved a surprisingly pristine tomato from his coat. Shivering, he took a bite of the best tomato he had ever tasted."

 UKR_BohdanIntro.8.t: "Charity's Dead"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.8.desc: "The farmhouse was a sight for Bohdan's sore eyes. As well as his sore arms, sore stomach, sore legs and sore back. The tomatoes, divine as they had been, hadn't lasted him more than a few hours before his gut was pleading him to find something substantial. He felt he was in luck, however, as the warehouses and silos had begun to give way to humble, if somewhat desolate, homes. Most importantly they seemed to be Ukrainian homes from the occasional sign on the side of the road, so Bohdan approached the one before him in hopes of charity.\n\nHe took a deep breath, as if he were preparing to plead his case to the Reaper. He tried to make himself presentable, but there wasn't much he could do. Every inch of him was muddy, bloody or grass stained. He resolved to try to pat his wild hair down and button his coat, although in the process he realized a few had come off, then rapped his bruised knuckles against the door. His heart pounded for several seconds and he brushed his hair back once again. Slowly the door crept open and the bespectacled face of an old man emerged.\n\"Yes?\" He asked in a soft, yet defeated, tone. His left eyebrow arched as he observed the state of the ex-partisan.\n\nIt occurred to Bohdan that he hadn't even thought of what to say. Hunger clouded his mind as he stumbled over his next words, \"Good afternoon, sir. I've been walking for...\" He paused, \"Several, days. My home was burned in a German raid, I have no food or a place to sleep-\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, young man, but we've barely any to spare for ourselves,\" the aging man replied.\n\n\"Please, I could work on your farm! I can sleep outside,\" He pleaded as the man began to close the door. \"Please, don't,\" Bohdan scrambled for some half-hearted appeal to nationalism that he simply didn't have, \"we have to stick together -\" Suddenly the world felt colder for Bohdan as the door fell shut. \"For Ukraine...\""

 UKR_BohdanIntro.9.t: "Respite"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.9.desc: "Bohdan dipped his head into the creek. The cold water stung, but there was relief in the pain. He pulled his head free and watched the muck and blood slip downstream. The feeling of cleanliness was liberating, but he still could not help the worry that there was a gun trained at his back. He began moving back to the tree where he had laid his coat to dry. As he began to wipe his face with the sleeve, birds fled the trees of the glade at the sound of rumbling engines.\n\nHe hunched down, hoping the sparse canopy above him and the slope of the hill beyond the stream would shield him. His hand crept towards the pistol at his hip. The roar grew louder, heavier, and fiercer. Between the branches and over the hill Bohdan saw a military truck grinding down the road, festooned with the macabre heraldry of the Reich. The sight alone was enough for him to draw his weapon free and press himself against a boulder. The pounding of his heart joined the cacophony of mechanical noise, and for minutes he listened.\n\nHe hazarded a glance beyond the rock, allowing himself to stand to his full height and see more than a dozen trucks and armored cars on the move. He knew he was quite the public enemy, but surely they were not sending that much against a fugitive? His question was answered as they passed him by the same way they would the rest of the countryside. He fell back behind the stone, mortal fear receding in the face of confusion. He let the noise fade before slipping out, inching toward the hill. He winced as he left safety and came into full view of the road. A few hundred feet ahead was the last of the largest Wehrmacht convoy he'd seen in years, moving with urgency toward the horizon. He breathed a sigh of cautious relief and slid back down. Putting away his gun, he noted that his hands were shaking.\n\nThe only thing that shocked him more than this moment, one he'd spent years preparing for, was that he had no idea what to do."

Each quarrel was a petty obstruction to another man's ambitions.\n\nGeorg Leibbrandt read reports alone in his lamplit office on his Ukrainian National Council pet pupils. They suffered the same as he did, watching a land they cherished descend into decay. On the face of it, he was meant to be the most powerful in Ukraine, but insubordination haunted him at every step. Ohlendorf and Bräutigam had to be put in their places.\n\nOtto Ohlendorf finished compiling another list of recommendations - another set of initiatives Leibbrandt would dismiss or subvert. He was a weakling, grasping at concepts that he would hammer together as part of his grotesque fantasy for Germany's lands. What had he done to deserve being under that oafish Rosenbergite mind of his? It was a situation that had to change.\n\nHans-Otto Bräutigam worked through the night. He couldn't afford to take a break when his colleagues had already entrenched their positions. Leibbrandt promised reform and would deliver it in its barest form, and Ohlendorf promised his own brand of reform, but worryingly, he could deliver it to Ukraine in full.

The state's executive was, by very design, almost wholly dependent on his power and direction, and without it nobody knew what to do. But the bandits and rebels moved nonetheless. Someone had to take charge.\n\nThat someone was Georg Leibbrandt.\n\nUnderstanding the seriousness of the situation, he quickly worked to gather every senior official he could, and in this he surprised many. His well-known infuriating fashion for rational argument was dropped in favor of what could be called a plea, a plea that the state could not stand still. Not when its enemies were moving decisively. None could argue with that, at least, and before long the Security Council, as it had been so dubbed, was having its second meeting.\n\nA tense atmosphere hung over the event. Each fiefdom, carefully created and jealously guarded, felt that Leibbrandt was attempting to weaken them, centralizing power in himself.

Even, finally, from Ohlendorf, who broke silence several times to agree with the route of cautious reform - and the maintenance of order.\n\nSlowly, the wheels of 'government' began to once again turn."

The bombing of Koch, and the loss of his leadership had ended an undisputed chain of command, and presented opportunities that no one was willing to overlook - even as it risked further instability.\n\nThe ongoing war against the Ukrainian partisans continued to intensify, but it was no longer the only war that mattered. Within the Reichskommissariat administration, there was another, quiet war for influence beginning. The seeds had been planted long ago, and the bombing had brought them to bloom. Everyone appeared to realize their time was now - or never again.\n\nMany ranking officials and officers had aligned to, or rallied themselves around the three most important men in the Reichskommissariat - Georg Leibbrandt, Otto Ohlendorf, and Hans-Otto Bräutigam. Conventional wisdom had those looking from the outside-in believe that Leibbrandt had a clear advantage in this battle for influence as the Acting Reichskommissar.\n\nThe reality was not so certain.\n\nEach man had their own collection of allies, friends, and opportunists who sought to align themselves with the man they bet would emerge from this struggle victorious. Many others in the Reichskommissariat remained on the sidelines for now, unwilling to throw their support behind anyone until there was a clear frontrunner.\n\nOnly one thing for all of them was certain - the years of tension, rivalry, and ambition were coming to a head, and with Koch indisposed, it could not be stopped. Each man believed themselves the heir to the Reich's Breadbasket, and the only one who could lead it through the storm that had befallen them."

He heard another crack of rifle fire and his heartbeat quickened. As they got closer, they got more frequent, like a coming thunderstorm. He checked the ammunition of his own weapon, with not a single bullet fired. Despite ages of drills for this exact scenario, Johann could barely remember where he was. He had fled the second the tenth partisan emerged from the woods and the fourth bullet tore into Anton's chest, until this moment where he hid in some hallway nestled in the cold heart of the prison.\n\nHe listened to his radio crackle. The other soldiers likely wanted to know where he was, but every second there were fewer. They all stopped around the same time as the gunfire. The silence of the grave smothered him. He carried on, slowly retracing his steps. As he began to ponder surrender, he heard a voice behind him.\n\n\"Getting what's coming to you, then?\" A man spat from behind the bars of his cell. Johann had stumbled into the main ward and the whispers and venom had already begun to echo off the desolate walls. He turned on his heel, looking upon the emaciated ex-partisans. Their pleased grins contrasted their miserable condition, lending them the appearance of vengeful ghosts.\n\n\"Quiet! You're still prisoners of the... the Reichskommissariat. I'll have you all shot!\" He declared with less than certain conviction. All he got in return was laughter.\n\n\"Where's the rest of your little gang?\" Hissed the man from before, \"Did they all get killed, or did you abandon them?\" Soon, voices were calling out down the hall. Johann's Ukrainian was rough, but he knew they were coming for him. He braced himself as guilt and mortal terror seeped into his heart.

The partisan problem was proving resilient, and while one might expect the various militant interests in the Reichskommissariat be aligned, they were not. With the resources they'd recently been able to require, demands had quickly come from both the SS and Ukrainian National Army.\n\nThus, a dilemma emerged.\n\nThe UNA were, ultimately, collaborators, and while Korsch knew that they were important to the overall strategy for the region, he couldn't help but hold some wariness at arming Ukrainians further, especially with the partisan problem worsening.\n\nLoyalty concerns was the primary reason the SS was demanding the resources be allocated to them. Even if it wasn't strictly following protocols, there was no doubt that the SS were loyal to Germany, and Germany alone.\n\nAt the same time, this wasn't a choice of personal preferences - The request to supply the UNA came directly from the Deputy Reichskommissar, while the SS had made it clear that they were acting in Germania's interests. While defying the instructions of the Deputy Reichkommissar was almost unthinkable - potentially making an enemy of the SS was almost as bad.\n\nUnfortunately, he needed to make a choice, and throw his lot in with one side or the other."

He had been reviewing dossiers, threat assessments, and contingency plans, all to ensure he made an informed decision on a heavy question.\n\nWhat was the biggest threat facing the Reichskommissariat?\n\nThere were only three groups of real concern. There was the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, small in number, but fanatical Ukrainian nationalists who clung to the long-dead Bandera's dream. They were dangerous terrorists, but their minimal numbers made him wonder if it was worth the hassle.\n\nThe UNRA was more interesting to him - they were also Ukrainian nationalists who sought to create a republic, and were widely viewed as a more 'moderate' alternative to the radicalism of the UPA. As a result they had a wider base of support, though weren't as active, and the members weren't as fanatical.\n\nThen there were the remnants of the Ukrainian Red Army; communists hiding in the east who had survived like the cockroaches they were, despite continued efforts to quash them. Kling understood they retained some popular support, but as to their strength? He was doubtful it was enough to truly threaten the Reichskommissariat.\n\nIt was better to focus resources on one of these groups then spread his people too thin. He was confident that his men would be able to infiltrate, and build networks against any of these groups. He only had to give them a target.

The announcement had been a formality, as already Kampfgruppe officers were assuming control over the police forces, and preparing operations. Ohlendorf expected that there would be some kind of retaliation from Leibbrandt - as it was a clear challenge to his authority.\n\nStill, Ohlendorf doubted he could do much about it.

His home was a little way outside of Charkow, close enough that he could get back into the city should his presence be required, but remote enough that he had some peace away from the hustle and bustle of urban life. Ukraine, he mused, was a rather flat country. It must be rather unnerving to be a German here, used to the towering forests and the impenetrable Alps in their homeland. The seemingly endless plain was comforting to Heerema, though, reminiscent of the lowlands of Holland on which he lived as a boy. Perhaps he would buy an estate in Gotenland; the warm sea air would certainly bring no small amount of comfort in his daily life.\n\nA servant came to where Heerema was reclining, carrying a stack of papers and reports that signaled an end to his brief moment of idle leisure. Wordlessly grabbing the reports, his face fell into a slight frown at the sight of the numbers. Production values across the colony were stagnant, if not regressing. It was a death knell, one that had been sounding for quite some time now. Funding always seemed to make its way towards agricultural subsidies or combatting the rising bandit threat rather than his factories, leaving them underperforming compared to the rest of the Reich. He would be meeting with the acting Reichskommissar later in the week and had prepared a report that would be sure to show him that increased funding to the colony's burgeoning industry would result in greater returns for everyone involved.\n\nShooing the servant away, Heerema grabbed the open bottle of wine sitting on the table next to him and poured himself a glass. He raised the glass to the heavens in a silent salute, something that one might even call a prayer. A prayer to industry, a prayer to progress, and a prayer to the future of the Aryan race.

There were, in order, a row of chairs upon which Heerema was sitting; a desk, with a little telephone, behind which sat a diminutive secretary paying him no heed; a small houseplant seated next to the desk; a singular clock face by which he was telling the time; and a painting that broke the monotony of the beige wall that surrounded it.\n\nThe painting was what Heerema had been focusing on in the past few minutes in a vain attempt to stave off madness. It was a simple thing, a landscape commissioned by some self-important bureaucrat to some self-important artist, and it did little to soothe the anger that had been building inside. He had been sitting in this small waiting room for the better part of an hour, waiting for a meeting that had been scheduled for quite some time ago. His grand entrance, carefully planned to arrive just as the clock struck, had been stymied by the unassuming secretary sitting in front of him. \"Please, take a seat,\" he had said, sanctimonious and polite, \"the acting Reichskommissar will be with you shortly.\"\n\nFinally, a buzz broke the monotony of the ticking. With a feverish gaze, Heerema watched the secretary bring the phone to his ear. \"Yes?\" he asked. He gave a wordless nod, and hung up the telephone. \"You can go in,\" he said.\n\nStiffly, Heerema shot up, papers in hand, and walked past the secretary with his signature smile reasserting itself on his face. He threw open the doors, ready to sell his proposition as he had sold hundreds before.\n\nThe sight before him froze the smile on his face. It wasn't Leibbrandt. It wasn't even someone he recognized, just another sniveling man in an ill fitting suit. \"I'm sorry for the delay, sir, but the acting Reichskommissar will be unable to make it to the meeting today.\"\n\nHeerema turned on his heels, ramrod straight, and walked swiftly out of the building."

An administrative region far from Kyiv, where he could do no harm, and where his career would die. It was what the man deserved, after all."

He had resisted the intimidation of the SS, followed orders dispatched by Leibbrandt, and dispersed the resources he had control over to the UNA, thus empowering the newly recruited UNA collaborators. They would serve well, and take casualties that would have otherwise been suffered by German units.\n\nIt was a significant victory. The collaborator units were no longer paper tigers and would fight. Their losses would then keep them weak and dependent, and make their fighters loathe the insurgents of all flavors. Most importantly, however, was the loss of both face and strength on the part of the SS. They had been outmaneuvered, and everyone knew it.\n\nAt that thought, Leibbrandt added a smile to the nod, imagining the look on Ohlendorf's face. He also arranged a major promotion for Korsh.

Ukrainians who, though once collaborating with the German administration, had defected to the UNRA. Who realized that, despite their actions, they would never be accepted by their supposed countrymen, and who were always placed in the most dangerous situations. Who defected again, back to the Reich, and eagerly sold out their supposed comrades in order to avoid the hangman's noose.\n\nThe offer was of course accepted, as local security officials roused the garrison and swept through the bandit camps, killing all who were found and destroying large caches of equipment. It was a great victory, made all the greater when the officer in charge then turned the machine guns on the two-time traitors. They were useful, yes - but a traitor was a traitor always, and could not be trusted.\n\nThey had at least escaped the noose, to be sure. Ohlendorf agreed that a bullet was far better."

UPA bases hidden in the forests there had been exposed (even if that exposure had come from the local Poles who, though frequent collaborators, were still destable in every way) and completely destroyed.\n\nIt was also a victory, he knew, for interservice cooperation. The forests had been burned by the Luftwaffe, dropping napalm canisters in regimented fashion and the UPA fighters, left only one causeway out of the conflagration, had followed it out of desperation. The SS garrison had of course been waiting, and the slaughter had been near-total.\n\nThe UPA was badly hurt, and would not be undertaking operations anywhere near Volyn for some time. Ohlendorf knew that now was the moment to redirect resources to other insurgent regions, but not all. He knew well that the UPA was like a hydra.

A number of major bases, staging points, hidden cadres, and camps of other types had been identified, located, and utterly annihilated, with the end result of drastically impeding the Communist war effort in and around Charkow.\n\nIn his mind, Ohlendorf could see the ultimate result, if only similar victories could continue to be obtained. If only the security police could continue their patterns of efficiency and success. He could see the Communist menace completely crushed, their so-called 'People's War' destroyed once and for all. All attributable, of course, solely to his own efforts. His own leadership.\n\nYes, he could see that possible future, and he knew he would work to attain it.

The sallow light of the lantern highlighted their hollow cheeks with dramatic shadow. \"So, what have you got for us this week, Oleksiy?\" Asked one man, rubbing his hands together.\n\n\"Our benefactor has been kind,\" Said Oleksiy, a man with a greying beard and tired bones, laying out a set of books and scrap paper, \"The library in town got raided for carrying Ukrainian literature, so they dumped what they could in a field. Our good man Mykyta just scooped it up and brought it here.\"\n\n\"Spare the details! Who do we have?\"\n\nOleksiy began parsing through the books as the other slaves laid into them, although rather than read on their own they seemed to partner off. \"Let's see... Shevchenko, Stus... odd,\" Oleksiy paused, pulling a crumpled piece of paper from between the pages of one book, \"I don't think I've ever heard of this poet. Danylo Nosenko?\" The inked letters on the yellowed page were faded, the poem had to have been at least a decade old. The verses spoke of the imprisonment of Ukraine and of the author.\n\nOne man shrugged, \"Toss it in,\" They settled in and began to read to one another from the forbidden books of a dying culture which drew a breath with every line uttered.

I mean, I commend whatever superhuman of a recruiter got all of these folks here but, it'll be a bit rough,\" Said Dmytro.\n\n\"Eh, I wouldn't worry. The men are eager, even if they are green. They'll get into fighting shape. We were just like them at their age, weren't we?

Can't trust every damn cop who comes to us with a tip.\"\n\nThe brief conversation was interrupted by a rumbling engine. Anatoliy took his rifle in one hand, using the other to pull himself up slightly and get a good look out of the ditch.

The aging vehicle coughed and groaned as it halted. Whispered conversations in German took place within.\n\nOleksiy was out of the ditch before anyone could speak. In one swift movement his feet propelled him up and onto the road, his fingers pulled free the pin of a hand grenade and his arm sent it through the windshield.

The crumbling hulk of bricks held together by aging mortar and faith shone out like a beacon to Artem's tired eyes.\n\nIt did, however, look different since the last time he'd been there, about 14 hours ago. More colorful - there was some kind of mural scrawled across it. He took on a quicker pace to have a look, taking note of his neighbor assessing it as well. The frail old woman squinted behind her spectacles at the words on the wall, in simple blue and yellow paint. Artem read it aloud.\n\n\"UNRA. Fight for your voice, your home and your life,\" Said Artem. A bit wordy for graffiti, he figured.\n\n\"Hmph. Rabble-rousers, they're going to get us all killed,\" Said the woman.\n\nArtem gave a brief glare, noting a stack of leaflets nearby. He turned back to the horizon and saw a German armored car, its silhouette wreathed the flame, where once farm trucks had peacefully rolled. He heard the crack of rifles in the woods beyond the fields as a war raged in silence where once there were tweeting birds. He smelled the putrid scent of the chemical plant's emissions, where once was the smoke of hearths. He felt the cold bite his skin and sink its teeth into his bones, where once there was strength.

He gathered Bahaziy and all those in the administration that had silently pledged their loyalty to a free Ukraine. They were his chess pieces in a game of deception.\n\nIn the following days, Brest witnessed what seemed to be an administrative shuffle. Ohloblyn, with a subtle touch, began removing the Reich's pawns. Some were reassigned to insignificant roles. Others were conveniently transferred, their replacements always ready, their true loyalties hidden behind impassive masks. The German officials, swayed by Ohloblyn's charisma and the facade of bureaucratic efficiency, suspected little. And so, piece by piece, the city's administration was quietly overtaken, a silent coup unfolding under the Reich's unsuspecting watch.\n\nBrest lay in wait for the first signs of rebellion, and when the signal would come, supply lines would be blocked, communications severed, and backs would be stabbed.

As we both know, the occupation will soon crumble under the weight of happenings back in Germania, and until then, I believe it would be in our best interests to focus our resources on the forces of the fascists, namely the Nazis and the UPA, instead of each other.\"\n\nThe U-SSR delegate responds. \"Our organizations' interests, sir, are diametrically opposed, so no promises can be made. However, it would only be logical for the U-SSR to focus on the forces of fascism for now, seeing as they pose the serious threat.\" The backhanded insult is not lost on the UNRA delegate, though he has already gotten what he wants. As they walk away from the meeting, he whispers to his compatriot."

The assault was about to begin, but he would only be a far-away witness doing his duty. As soon as he got the order, Petro began what he was trained to do: he shouted his orders to his men, \"Open fire.\"\n\nPetro always found his unit's \"Ukrainian Orchestra,\" a motley mix of mortars, a peculiar thing, used by the Nazi beasts, taken by the Banderite thugs, and now under the control of his unit. He often wondered how many times these Orchestra pieces fired at communists before his unit captured them, he guessed probably at least a thousand rounds.\n\nAs the assault wore on, Petro could see the bloodbath unfolding. Communist fled from the structure, running out into the forests surrounding the encampment. Petro noticed a unit of the Reds held up in the last standing building, attempting to shoot their way out. With the situation at a standstill, Petro gave the order to level the building.\n\nThe tower was smashed from above, as if God himself crushed it with his fiery palms, killing soldiers from each side. By dusk, his unit withdrew, transporting as many of the wounded men in the back of his mortar truck.

Their property here will be void, if they choose to fight, we will pay for it in their blood.\"\n\nVengeful approval roared from the crowd.

The will of the Ukrainian people has always been thus; a democratic and free nation that is capable of standing strong against foreign imperialism and corruption. Memories of the past rarely clash with its uncountable cruelties, and the short lived state achieves more acclaim than it probably should.\n\nYet still, the dream persists. Provisions and articles are carefully crafted, laying out the basis for elections and rights. The framework for judicial, legislative, and executive bodies are provided, as well as their individual limitations and checks. Most importantly, separation of powers is laid out as indisputably necessary. No military or uniformed personnel will be permitted to hold office or run for elections.

It was maddening that the world had practically ended, and all Vasyl could do was survive it, and yet moments like these kept him calm, calmer at least. Looking to those around him, they weren't half as calm, the aura beyond the music was very clear that they could be rendered by a German raid at any instant.\n\nVasyl was nearly halfway through his song, and everyone could feel it. The mood shifted, the emotions changed. There wasn't any traffic outside. The chatter outside the apartment calmed disturbingly fast like the world was about to end, and in a sense, it was. The steps outside in the hall hadn't diminished, if anything they got less hectic and heavier. You could almost hear a pin drop if it weren't for the violin, and the Germans' knives being sharpened.\n\nVasyl took a breath. His friends took their handguns and machine guns out from under their coats or their suitcases and pointed them at the closed blinds or locked doors. Almost absentmindedly, Vasyl still played, and yet he got a bizarre feeling. He wouldn't be able to finish his song. He grew tense, primed, but he couldn't shake the feeling.

Turning it on, it came to a horrendous clamor of static. Turning the volume down, Ivan realized it was most likely to cover some illicit conversations. Tuning it to the Reichskommissariat's local channels, it came on exactly as expected.\n\n\"...All are to stay indoors in Vossenitz.

He had been making good progress on writing the manuscript lately, and had even sparked interest from the communist underground as far abroad as Italy. The intellectual environment and resources available in Rumanian-occupied Odesa were a far cry from that of Kyiv before the war, but Rozdolskyii had already dedicated four decades of his life to the study of Marx's work, and circumstance would not be sufficient to stop him.\n\nHe thought back to the times before 1941. How straightforward it had all seemed in those days; skipping classes at the Lviv Gymnasium to attend meetings of the illegal Drahomanov Circles, the days of the IRSD and demonstrations against the barbarity of the Great War, the Communist Party of Western Ukraine and the struggle against the Polish authorities - the sense of utter clarity in purpose and infinite revolutionary potential was intoxicating. The reunion of Western Ukraine with the East in 1939 had felt like a crescendo: the mission the KPZU dedicated its existence to achieved at last. How tragic it was that only two years later the Germans would invade, and plunge Ukraine into two decades of unrelenting horror.\n\nStill, though, he kept the fire in his heart. Someday, all humanity would be free. Free from capitalism, free from the nation-state, free from politics, free from capital, wage labor, monetary exchange - all the imposed burdens of bourgeois civilization. This would not be achieved in his lifetime, or perhaps many future lifetimes; but Rozdolskyi felt that he, the Communist Party, and Ukraine in general had, however small or short-lived, some role to play in getting there.\n\nThree knocks on the front door and the sound of someone running away snapped Rozdolskyii out of his reminiscing. He went to the door to find a small, twisted piece of paper shoved under it with a hastily-scrawled message and a hand-drawn red-blue-yellow flag identifying it as legitimate: ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON KOCH SUCCESSFUL - REICHSKOMMISSARIAT IN CHAOS - ARMED STRUGGLE TO RESUME - PARTY ORGANIZATION TO RECONVENE AT DESIGNATED MEETING PLACE.\n\nThe old revolutionary smiled. He would receive one last chance to leave his mark on history."

First, it was the Tsar and the whites, then the counter-revolutionaries, and in the end, the Germans. However, all of my efforts, as those of thousands and thousands of others, went in vain. Ukraine lies in ruins, and there's no one to clean them up and rebuild our country to the glorious days of the past, to the days of the Union. The young generation, though continuing the fight for the sacred ideals our nation once stood for, among many other brotherly nations, is untested and idealistic - they're doomed to fail, they don't stand a chance in the face of the German occupiers. So I ask, beg you while it's not late - flee Ukraine. There is no hope of ever breaking our chains. I can sense the war coming, the great war we've not seen since the 40s; and while we still have our fragile peace, you should run away from this place. Run away to Turkey - it's not that far away from here, and then further abroad. Ukraine may be lost, but not the world.\n\nI wish you good luck, wherever you may be, and remember that I love you. Yours, Dmytro Ambrosiv.\"\n\nAfter the partisan finished his letter, he felt relief - the only thing he still had to do was done. He may now rest peacefully. He went to sleep - and never woke up.

Both times, Klochurak had stood on the front lines, as Prime Minister of the Hutsul Republic and then two decades later led the armies of the mayfly state of Carpatho-Ukraine. Both times the light of Ukrainian freedom was stamped out by Hungarian boots, both times Klochurak had failed his people.\n\nWhen the UPA courier had arrived at his farmhouse door asking to speak to the leader of the Carpathian resistance, Klochurak almost laughed in his face. What resistance? A few old men sharing a bottle of vodka at Christmas and singing songs of times long gone. No, there would be no uprising here, the dream of Carpatho-Ukraine was long gone. And yet, perhaps, Ukraine was not lost. Maybe the partisans in the east could succeed where he had failed. There were still a few stockpiles of guns hidden away in the dirt, and surely he had enough sway to gather some volunteers.\n\nAs he approached the eastern border, the mountain shadows behind him, the old man sat down to make camp, and began to ponder his next destination.

They are aware of our needs, and are willing to supply us with weapons and equipment for a substantial price.\n\nThese are businessmen who have minimal sympathy for our goals. They can and will charge as much as they know we can pay, not just for equipment, but also for the movement across national borders. That it is within Pakt territory will result in additional fees. Nonetheless, I can vouch that the equipment sold will fill our needs, and the sellers are reliable. However, this will incur a not-insignificant expense.\n\nI will leave the choice to pursue acquisitions to your discretion. I will be standing by in the event that orders are to be put in.

Klyachkivsky's power-sharing and eventual seizure of the organization's leadership had left a bad taste in Shukhevych's mouth, who had assumed that he would become leader, given his years of service and close relationship with Bandera.\n\nKlyachkivsky pondered the tumultuous time of the previous decade. Interfactional disputes in his mind threatened the army and needed to be cleansed. Shukhevych had, of course, disagreed and was more open to a diverse set of views. The bungling of this situation that caused more conflict within the UPA, in Shukhevych's mind - had only furthered the rift between them.\n\nIt was not the time to dwell on the past, though.

Traitors?\n\nHis answer was in the form of a leaflet, handed to him by Dmytro. \"We found several boxes filled with these, hidden well. We immediately confiscated them, and are searching for more as we speak.\"\n\nKlyachkivsky's face hardened, and disgust filled him as he read the leaflet. A leaflet that was explicitly anti-Banderite, encouraged his overthrow, and championed liberty, democracy, and freedom. He crumpled the leaflet in his palm, as he faced his subordinates, his voice cold.\n\n\"How severely have we been compromised?\" He demanded slowly. \"Communists? Republicans? Do we have a lead?\"\n\n\"Yes, we do - to a degree,\" Stepan said slowly. \"My Vozhd... these were found in an armory. In a location where the other groups have not been spotted. Loathe as I am to admit it... this isn't being disseminated by an outside force. This is coming from within the UPA.\"\n\nKlyachkivsky froze in place at that, as possibilities ran through his mind; questions with disturbing answers filling his thoughts. Such treason from within? It couldn't be - not like this. Yet...\n\nHe looked at both men, and knew that they would not intentionally mislead him - they knew the consequences for that. However, this was a very bad sign. And it meant that he had many enemies - ones with resources and influence. Perhaps they were already preparing to move against him.

He could ascertain some basics, but trying to chart a path through a guaranteed economic crisis and reconstruction? That wasn't even close to his role.

Piasetsky was clearly unhappy with where he was, and knew when he was being sidelined. Hard to come to any other conclusion when cronies and sycophants received promotions from Klyachkivsky and not hardworking men like him.\n\nStetsko had no intention of making the same mistake as Klyachkivsky, and was not going to ignore the opportunity it presented.

His discomfort only lasted a few seconds, before he laughed. \"This is why I like you, Lev. But let's be serious now, shall we.\"\n\nRebet also chuckled, but he sounded a bit stilted.

Bräutigam and Leibbrandt may preach reform and practice their base politicking, but they never had to put a bullet in a communist once in their lives. As his men continued to look at him expectedly, Ohlendorf rose to deliver his verdict:\n\n\"We are already stretched to the brink for men. Tell the garrisons to hold out until we can reinforce their positions, but...\" Ohlendorf tapped Kiew's spot on the map as if it were a hidden clause \"...our attention must be focused on the core, lest it succumb to opportunistic outbursts of revolution. If we lose that, we will lose our most critical administrative base, leaving our men to be picked off like flies.\"\n\nThe faces among the officers were mixed. Some could only mourn the inevitable losses their detachments would suffer. Some were just relieved to have the hard choice made for them. But a lingering question remained. \"What now?\"\n\n\"Consolidate our control over the center. If anyone dares to make a move in Kiew, put them into the dirt. Twenty years of work has gone into maintaining our Lebensraum; if it fell, the shame will follow us all and our families into the grave even if we survived.\""

Despite our best efforts, it has not been re-established, with only a few frenzied telegrams coming from various Heer garrisons stationed on the border with the General Government being delivered to Kiew. The Generalkommissar of the region has fled. His whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\nWhat we do know is fairly basic; various UPA bandit units have seized villages in the northwest and proclaimed a \"Ukrainian State\". This declaration, which was broadcast on hijacked radio to much of Ukraine was mostly a re-iteration of the Banderite version from 1941, with a few references to the tyranny of Germany and the looming threat of Bolshevism. These new rebels have been exceptionally brutal to the scattered settlements and depleted Heer garrison they have come across, slaughtering hundreds and sending thousands fleeing west through the embattled General Government to a vain hope of safety in Germany, or east towards us and an uncertain future.\n\nBandit military units seem to be made up of hardened guerrillas who recently defected to Schuma. They lack major ordinances but do contain enough manpower to pose a significant threat to our operations in the west. Defense operations by more organized Heer units have yielded some successes in scattering probing attacks directly on our border, but by and large, there has been no stopping the advance.\n\nLocal opinion on the matter seems to be mixed. Bolshevik presence in the area has always been sparse, but it is large enough to provide something of a fifth column to the Banderites. Locals have never exactly taken kindly to the bandits and have reacted by and large with apathy towards the recent uprising. What few popular actions the Banderites have taken have been mere re-distributions of land."

The police could not hold them for long, even when they so hastily resorted to gunning down the rebels and rioters that preceded the well armed UPA troops emerging from the woodwork, furious and determined.\n\nThe cities became battlegrounds, and morale broke under the pressure in an instant. Many of the Ukrainian police could not bear to fight their brothers, laying down arms and joining the nationalist revolutionaries. Those that could retreated in terror or died on the pavement.\n\nAs refugees fled the horrors and messengers crawled back home, command was able to piece together a sitrep.

Unfortunately for them, the military was occupied, and they got nothing but the dregs even as the fires rose higher in the west. Instead, troop convoys traveled with stilted haste toward Volhynia.\n\nWhat had once been an intelligence black hole was now the undisputed territory of the UPA, whose troops were emerging to meet the growing response. Sources told that they had pushed from Volhynia to Shitomir, painting the gray lands with flame and blood. Before long, the rioting populace was under their control and communication lines had gone silent, abruptly ending a death rattle of urgent cries for help that could not adequately be answered. In the burning cities and ichor-soaked fields, battle lines were forming. From the lowliest soldier digging into the mud to the generals scanning reports, they all knew this was turning from an insurgency to civil war.\n\nRefugees crossed these lines, despite the scorched fields and the cracked roads, patrolled by hateful soldiers or roadblocked by bitter steel and sandbag walls. The growing volume and frequency of gunfire did little to deter them, Ukrainian or German. Neither army was making much distinction in their drive to form a frontline before the situation could escalate.\n\nThe most determined, and shaken, emigrants were Germans, who reported only further violence in their tales of the fall of Hegewald colony to the UPA. They painted a grim picture of the fate of the colony in both haunted tales of violence, and the dead and mutilated they brought with them.

The administrators had been hanged or shot, the police had joined the ranks of the UPA or the dead, and the military had begun to scramble to meet a liberated Ukraine's expanding borders. Word spread in the mouths of fleeing refugees, and with it spread further chaos as dozens of towns burst into the same level of vicious infighting that Volhynia had. The beleaguered collaborationists were stretching thinner and thinner as the UPA advanced on Shitomir, and at that point they could not resist. The battle was brief and bloody, revenge exacted on the defenders by rifle or blade, and the rioters liberated or the same.\n\nA particularly bold advance had been made into Hegewald colony, the UPA wasted no time doing what they deemed necessary and just to the German settlers. All became targets when the irregulars fell upon the land, and few who didn't flee in time remained alive. Those that escaped would stagger with their wounded back to government-controlled territory and tell their tales, of terror in fields that were now empty and scorched. The region, save for the patrols, was as quiet as the grave it was.\n\nThe same could not be said of where UPA territory ended. Fortifications were dug and barricades raised as on the horizon could be seen the reaction of the government, sending in what few men they could spare from the chaotic mess the rest of the country had become.

The Republican forces had already mobilized and seized Vinnytsia after some brief fighting, leaving the self-declared Republic with a fairly large chunk of territory and support.\n\nLeibbrandt considered the situation the Reichskommissariat was in now - it was bad, and resolution would demand swift and decisive measures on his part. The fact was, that across Ukraine, they had lost significant authority. Beyond most of the larger cities and rural settler regions, they might as well have no presence.\n\nA problematic situation, but the cities were the most important.

Several things had happened in quick succession following their unveiling to the nation.\n\nThey had quickly gained the support of Ohloblyn, as well as fully seized Vinnytsia after some brief skirmishes. In a matter of days they'd established themselves as firm opponents to the false government, gained momentum politically and publicly, and were well-positioned for the war to come.\n\nThis was all the easy part.\n\nYuriy knew very well that things were not fully in their favor. While the Germans had lost authority across vast swathes of Ukraine, they still held many of the cities, as well as the German settler-populated rural regions. They were certainly weakened, but they were definitely not helpless or incapable of responding.\n\nMuch of what happened next depended on how well the Nazis were able to organize themselves.

We are under attack, and facing multiple coordinated partisan uprisings across Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Repeat, we are under attack and require immediate support.\"\n\nAnd still there was nothing.\n\nNo one knew what was going on in Germania now. The entire Pakt appeared to have exploded at the same time. From Ostland to even Poland, the entirety of Eastern Europe seemed to be engulfed in violence and chaos, of which Germany itself was not immune to. And still he continued trying to raise Germany for what seemed like hours.\n\nEach time was met with static or silence.\n\nHe continued trying, repeating the single message until his voice became dry; the single plea for support, while privately wondering what they would do if no help came - as seemed more likely with each passing second. Would they be able to put down this uprising? Did these insurgents truly pose a threat?\n\nCertainly not, but he was concerned about how much damage they would inflict before they were put down. Eventually, he was forced to accept the cold, unforgiving truth. No one was coming to save them. Germany was silent."

Hoping they would not be found as those screams ceased, one by one. Seeing the devastation around them that morning, they gathered what they could and left with haste.\n\nBut the forests had no succor to give. Safer than the roads, perhaps, especially after they saw what the partisans did to those they captured upon it, but no have, indeed. At first they had thought the swaying figures to be animals - and then they drew closer, and the horrible truth was revealed.\n\nThe father recognized one of them - a man from the village, who clearly had the same intention as they. He had been gutted before being strung up from the tree, as. As had his wife and children, though more tortures had been practiced upon them. The family looked closely, said nothing, and trudged on, eschewing food or sleep in pursuit of progress towards safety.\n\nEventually, after several days and many more horrific sights of bandit retribution, the city appeared on the horizon, and when they saw the Stahlhelms of the checkpoint sentries, every member of the family broke into tears of relief.\n\nKiew was freedom, for now.

Not when there was a clear solution to the partisan threat that no one was proposing.\n\n\"There is a practical solution here,\" he finally said when there was a lull in the conversation. He intended to be brief and present it with as little bias as he could muster. He disliked he had to coach his suggestions in such a way, but both Leibbrandt and Bräutigam would view any suggestion that relied on another as a power play. \"We redeploy my forces from the east to the north.\"\n\nAs he'd expected, that got the attention. \"And why would your men make a difference?\" Bräutigam asked. Ohlendorf resisted the urge to scowl, not sure if the man was being intentionally dense or not.\n\n\"Because unlike our regular divisions, my men have experience with anti-partisan warfare - successfully at that,\" he answered. \"The partisans can fight in the east forever, and it wouldn't matter. Kiew is their prize; it is a symbol, and so long as we hold it, they cannot claim legitimacy.\"\n\nLeibbrandt considered it for a moment, then nodded. \"I agree. Disrupting any efforts to liberate, or even threaten, the capital is a better usage of our limited forces.\"\n\nOhlendorf gave the Acting Reichskommissar a short, thankful nod, glad that he could see some reason. \"That will be what we do,\" Leibbrandt declared. \"Ohlendorf, mobilize your men and ensure that these partisans cannot threaten the capital. Let them burn themselves out in the east.\"\n\nOhlendorf nodded sharply. \"It will be done.\""

The work of suppressing the subhuman was endless and taxing, especially when having to deal with the broken pluralism of the Security Council. Though his prussian sense of duty would never allow for a proper vacation, a visit with the Gauleiter in Gotenland was welcome, and so Ohlendorf eagerly accepted the task.\n\nUnfortunately for Ohlendorf, this cordial talk had soon turned into little more than another inspection. Maierhofer, desperate to return confidence to his region, wasted no time in showing Ohlendorf all kinds of preparations. To some extent, such \"pleasantries\" were a part of diplomacy. But when Germany's fate was on the line, Ohlendorf hardly had patience.\n\nThings became worse once Ohlendorf began taking the inspection seriously. The military was split between several different commands, leaving soldiers on the ground confused. The lines of fortifications would crumble once a single weak point was found. Maierhofer, unwilling to commit to Ukraine, was going to waste his last resources on trifles.\n\nAs the truck carrying the Gauleiter and Ohlendorf pulled into the NSDAP Taurien headquarters, Ohlendorf felt he had to voice what this tour had truly made him think. \"I will be blunt with you, Herr Maierhofer, because I have to be. All of these preparations are just bluster in the long run - they can only survive as long as our administration remains in control. Your gau cannot survive an onslaught from the Ukrainians. All these men and guns would be better spent on the front lines.\""

The final agreement was long and a little tedious - Gotenland was, unsurprisingly, anxious about every detail - leaving a surprisingly thick stack of pages to examine.\n\nDespite all the detail, the core was summarized in the first line: \"For the purpose of securing the territory of the Reich, the Gau of Gotenland will provide a shipment of supplies, primarily military in nature, to be utilized by the Reichskommissariat Ukraine and its Wehrmacht forces as they see fit.\"\n\nAnd then, it continued into an itemized list of charges: money, some guns, minor support across the board. It wasn't truly what Ohlendorf had come here for - if he had his way, Gotenland would be sending its entire army rather than trying its own separate defense. Yet the conversations with Maierhofer made it clear they weren't willing to go further. These gifts would be about as much as Ukraine could hope for."

No deal.\n\nIt was ridiculous. Ohlendorf did not think of himself as quick to anger, but to leave without even a gun from the Gotenland government made it clear that they had no respect for their past, let alone any aptitude for planning. Gotenland was ultimately an appendage of the Ukrainian project, one designed and enforced by RKU planners. Now, that Crimean set was willing to bet everything on their own defense, before their forces had even seen combat.

The divisions appear to be experiencing... problems.\"\n\n\"Precisely, Reichskommissar,\" Conrady said - and Ohlendorf didn't fail to note that the man was intentionally avoiding calling him 'Acting' in any capacity. \"What the men need-\"\n\n\"What the men need is better training, equipment, and leadership,\" Ohlendorf interrupted, his voice even as the frustration was close to boiling over. \"The issue with the divisions is not one of manpower, Commander, which I would expect you to know. Morale is non-existent; service is seen as a punishment. Nothing you propose addresses the action problems we face!.\"\n\nConrady stiffened, glaring at Ohlendorf. \"I know well the state of our military, Ohlendorf. And I know what must be done. The east cannot be lost, and this allows us to hold it.\"\n\n\"While your concerns are noted, Ohlendorf, I agree with the Commander,\" Leibbrandt finally said. \"We need divisions and men in the field.

He was not one to strong-arm.\n\nBut it had to be done. A nation was a complex thing, but a party was simpler, a collection of humans who had the same foibles as all of humankind. Even the strongest Aryan still felt the pull of the group, moving them towards whatever positions seemed most defensible. Even Rosenberg, in weaker moments, began to hesitate and allow himself to be convinced by the pull of others- perhaps that is what allowed the SS and so many other plotters to take him down.\n\nLeibbrandt had tried to find unity, but talking had proven ineffective. Bräutigam and Ohlendorf were not interested in following orders - at the end of the day, they were biased by their own self-interest. Common ground was not worth finding with a group that would not even support their own Reichskommissar when Ukraine itself was collapsing.

The vicious, controlled Ohlendorf won political battles, improved the economy, and enforced Nazi ideology with fire and bullet. The compromised, watered-down Ohlendorf watched Ukraine burn.

 UKR_UCW_RK.22.desc: "The German soldiers were covered in blood, sweat, mud, and scars, but Franz had no intention of letting the hell that Ukraine had become best them.\n\nThe uprising had initially been nothing but chaos as soldiers were assassinated, and partisans attacked from alleys and forests. Fires had been set, and Zhdanovs thrown as the terrorists had tried to burn whatever they couldn't kill. The streets had been filled with corpses, and the sounds of gunfire as rain had poured down, turning the streets into muddy misery.\n\nYet against the odds, they had stopped the initial attack. His face scarred from a Zhdanov, and caked in dirt, Franz was not deterred, but eager for payback. Their attempts to kill him had failed, and he'd successfully regrouped his forces - and set them against where the terrorists were hiding.\n\nBe it overconfidence or simple incompetence, the Ukrainians hadn't truly bothered to hide their camp, which they had retreated to after their initial failed attack. Some of his men told him to hold in place, to wait for support or reinforcements, which Franz had ignored. He knew that no help was coming anytime soon, and doubted men could be spared regardless - so they had to make do with what they had.\n\nThe Germans descended on the partisan camp, breaking the meager defenses with an ease even Franz was surprised by. Their uniforms solided, ripped, and bearing the markings of battle, they dismantled the camp, and subdued what Ukrainians hadn't been killed in the initial assault. Leaders and officers were taken away to be interrogated, while the remaining soldiers summarily executed.\n\nAs more rain fell, Franz was sure more attacks would come - but the advantage the partisans had enjoyed was lost. Now they would be prepared. Now, the Reichskommissariat would respond."

The administration had demanded it, and so the attempt would be made. But this was Ukraine, and all knew very well what that meant.\n\nThe meeting began, agendas were set, and the first roadblocks were hit. All agreed that the Council offered the best venue for unity, and indeed slow progress was made on the articles desired, but then questions were raised about how the forum would work - and so began, identified by those members with long experience in Ukrainian dysfunction - the undoing.\n\nOne member raised the question of authority. Was the Council's mandate absolute, or was there some other power? This resulted in two opposing proclamations by other members, who were soon supported by factions around them. Arguments subsequently grew, and before long the 'debate' occupied all remaining time, with nothing of note being accomplished.\n\nAs they left, those with wagers either rejoiced in profit or suffered in loss, their fears being well-founded. They would of course try again. But then the wagers would be larger."

Crowds guarded by machine guns were here today to bear witness to the end of a story, its moral being as clear as the daylight they basked in - this is what happens to rebels.\n\nIn a front-row view of the gallows stood Bräutigam. This was a spectacle he wished to avoid but there was going to be no reprieve from it, just like there would be no reprieve for the men of the UNRA. The trials, if such a term could even be used to describe them, handed out death sentence after death sentence, this affair was the capstone.\n\nBräutigam listened to the mayor of Kiew begin a monologue condemning the UNRA as traitors who sought to destroy the unity that Germany created, he wondered if Liebbrandt wrote the speech for him. An SS hangman cut him off by calling up the first partisan to the gallows: Yuriy Horlis.\n\nOnce a heroic freedom fighter who inspired hope for many, the man in chains cut a figure that was far removed from the tales told about him. He limped his way to the noose, surrendering himself to the rope to see him free. The rest of the leadership followed, Bräutigam tried to disconnect himself from the proceedings but was foiled by one man.\n\nOhloblyn. He glanced at Bräutigam as he marched to his death, his eyes begged him to speak up. Bräutigam's mouth opened - but not a sound was made, it was as if his tongue refused to allow him to make such a fatal mistake. If he were to speak, his rivals would set upon him like hounds. No, now was not the time.\n\nOhloblyn continued to the gallows as he realized there would be no reprieve for him, acquiescing to his rope necklace with the rest of his ilk.

 UKR_UCW_capitulation.2.desc: "We received word today that Klyachkivsky's remaining men have been taken into custody, this marks the de facto death of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. On some level, it is a tragedy for the Ukrainian race, to see its fiercest warriors cut down while trying to pursue that same goal of independence that I have fought for so long. On the face of it, our struggles were very similar.\n\nBut they were far too rash in achieving their goals, they were rabid dogs lashing out at their companions, and just like any other sick animal, they needed to be put down. It is sad that they failed to see the endless possibilities of what we could achieve together. Alas, it does not bear further contemplation, hopefully, it teaches Ukrainians what happens if they forsake us.\n\nKlyachkivsky, Shukhevych, Stetsko, and the rest of the leadership that led their men to attempt to reach for an unattainable folly will be executed, they are all too dangerous and unpredictable to be kept alive. I'll need to remind Ohlendorf to make the affair as quick and quiet as possible. Those loyal Ukrainians among our ranks hold respect for those delusional romantics, no need to alienate our collaborators by turning the half-mad into martyrs.\n\nAs a show of our magnanimity, we will spare those low-ranking members who have not been indoctrinated enough by the false prophet Bandera. We should be able to put them to work for our own needs soon enough. Melnyk's OUN is in dire need of new blood after all, let us just hope this establishes his faction as the dominant one for good.\n\nWork calls me once more, I pray for the day when there are no more roadblocks to a stable land where these people can be happy.

The remaining members of the U-SSR, their faces etched with defiance, stood before him, their fate sealed within the clutches of the fascist regime. They, who were once fierce propagandists who could rally men with their impassioned words, now stood silenced, their voices gagged and their fate sealed. It was a cruel irony that those who had once ignited the flames of rebellion were now reduced to mere pawns in the Reich's calculated game.\n\nYet a moment of opportunity emerged as the noose tightened around Oleksander Shumskyi's neck. His gag slipped, liberating his voice for a fleeting instant. Shumskyi unleashed his inner defiance in that brief respite from oppression, his words ringing with righteous anger. \"You architects of tyranny and oppression, your reign will crumble, and the masses will hang you as you have hanged us!\" he screamed, tears streaming as he shuffled the gag down his chin. \"Long live the resistance of the proletariat and the working class, the proud people of Ukraine!\"\n\nPandemonium erupted within the courtroom, guards scrambling to suppress Shumskyi's impassioned outburst. Amidst the chaos, Ohlendorf, with calculated efficiency, calmly issued a directive to the guards. \"Ensure the gag is properly tied next time,\" he said, his tone devoid of emotion or concern for the defiant proclamation that had momentarily pierced the suffocating atmosphere."

Its fall would mean an end to nationalist resistance, so they were expecting very hard resistance. The best men were assembled, the strongest howitzers were brought; everything was prepared for the final battle in this war.\n\nHowever, to their surprise, all UPA soldiers had abandoned their positions, and no storm was needed. At first, it seemed like a trap, but as sections of the compound were cleared one by one, no resistance was met. The place was in disarray - guns scattered across the floor, documents strewn about, and so on - just like an abandoned military base should look, thought the soldiers and officers. The enemy fighters had truly left without a fight.\n\nAfter some time, a small group of UNRA stormtroopers finally reached the deepest chamber of the compound. On the count of three, they busted through the door - Shukhevych attempted to fire upon them was struck down with a bullet wound to the chest. His son lunged towards the men in blind rage only to receive a rifle butt for his troubles as they marched towards the grand Vozhd. Klyachkivsky was sitting on a chair nearby, with a gun to his temple and his right hand shaking. Stetsko wasn't there; he must've fled with the others, but the soldiers didn't care. They wanted to get out of that place as soon as possible. Klyachkivsky was taken away, alongside Shukhevych and his son, and after some time, all entries to the compound were sealed."

 UKR_UCW_capitulation.6.desc: "Shumsky, along with five UNRA soldiers guarding him, walked out of the theater building in Rostow, which had miraculously survived through German occupation and the civil war. Just moments ago, he had signed a formal act of unconditional surrender of the communist forces, and the men now escorting him were witnesses to this. According to the document, all units must cease their operations until disarmament, and Shumsky, along with the most important figures in the Soviet resistance, was allowed to leave Ukraine and move to another neutral country.\n\nHe didn't try to comfort himself with the thought that it wasn't his fault; he had no interest in fooling himself. He felt responsible for the failure of the communist ideal and for letting down all the people who had worked so hard for the re-establishment of Soviet Ukraine. The workers and peasants of Ukraine would never truly be free. The fight was lost this time. The dreams of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Bukharin would never be realized. His dream would never be realized.\n\nStill, Shumskyi thought, it wasn't all that bad - after all, it wasn't the Wehrmacht that extinguished the communist fire, but the somewhat reasonable Horlis and his UNRA. Deep in his soul, he knew that Horlis wasn't a bad man; he just had other ideas, and the fact that the leader of the democratic resistance agreed to a treaty rather than outright destroying the Soviet partisans was already worthy of respect. It was an honest fight - and a loss in such a fight is a dignified loss.\n\nDuring his inner monologue, Shumskyi and the soldiers passed a flagpole near the theater, and he saw the flag of the Ukrainian SSR being taken down. His only reaction was a deep sigh."

They spent their last moments roasting on a pyre, singing a choking song, sucking onto the dirt in a pool of crimson or facing a line of rifles. Each method was soundtracked to a medley of once-forgotten Ukrainian music, a celebration for reclaiming what was theirs.\n\nShukhevych today was one of the countless revelers, taking his rifle to a righteous slaughter with his comrades as part of a firing squad. Each one of the German dogs faced him, he carefully picked his target. A Melnykite lackey whose luxury came from the oppression of his very own people. He readied his rifle at the dog's head before a call to fire was given, painting the wall behind him with grey matter.\n\nHe and the rest of his vermin collapsed onto the earth, soon to be taken away and burnt. Shukhevych took a break from the revels, one that was interrupted when an adjutant brought him a special prize, Deputy Reichskommissar Georg Leibbrandt. The crestfallen academic kneeled before him, bloody and broken. He dismissed his aide before he got lost in thought.\n\nOnce, he was in the same position as the man he had just killed. In another life, he could have stayed with the 201st Schutzmannschaft Battalion, maybe he would have been one of the Ukrainians who stood up against the wall. Do the others still know of that past? His thoughts were interrupted by the babbling of a bureaucrat.\n\n\"You know, we have a lot in common. Granted, I would have gone about independence differently but there are many in Germany like me.

Klyachkivsky's gaze sharpened, his steps quickening towards the fallen leader. Slumped and lifeless, Shumskyi lay-a casualty of a sniper's bullet. Flames of fury surged within Klyachkivsky, a tempestuous storm raging beneath his stoic exterior as he stared upon Shumskyi's body, a testament to their bitter rivalry. \"Rostow's town square,\" he commanded, his voice dripping with chilling resolve. \"An example must be made.\"\n\nThe soldiers exchanged silent glances, fully aware of the formidable force of their commander's anger.

Perhaps there were a few moments where he slipped just below the surface of sleep, experiencing brief dreams of the last few days. The fall of his garrison. The retreat order, surely part of a mass surrender. The prison he'd been guarding in flames. His failure to lead his men, instead fleeing when the first statue of Hitler fell to a vengeful bombardment. His mad fly into the forests toward a far away border that he wasn't even sure existed anymore.\n\nAnd now the logical conclusion. Hushed whispers in the brush, behind the cover of the ancient forest. It was as if he was surrounded by angry ghosts. His mind scrambled for any kind of option, as he was no exorcist.

Occasionally, other men in green would throw things at them. Horse excrement? Bags of urine? Vomit? Only God knew. Where were those men going? What was causing that foul scent?

The town had been liberated - German garrisons far from their home could put up little fight.\n\nToday, one could see the scars of that battle clear as day - burnt homes, covered bodies, and the ruins of the local fountain left broken in half by tank fire. Yet just next to that rubble was a burning pile of objects, surrounded by soldiers and local Ukrainians. As Halyna rushed to see what it was, she recognized a wooden swastika, installed by the Nazis in the center of town. Already blackened, one arm crumbled and fell.\n\nHow warm this fire feels, Halyna thought to herself. How lucky I am to be alive today."

 UKR_UCW_characters.7.desc: "The city was small, but from the moment Bohdan had wandered into it, he'd instantly felt a difference. For one, there were no Germans here, and he struggled to recall a time when that had not been the case. Without their presence, everything seemed different. It was lively and hopeful; emotions that had been alien to him for so long.\n\nHe'd been so used to being in the background; an invisible person on the fringes of society; keeping himself small to avoid the Germans from paying attention - not that they looked for people who looked like him; for Ukraininans were subhuman in their eyes. Here... it hadn't been the same. One of the residents, a middle-aged Ukrainian woman, had spotted him in dirty clothes and missing a few meals, and quickly brought him into the small camp for refugees.\n\nHe wasn't the only one to wander in. There were other stragglers who'd found their way, and while there wasn't a lot, all of them got some fresh clothes, food, water, and small comforts he'd previously had to scrounge for. The soldiers watched them closely, but there was surprisingly little suspicion.\n\nIt was too much for him to deal with after a certain point. Bohdan knew that all of this was temporary. The Germans were going to return, and he couldn't let himself believe things would change. To do so was dangerous, even if he wished he could embrace this community who had taken him in without question.\n\nHe didn't deserve it; it should be for someone who truly needed it. He could survive on his own; he could endure when the jackboot came crashing back down. Other people deserved the hope. Those who could truly believe it.\n\nIn the middle of the night he snuck out of the city, and back into the woods. He did not look back, for if he did, he might have changed his mind."

More sounds reached her ears, ones of a city that she instinctively knew was Amsterdam. She slowly became aware that she was floating down one of the canals, but why, she did not know.\n\nAnd she could not move.\n\nAt first she was not alarmed, sedated and comforted by both the sun and water, the latter of which felt like a protective cocoon as she floated. Above her, she saw the homes and buildings of her childhood home; she saw people walking down the streets, over bridges, smiling; laughing, but seemingly unable to see her floating by.\n\nShe tried to call out to them, but her mouth refused to obey.\n\nThe water began turning colder, and the bright sun became obscured by clouds. The comforting warmth faded, and rain took its place. The familiar sounds of the city became fainter, and were replaced by the sounds of the Ukrainian wilderness, interspersed with distant gunshots. She saw a glimpse of Amsterdam behind her, becoming smaller and smaller as she was swept out into the North Sea.\n\nShe screamed for someone to help, to save her from where she was being dragged - and to her surprise, she was finally able to.\n\nAntonia shot up in her bed, panting heavily as the vestiges of the dream faded, and she awoke in the small, cramped, and cold room which was now their home. An apartment with paint chipped off the walls, uneven floors, and a wet stench that didn't seem to go away. Their new home. She laid back down, her eyes wet as she struggled to return to sleep."

For the Nosenkos, they paid that cost in foodstuffs and supplies. The Nosenkos had relied on a broken and exploitative economy, but in the harsh center of war, there was no economy. They simply had to fend for themselves.\n\nAnd so, in the quiet dark at the end of the growing season, the two sat around the table and marked off rations, quietly considering what they had left. For hours, they methodically marked off what they'd gathered this season, and for how long it would need to last them.\n\nThen, an odd comment came from Danylo, as a slip of the tongue. \"I hope this is all worth it.\"\n\nHalyna looked up from her work, indignant. \"You must know it is.\"\n\nDanylo shook his head. \"I do not. I have hope, but I know nothing.\"\n\nHalyna put her notes down and turned to Danylo, her eyes burning with an intensity that cut through the darkness. \"If we die tomorrow, it still will have been worth it.\"\n\nThe room was silent for a moment.\n\n\"I don't want you to die.\""

A sharp wind cut through even coats, and muck and mud clung to boots and clothes. Bohdan observed the soldier from within these woods, watching as he stumbled along the torn-up road.\n\nHe didn't know where the soldier had come from, but it was unmistakably a German. Their uniforms were easy to identify, even though it was torn, and grime that covered it. The man was in poor shape; his movements were sluggish, his feet dragged, and his back slouched. He held one arm gingerly, with no weapon to be seen.\n\nThe soldier was young, thin, small, and with sandy hair. Maybe a boy from the invading settlements; maybe a conscript from Germany itself. It didn't matter. Bohdan watched silently, his own rifle in hand. He heard the voice of his commander, as clear as the day before his first battle.\n\n\"When the enemy is in your sights, you will not hesitate. You will kill them, unless you want them to do the same to us.\"\n\nThere was only one fate for Germans. He mechanically aimed, inhaled, and fired.\n\nThe soldier fell to the ground with a scream, writhing in agony from the shot to the back. Another shot rang out, and the soldier went still. Bohdan only lowered the rifle once he was sure the man was dead. He remembered how he had felt when he'd killed his first German. Elation, pride, satisfaction.\n\nHe felt none of that now, only a cold dispassion. One more German was dead, but there were thousands remaining. A drop in the bucket, but every drop counted. He stripped the body of what little it had, and once more vanished into the woods."

Nor where home even was for them anymore. Where they had lived in Ukraine, Or where she had been happy in the Netherlands. Her smile faltered only slightly, as she kept her voice light.\n\n\"When all is well, which will be soon,\" she promised. \"And when it is, I'm going to take you to a beautiful place. Do you know Holland?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Where you grew up?\"\n\nShe smiled fondly. \"Yes. A beautiful place, with green landscapes, clear streams, clean cities. I can't wait for you to see it yourself,\" she leaned in a bit closer, as if sharing a secret. \"Your father won't admit it, but between us, I think he'd want to visit it too.\"\n\nHe smiled at that, as if he too wanted to go to a land without trouble, but there was something in the smile that Antonia knew was forced.

It sounded ludicrous to him - nothing seemed more mundane than the freshly harvested field, an empty expanse that spread in every direction.\n\nYet it was capturing something for him. Here he could see nothing, and yet everything - his home, his fields, and even in the far distance his town. Thinking further, it struck Danylo as a great metaphor - was this not what Ukraine had become? A great field, harvested into oblivion?\n\nHe stopped himself. This field was not destroyed - certainly, years of German demands left it overharvested, hobbled by its status as a monoculture and the constant need for ramping production. Yet this land was arable still. Next year, should Danylo and Halyna last another year, they would grow another harvest, and see a field of grain once more.\n\nPerhaps a more optimistic metaphor for Ukraine, yes, but fatalistic at its core. This field was built for harvesting. Danylo had to pray that Ukraine was not the same.\n\n\"As I have done, as I will do, as always seems to come.\""

The sun was gone, and he could not risk lighting a fire so close to the German camp. He felt as if he was floating in space, with only two companions - an earthworm and a dead sentry. He felt a deep loneliness, for not even his cause could comfort him now, dead and buried like all the cliques he'd bounced between since the defeat. The German was younger than him, which gave him the odd feeling of years passing in minutes. It used to be that the Germans were his age or older. He'd spent so much time fighting that time didn't pass, but here he was: a man sitting next to the corpse of a boy.\n\nBohdan winced, feeling as if he'd been stabbed in the stomach. His hunger pangs were worsening, and he couldn't tell if the pain from his bad leg hurt less or more. Last time he tried hunting he'd been spotted, tumbled down a hill and injured his leg. Luckily the German he was wrestling broke his skull. Sentries and camps were everywhere, stealth was no longer an option apart from taking bites out of camps. If he wanted to eat he'd have to ambush the scout camp or eat the earthworms.\n\nHe reckoned he could do it, but his leg might give out completely. So once again he asked: did the leg or the hunger hurt worse? Each one was just delaying the inevitable, for tomorrow his caved in belly would still be empty regardless of if he ate the camp's paltry food or the worms. His leg would still be useless regardless of whether he stayed put or not. He'd still be dead by the end of the year regardless of whether he fought or not - but three more Germans would be dead if he did."

Before his mother could sugarcoat her response with enough white lies to keep Markus docile, the commissar in the camp gathered the attention of the inmates, announcing in heavily accented German:\n\n\"You are gathered here until further notice, while the lands you once settled have been liberated and are now to be reorganized for denazification. Until we deem it is appropriate to release you, you shall remain to be re-educated.\"\n\nPieter's face was pale as a ghost.

Once the shaving was done, he splashed a few drops of water from his canteen onto his shaggy hair and ran his fingers through it.\n\nHe cast a sideward glance at his UA-SSR patch and uniform jacket on the ground, shoving some dirt over them with his boot. Oddly, he fit in more with the coat he'd worn as a fugitive than the one he'd worn as a soldier. Turning back to the mirror, he almost looked like a different man.

He'd found a fellow partisan, a man about his age named Andriy, and they'd walked for a few nights together, pooling resources and swapping stories. When their stocks began to run short, Andriy took a foolish risk and approached a patrol, ready with a faulty story of being a lost hiker. They didn't even give him a moment to speak.

Volodymr Bondarenko of the Culturalists was wiping his glasses on his grey trench coat. To his left, Vladimir Savchuk of the United Struggle faction played with his short collar, his satisfaction brief before readjusting it again. To his right, Ivan Leshchenko inspected his tie, before loosening it with a slight smirk. The tranquil quiet of the room was interrupted as the chief diplomat, Vasyl Stus, burst through the door and took his empty seat.\n\n\"President Horlis has demanded of us that Ukraine's sovereignty be maintained, and thus all of Galicia shall be returned to us effective immediately,\" Stus declared as he removed files from his briefcase. Turmoil filled the room, as delegates murmured to each other. The light of the room's chandelier momentarily dimmed as a score of cigarettes lit up. Savchuk grimaced as he bit into his own cigar.\n\n\"There's no way the Poles will agree to this. All this will accomplish is more bloodshed,\" Savchuk muttered.\n\n\"I have to agree. I'd love for our comrades to embrace us again, but this seems... brash,\" Leshchenko added.\n\n\"Nonsense friends! Think of Poland and Galicia like...\" Bondarenko piped before pausing, \"a mouse and its cheese! We want as much as we can get, but if we ask for too little, we'll only get a little. The mouse will either leave the cheese entirely for us out of fear, or part with enough to make us happy.

Savchuk noticed that Leshchenko's eyes glistened with tears, but he couldn't tell whether it was out of relief or jubilation.\n\n\"I'm glad you're feeling better, Ivan. Why don't we get you a drink to celebrate?\" Savchuk said, before slinging his arm around the younger man before they both rose from their seats.\n\n\"Hey Vladimir, do you know you act like my father? He would always find something to celebrate to take my mind off of things. I'm sure you and him would've been friends.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we would've. Two fathers worrying about their troublesome children,\" Savchuk responded with a slight, sad grin. The two men were greeted by Bondarenko, who had been laughing with his fellow Culturalists at the drink table.\n\n\"What did I say, Vladimir? The mouse gave us the cheese because it knew it couldn't beat us. And to think you worried about the Poles being rats with diseased claws ready to slice us apart! You need this drink more than me, my friend,\" Bondarenko boasted before handing his drink over to Savchuk. He took a sip, letting it wash away his stress, even if it was just for a fleeting moment."

A few of their more zealous members called for an immediate ultimatum, and the faction began to rally around the call of \"Galicia or war.\" This rhetoric immediately provoked a response from the United Struggle and Spivavtors, who declared the Culturalists warmongers who had sabotaged negotiations straight from the beginning. In their own corner of the table, Bondarenko and Leshchenko fought their own battle amongst themselves.\n\n\"Vladimir was entirely right about the Poles being rats, Bondarenko! We've declared our intent to take the cheese, and now they hiss like they're the cats hunting us! I want Galicia back too, but this was too much!\" Leshchenko raved. The elderly statesman took a deep breath before responding.\n\n\"Mice and rats are smart creatures, Ivan, and considering the Polish response, they're more like mewling insects. They've made it clear they don't want to negotiate, so we'll have to stomach the loss and take what we want by force, as regrettable as that is,\" Bondarenko reasoned.\n\nSavchuk eavesdropped on his friends' conversation and mused to himself.

The Moderate Culturalists, as well as the United Struggle and the Spivavtors, declared their support for the offer, urging their counterparts to accept the perfect compromise. Savchuk and Bondarenko lit their cigarettes as they discussed the development.\n\n\"Well, I can't say you were wrong, Volodymr; the Poles really did end up being mice in the end,\" Savchuk said with a chuckle.\n\n\"Life in the army taught me a valuable lesson. People become quite reasonable when a gun is pointed at them,\" Bondarenko explained, \"and if they're still stubborn, you point another gun at their friend. Eventually, you get a thousand guys pointing guns at each other, and everyone is so tired of it that they go drink vodka together. \" The two envoys laughed together, telling jokes in between puffs of their cigarettes.\n\nLeshchenko sat alone at the round table, pondering his options. Despite the common cause of the three factions, the upcoming vote on how to respond was still on a razor's edge. Logically, he should vote for the compromise, but his thoughts kept drifting to the Ukrainians still left under the Polish boot. Could he forgive himself for leaving them behind?

The arguments he had heard for it were totally logical, but would it even last once they began talks with Germania?\n\nOf course, there was always the option of leaving the borders unchanged. Many had told him that there was nothing to gain from shifting the borders like that, and in the end both groups would probably migrate back home. This sounded good to him, especially if he could get the Poles on board. It'd definitely be easier than pushing for changes, right?

Your demands were fair, but my associates didn't see the value in something so minimal.\"\n\n\"And mine lacked the spine to stick to their convictions.\"\n\nThe two diplomats smoked their cigars in silence. Whereas the negotiations were ultimately a waste of time, Leshchenko thought to himself, at least he found a new friend who shared his disappointment. A Pole and a Ukrainian brought together by shared discontent."

 UKR_POL_relation.39.t: "The Hardest Failure"
 UKR_POL_relation.39.desc: "\"Please repeat what you said to me, Vasyl, but slower, so I can fully comprehend what you're trying to tell me,\" Horlis said, exasperated, as he held his forehead. His furrowed brown revealed deep wrinkles as he attempted to mask his agitation.\n\n\"We gave the Poles the right to make demands, and we found the demands unreasonable, so we tried to negotiate down to the status quo,\" Stus replied, looking away from the revolutionary's stare that seemed to peer into his soul.\n\n\"And after that?\"\n\n\"The Poles refused.\"\n\n\"Might I inquire about something, Vasyl? If the entire plan hinged on the Poles making the demands so they would be satisfied with the results, why would you negotiate so far to give them nothing?\"\n\n\"I...\"\n\n\"Don't answer that question. The answer should be quite obvious,\" Horlis interjected, \"I'm disappointed, Vasyl, though I acknowledge the delegation most likely forced your hand. Go outside. Take the rest of the day to reflect. I promised my daughter I'd help her find a gift for her mother's birthday today, so I'd like my mood to not be soured by any more bad news you have yet to tell me.\" Horlis got up from his chair and grabbed his coat from the rack before making a hasty exit. Stus sat there, staring at the documents he placed on Horlis' desk, trying to figure out how he let this happen."
 UKR_POL_relation.39.a: "The bold move did not pay off."
 UKR_POL_relation.40.t: "An Acceptable Trade"
 UKR_POL_relation.40.desc: "\"The Poles have provided us with their demands,\" Stus said with a wide grin. \"They have asked for small amounts of land along with a series of small exchanges.\" The delegation became abuzz with agreement, while some diplomats remained silent. \"We will vote on this in an hour so we can hammer out the specifics.\" Bondarenko, Savchuk, and Leshchenk stood near the bread table discussing the development.\n\n\"It looks like the wounds of the past have healed friends, the Poles understand how valuable a partnership with us is,\" Savchuk exclaimed.\n\n\"I'm glad they share our sentiments, Vladimir. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried that the Poles would take advantage of us,\" Leschenko added.\n\n\"I wouldn't celebrate just yet,\" Bondarenko demurred as he grabbed bread from the table. \"There are some that have their doubts.\" The other two diplomats raised their eyebrows, surprised by Bondarenko's objection. \"The demands are so minimal that some of my associates believe that there's no point. They say it's a waste of resources, as we'll be left with the same situation with a different border. Effectively, nothing will change except a new hole in our budget.\" Savchuk and Leshchenko were silent, as Bondarenko took a bite from his bread.\n\n\"Except, Volodymyr, we gave the Poles the right to make demands. Asking for the status quo will make us look like fools,\" Savchuk objected, but there remained lingering doubt within his mind. Would anything truly change, besides the smiles of a few diplomats?"
 UKR_POL_relation.40.a: "We will honor our deal with the Poles."
 UKR_POL_relation.40.b: "Status quo will save both of us resources."
 UKR_POL_relation.41.t: "경제의 주제"
 UKR_POL_relation.41.desc: "Vladimir sat at the end of the table, looking between the two delegates at their respective sides of the room. Horlis and Nil both had an understanding look on their faces, as if two parents solemnly looking at each other as their children bicker. Nothing had come to a boil yet it seemed, but the tension was definitely felt throughout the room. Little had been agreed on in the few hours they had been here, just that both sides should benefit. He had felt in his gut that this would devolve into a shouting match, but as the room seemed to come close to a climax one man stood up. The man raised his voice, got the attention of the room, and all was silent.\n\nHorlis and Nil both looked surprised, and he couldn't be sure which side he belonged to. It did not matter though, as his trade proposal was the most thought thing to be proposed that morning. It seemed to shift the mood of the room when all of the others began to silently nod and agree with each other. Of course, there were objections here and there, but it wasn't anything that couldn't be ironed out. Things were beginning to look up, and Vladimir saw the two old delegates smile between each other. Another day of this and they'd have a robust economic plan between the two of them."

 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_1_1: "Further mechanization of agriculture, balancing the needs and output of the native Ukrainian farmers, alongside generally fair weather conditions, have been responsible for meeting Germany's grain export quota incredibly successfully. The Reichskommissariat will attempt to further these successes to the next cycle- they likely will need to, as the success now may only increase German expectations of future output."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_1_2: "Despite attempts at further mechanizing agriculture and balancing the needs and output of Ukrainian farmers, the increased productivity was nearly inadequate. The Reichskommissariat will have to redouble their efforts to ensure they meet future quotas, as the Germans will have increased expectations after this close call."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_1_3: "Despite efforts to modernize agriculture and meet the needs of Ukrainian farmers, these efforts proved to be inadequate in the face of Germany's mammoth quota. The Reichskommissariat must take immediate action to address this shortfall, as they can expect increased pressure from Germany in the future. Ukraine lies at the cusp of German intervention, and the necessary further disregard of native Ukranians leaves them agitated and ready to revolt at any moment."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_2_1: "The higher productivity of this cycle and the management of grain distribution has led to local needs being met comfortably, and the natives are now relatively well-fed, productive and healthy. This will likely further grain production and make regional development and exports easier."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_2_2: "The current cycle's productivity and management of grain distribution have only barely met the local needs, leaving the natives barely fed and some borderline malnourished. This will likely hinder grain production and make regional development and export quotas more challenging to meet."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_2_3: "The current cycle's productivity and management of grain distribution have failed to meet the local needs, leaving the natives malnourished and struggling to survive. This will likely hinder grain production and make meeting future regional development and export quotas extremely challenging."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_3_1: "Regional development in the current cycle has been incredibly successful, vastly exceeding the expectations of those back in Germany. With Germany having more faith in the administration's future, more investment will likely flow into Ukraine, bolstering the Reichskommissariat's further prospects. More settlers too will move into the territory - bringing with them wealth as well as more loyal german citizens, drowning out the effect of any unruly Ukrainians."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_3_2: "While regional development has met German expectations in the current cycle, it was through the skin of the administration's teeth. Ukraine still is burdened by the risk of not meeting expectations in the next cycle - which could potentially lead to future inadequate further German investment and the associated decrease in German settlement."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_3_3: "Regional development in the current cycle has not met the expectations of those in Germany. Many in the administration fear that heads will roll if this inadequacy continues. Germany's unfavorable view of the colony will likely shrink their necessary investment and jeopardize the stability of Ukraine. The Reichskommissariat will also receive fewer settlers as word of the administration's problems spread..."
