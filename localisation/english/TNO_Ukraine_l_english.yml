 POLITICS_ERICH_KOCH_DESC:0 "This is what Erich Koch has been left with. This is what he deserves.\n\nAt his peak of authority, Erich Koch was a thug upon a throne, brutal even by the standards of the Third Reich. His colonial policy was an endless cycle of exploitation and repression, designed to beat the Ukrainian people into submission. Under his watch, the Hunger Plan left the native population starving in fields of amber, and his quotas reduced them to slavery. In his mind, he had forged the very picture of Lebensraum: a blood diamond in Hitler's crown.\n\nIt could not last, of course. In the wake of the West Russian War, the Reichskommissariat was left with far more problems than Koch could comprehend. Above him, an army of administrators demanded more and more, hoping to prop up the Reich's ailing economy with further blood from its breadbasket. Below him, a crowd of natives screamed, demanding freedom from the abyss he had created. For the first time, Erich Koch was faced with problems which could not be solved with whips and hammers. The Reichskommissar was finally lost.\n\nRather than attempting major changes, the Reichskommissar has let the colony stagnate beneath him, even as terror rises and profits slow. Deep down, Erich Koch may be aware of some solution, but the man lacks the energy to change Ukraine's fate. In the name of profit, the Reichskommissar ground his colony into sand - now, he watches it blow away."
 POLITICS_VOLODYMYR_KUBIYOVYCH_DESC:0 "An age of oppression, barbarism, and bloodshed has crushed the will of many men and women to take a stand against foreign imperialism, and even fewer ordinary people would dare openly call for independence. However, Volodymyr Kubiyovych is not most people, as a lifetime as a soldier, a geographer, and a politician has shown. However, the many lifestyles of and bureaucracy surrounding Kubiyovych will not stand in the way of the one, true goal which has always persisted in the mind of the Polish-raised Ukranian, with the image of cheering Ukranians in a free state of their own.\n\nA life of study and teaching would not prepare the intellectual for the Nazi invasion of the Polish land he had lived in for most of his life, spurned by diaspora and, now, another invader of his home. Thus, Kubiyovych delved into the fire of his scorn to establish one of the few social programs on the face of Europe, helping thousands of Ukranian men, women, and children affected by the war. Meanwhile, the former cartographer chose to stand against the infamous Hans Frank in his desired slaughter of Ukranian peasants, allowing just a bit more success for his homeless people. However, as the Nazi victory came, all Kubiyovych could do was encourage the growth of the Galician Waffen-SS to use as a foundation for a pseudo-army to protect against further Nazi persecution.\n\nHowever, in the age of darkness Ukraine has found itself in, a light dawns on the horizon for Kubiyovych and his companions. Men may stand against him, clawing at him to strike down his attempts for independence. But such botherations and sins against the Ukranian people shall not stand against Kubiyovych's work with the Reich. Nothing will."

From Leibbrandt's academic and collaborator allies to Ohlendorf's SS, from Heerema's NOC to Hans-Otto Bräutigam's small but growing reformist clique, nobody in Reichskommissariat Ukraine is truly comfortable with what they have. Even the Reichskommissar, Erich Koch, is unsatisfied with his position.\n\nWith these growing cracks the Reichskommissariat's administration is inefficient and corrupt. Unless decisive action is taken soon, the Reichskommissariat may be in danger of outright collapse. With Erich Koch's refusal to take any meaningful action and firm refusal to reform in even minor, cosmetic ways, such a collapse seems likely."

 POLITICS_GEORG_LEIBBRANDT_DESC:0 "In his years as deputy, Georg Leibbrandt had always dreamed of a moment like this. To see Koch killed by his own hubris, to see every folly of the old regime laid bare, the concept of such a dramatic collapse had come as a spiteful fantasy to the deputy. Yet his dreams always ended with his domain as stable and functional, a product of his scientific reforms. They never ended like this.\n\nShoved into the twisted throne of Erich Koch, Leibbrandt never realized the level of mismanagement at every level of the Reichskommissariat. Yes, the deputy had seen the Ukrainians as natural allies, but the scale of their insubordination outmatched even his most dire scenarios. Where he imagined himself the sole reformer of Koch's broken system, he now must share power with two fellow \"visionaries\", who shoot down every one of his proposals. Even now, he hears talks in the halls of the hopped-up deputy who will be swept away as soon as the war is over. Insubordination, it seems, has outlasted even the Reichskommissariat itself.\n\nThere is no time for reform. There is no place for change. As Leibbrandt looks around his dying colony, he can only think one thought, twenty-three years. More than two decades of badly formulated plans, ill-conceived rhetoric, and petty infighting have left Ukraine in this moment. Woe to the man who is left to pick up the pieces."
