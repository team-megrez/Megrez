 FIN.125.desc: "Service for safety and peace. In exchange for martial sacrifice our families would be returned to us. Today, Helsinki's demonstrates their complete lack of dignity and their overwhelming disregard for our lives with the newest set of orders delivered to our high command. Despite our clear martial superiority, we are to surrender to the Russians.\n\nEvery single person in our high command is confused by this development. We are bleeding the Russians dry, and they have completely failed to penetrate our defenses. Have the Finns lost their stomach for war? Have they decided they won't sacrifice Finnish lives for some \"measly Russians?\" Has Helsinki lost their minds entirely?\n\nMaybe if the Finns are surrendering so early it means that the Russian government is just and not deserving of such bloodshed. Maybe this government is run by truly sensible men and women, compared to those traitorous Bolsheviks and lunatic fascists. Our men wait for our generals to give the command. These men have prepared for this fight for a long time, they might yet follow us into a bloody last stand. However, this last stand would be our forces alone, no Finnish assistance will be provided. This fight will likely be bloody, brutal, and quite possibly futile. Perhaps it is better to take our chances with this new government and lay down our arms in peace?"

 FIN.151.t: "All Hands On Deck"
 FIN.151.desc: "The Finnish government was thrown into chaos today as new reports sent shockwaves across the military. The FNS Karelia reported a strange, threatening new move from the German menace. A small detachment of German ships has been spotted, moving away from the main fleet. It is alone, weak, and also intruding on Finnish national waters. Of course, this move severely threatens Finnish national security. If we do not stop the Germans here and now, and protect our sovereign waters, what will stop the GErmans from simply ignoring our naval claims? Because of this, the military has put forth a plan to fire upon the violating ships, and drive them from our waters as a reminder of Finnish sovereignty. Perhaps losing a few thousand men to the frigid waters of the Baltic will put a message through Göring's thick skull.\n\nHowever, this plan has been met with fear and fury from the political elite, who claim that the Finnish navy is no match for the Kriegsmarine. Indeed, spme go as far as to call this a German trick, intent on fooling us into destroying our own navy, Both sides argue this issue as if it is life and death, which it very well may be. We must choose a course of action against this unprecedented threat."

 FIN.152.t: "Slaughter in the Baltic"
 FIN.152.desc: "The admiral watched with growing joy as his fleet gained on the Germans. Their ships, puny in number compared to the Finns sent to destroy them, fled before the Finnish Navy. The admiral slowly looked at the armada amassed around him. Every ship in the Finnish Navy had been sallied forth to destroy the foolish Germans, whose arrogance had led them to believe that Finland would simply roll over and allow their sovereignty to be trampled. How stupid of them!\n\nEven as the Germans tried to flee, they must have known that their days were numbered. The Finns outnumbered them, outgunned them, and were now in firing range. The last point was proven when the first salvo was fired, splashing all around the enemy. The admiral couldn't help but crack a grin as the first shots connected, and the slaughter began.\n\nThat is, until he heard the sirens wail above him.\n\nThe admiral, in his startled, looked up to see the full might of the Luftwaffe above him. The sun flashed off the wings of the dive bombers as they unloaded their payloads on to numerous ships. The admiral, along with his crew, watched in stark horror as the first boats buckled and cracked under the weight of the assault, explosions tearing their hulls apart.\n\nAs the admiral watched his pride and joy burn away in front of him, he noticed a plane coming for the ship he stood on. He would only have a moment to comprehend what it was doing before the blast of the bomb engulfed him."
 FIN.152.a: "How could we have fallen for it?"
 FIN.153.t: "An Unusually Large Blip"
 FIN.153.desc: "When the sonar operator of the FNS Karjala reported a major blip on his screen, he was first treated with incredulous. When the sonar operator of the FNS Turunmaa reported a similar blip, the air of confusion was replaced with that of dread. A quick reconnaissance flight confirmed the fleet's suspicions- Germany had sent out its fleet, and planes to back it up.\n\nHundreds of planes soar over the bulk of the Kriegsmarine, as they cut through the icy waters of the Baltic. Of course, the flimsy excuse of \"simple exercises\" provided by the German Embassy have been all but ignored by the government, who sees it as it really is- Germany is back, and it will destroy Finland if we do not comply. For a while, however, it seemed that nothing would truly come of it. The Kriegsmarine did its exercises halfheartedly while part of the Navy stood as a guard for the coast. It seemed that the situation would defuse on its own.\n\nUnfortunately, it wouldn't. Our ships have repeatedly reported small flights of Luftwaffe bombers buzzing their decks, flying directly over them and occasionally diving as if to attack only to pull away at the last minute. This situation has sent our admirals into a frenzy, as they demand to send more ships to the coast to counter these acts of aggression. Increasing the tension in this situation seems to be a terrible idea, but leaving our ships undefended is just as bad. We must make a choice, unfortunately."
 FIN.153.a: "Do nothing. They will leave eventually."
 FIN.153.b: "We need to protect our boys. Send the rest."
 FIN.154.t: "Åland Seized!"
 FIN.154.desc: "Our government was once again thrown into chaos yesterday as a shocking development came from the Åland islands. In a series of increasingly desperate messages, the garrison stationed on the islands relayed information thought to be impossible- Wehrmacht forces have landed and seized the islands, presumably as a jumping off point for a future invasion of our homeland. While Göring has made his fair share of threats against us, our nation, and our future, never has he seized our territory so brazenly, or threatened us so openly.\n\nOur parliament is now split into pieces, as shock and terror runs rampant among our populace. While most of our leaders, including almost all of the generals and admirals, demand that a state of war be declared, our army is not yet entirely ready to hold the German menace back in the case of war. The more pragmatic men among our legislation argue that we continue our policy of retaining and conserving our resources, rather than expending all of our assets over a few rocks in the Baltic. Though this would undoubtedly be an unpopular choice with the hawks, perhaps preparing a defensive struggle will be a more successful strategy. Either way, we must now make our choice."
 FIN.154.a: "We must defend our territory!"
 FIN.154.b: "We must prepare further."
 FIN.155.t: "The Battle of Åland"
 FIN.155.desc: "Shocking news has returned from the Åland Islands, as has been a constant in the last few weeks. However, this news is different, in that it is positive. According to frenzied reports from the local garrison, Göring and his band of gangsters attempted an attack on our islands, and would have succeeded had it not been for the swift action of our navy. With the quick thinking and swift action emblematic of a true Finnish warrior, our navy obliterated the landing force, sending thousands of German thugs to rot at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nRaucous celebration and joyous parades have sprung up in major population centers, and already our legislature has come together to issue a statement proclaiming our unity in the face of such adversity. However, some questions have arisen in terms of what we are to do, now that the Germans have been thoroughly defeated. Many of the more hawkish men in our government push for an immediate declaration of war, claiming that this battle shows our superiority to the massed, conscripted men in the Wehrmacht. Other, more pacifistic men have instead pushed for a continuance of our armed neutrality, as they claim that Göring will focus elsewhere after this defeat. Whether this is true or not remains to be seen, but the fact remains that our men, in a stand up fight against the numbers and equipment of the Wehrmacht, would be facing long odds. Whichever we choose, we can only hope we only win victories such as this."
 FIN.155.a: "Press the advantage! To war!"
 FIN.155.b: "We've shown we have claws."
 FIN.156.t: "최후 통첩"
 FIN.156.desc: "Though previous news between us and the Reich has sent the government into a fearful panic, nothing compares to the latest passage sent to us. In near disbelief, the government sits paralyzed, and all because of one quick note directly from Germania. In this note, Göring himself writes in great detail of the great historical relationship between Finn and German, as if we have not been skirmishing with the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe for the last few months. The first paragraph is laden with compliments to our racial stock, our history, our tradition of \"beating back the Bolshevik Russian\", and our people. If one was to cut out the first paragraph and only read that, they may think that this was a love letter.\n\nThe second paragraph is decidedly less friendly.\n\nIn the second paragraph, Göring notes the statistics of the Wehrmacht compared to our forces, the disparity in training and manpower, and the hopelessness of our situation. He concludes the letter with a simple offer- join the Einheitspakt, or die.\n\nThis is no easy thing to answer, as Finnish society tears itself apart over what this may mean for Finland. We must make a choice- can we fend off the Germans for long enough, but run the risk of destruction? Or shall we submit to the Reich's claws, and live to see another day?"
 FIN.156.a: "We have no choice."
 FIN.156.b: "We will not lay down and die!"
 FIN.157.t: "A Second Ultimatum"
 FIN.157.desc: "The war continues, and with it comes a heavy cost. Thousands of Finnish men die on the field of battle every week, as the German tide slowly grows stronger and stronger. At home, the cities alternate between the silence of a strict curfew and the chaos of daily bombing raids. The countryside slowly empties, either from the men going to war or the people leaving for the safety of the interior. Above all else, our economy falters, with all trade being cut off from the entire world. It seems if we continue this war, the nation may be doomed.\n\nGöring, unbelievably enough, has given us out in the form of a second ultimatum. This letter is significantly more blunt and harsh than the last. There are no formalities or pleasantries. Indeed, the letter is but a paragraph in length. The new ultimatum would, upon our acceptance of the terms, simply incorporate us into Reichskommissariat Skandinavien. There would be no autonomy, or freedom, or any other special circumstance for us, but our people would live to see another day.\n\nHowever, our generals still push to continue the fight. By the observations of both our economists and our military men, the German giant stands on extremely weak legs, buoyed only by the loot of those nations who have fallen to it. If we hold long enough, the Reich may fall in on itself again, allowing us to escape with our independence, our freedom, and above all else, our pride. This would be risky, but in the situation we are in, it must be considered.\n\nWe now come to what may be the greatest crossroad in Finnish history- do we give in and submit to Göring and his thugs, or take a great risk and keep fighting, for the chance of survival?"

Pruning those who care about Finland from those who do not is an entirely different question. One that is guaranteed to be resolved the correct way.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is clear that some are born to see the whole picture - and some are born to actually deal with it. Johannes Virolairen is one of those men who will nominate scapegoats for the nation's sake - a patriot thinking only of the nation's greater good. Either way, he needs to enter power..."
 FIN_Asko_Ivalo_for: "The art of diplomacy is a delicate one, and often involves knowing when to draw powerful neighbours close, and when to keep them at arm's length. Asko Ivalo knows this all too well, as one of Helsinki's most experienced diplomats, and one of the architects of Finland's current close relations with the Reich.\n\nEver since the rebirth of the modern nation of Finland, powerful neighbours have sought to 'rectify' the anomaly of her independence - and the ever-present solution has always been to draw closer to the one nation that never had and never will have territorial designs on even a square metre of Finnish soil. As a member of the SS Voluntary Committee of '42, Ivalo sealed in iron and blood the nation's commitment to Germany's cause by helping organise a Waffen-SS division of Finnish volunteers, and continues to support pro-German policies within the Finnish government, both out of pragmatism and to ensure the continued loyalty of the IKL and the powerful shadows lurking in the corners of power, seeking closer alignment with the Pakt as a whole."
 FIN_Paivio_Hetemaki_eco: "In a world where the ties between nations have been torn apart, Päiviö Hetemäki seeks to rebuild Finland's link to the global market. In fact, most of his programme can be described in terms of rebuilding - of the relations between employers and workers, of economic ties with both Western Europe and the United States, and of Finnish worker's wages.\n\nOwing to this he also forms part of the bloc supporting further market integration with Europe as a whole, and thus for Albert Speer's reformist group in far-away Germania. It remains to be seen if his moderate, rational policies can survive when it seems the most chaotic years of Finland's history are fast approaching, but for now he marches on, slowly but steadily."
 FIN_Pekka_Malinen_sec: "Once Prime Minister, Pekka Malinen now serves as Defence Minister - an important transition that allows him to ensure the continuation of his policies of ensuring Finland keeps what it has earned, and deserved for so long.\n\nHaving served several tours of combat as a member of the SS, Malinen found himself in the political wilderness following his tenure during the West Russian War - until it was realised that he, and his Finnish People's Party, were far too influential to exclude from government - this, despite the relatively small size of the party. Now, his policies revolve around the same three tenets - increasing support for Onega as the vanguard of the nation, increasing the military budget, and expanding the military infrastructure in Karelia to more rapidly deploy forces against the ever-present partisan threat."
