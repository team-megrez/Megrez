 POLITICS_YURIY_HORLIS_DESC:0 "What is culture? What is it that mends and defines so many nations, and what is it that Germany has obsessed over since the beginning of the NSDAP's rule over Germany, then Europe?\n\nIf you were to ask Yuriy Yuryovych Horlis, the leader of the Ukrainian branch of the Polissian Guard, however, he would tell you of what makes up the culture of Ukraine; the language, the freedom, and the determination for a Ukrainian state. Horlis has fought for these values since before the days of the Galicians' first forays into western Ukraine, spreading the ideals which Yuriy had always believed in, since his days as a liaison for the first Ukrainian People's Republic. With the help of his ethnic and ideological allies within Galicia, however, it will be far from the last. So long as the Ukrainian culture survives, then Ukraine will always survive.\n\nFor now, however, Horlis will fight tooth and nail for his people and will unite Ukraine, once and for all. From Galicia to Yuzivka, Ukraine will be made whole, and it will finally come to know the democracy it was robbed of so long ago, by the Russians and communists of years past.\n\nNow, however, is not the time to reflect on the past. Now is the time to look towards the future. A future of an eternal Ukrainian culture, a future of a legitimate democracy for Ukraine, and a future where Ukrainians can walk tall without a German or Russian pointing a gun at their back. With Galicia and Ukraine at his back, it is not a question of when Ukraine will become free, but how Yuriy Horlis will do it.\n\nOr so he prays."
