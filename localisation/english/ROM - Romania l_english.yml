 ROM_lay_the_seeds_for_the_camarilla_desc: "이 나라의 다른 정치 세력들이 대부분 소외되어 왔기 때문에, 왕이 왕권을 완전히 장악하기 위해 넘어야 할 장애물은 군단 운동밖에 없습니다. 그들은 보기에 강력해 보일지 모르지만, 왕은 교활하며 그의 정치적 음모에 대한 감각을 통해 우리는 성공적으로 이 녹색 셔츠들의 망치를 제쳐놓을 수 있습니다."
 ROM_royal_foundation_of_arts_and_sciences: "왕립예술과학재단"
 ROM_royal_foundation_of_arts_and_sciences_desc: "루마니아 국가에는 기발한 정신의 부족함이 없으며, 국왕의 지혜 덕에 이러한 정신을 지닌 많은 사람들의 잠재력을 끌어내기 위해서 필요한 것은 단지 약간의 추가 지원뿐이라는 것을 알고 있습니다. 왕립예술과학재단을 설립함으로써 우리는 예술과 지식의 후원자라는 명성을 얻고 지식인 계층의 왕실에 대한 지지를 증가시킬 것입니다."
 ROM_appear_alongside_codreanu: "Appear Alongside 코드레아누"
 ROM_appear_alongside_codreanu_desc: "소위 선장이라고 불리는 코르넬리우 젤레아 코드레아누는 언뜻 보기에는 그다지 강력해 보이지 않을진 몰라도 그는 여전히 많은 사람들에게 민족 통일의 희망을 대변하는 존재입니다. 그러나 이 사람들은 국왕도 그런 역할을 맡을 수 있다고 생각할 수도 있고, 하늘에 두 개의 태양이 있을 수 없듯이 국왕은 그의 옛 부하에게서 관심을 가로채야 합니다."
 ROM_study_the_legionaries: "군단 연구"
 ROM_study_the_legionaries_desc: "이 군단 훌리건들은 왕을 배제하고 스스로 나라를 운영하려 해서 왕을 점점 더 화나게 만들고 있습니다만, 그들의 통치가 꽤 유용하다는 것을 부정할 수는 없습니다. 우리 조국의 사랑스러운 아들인 국왕 폐하가 정당한 자리를 차지하기 위해서 우리는 그들의 계획에서 적어도 몇 페이지 정도는 가져와야 합니다."
 ROM_rural_outreach: "농촌 지원"
 ROM_rural_outreach_desc: "The Romanian nation has a profoundly rural character, making the peasantry the nation's basic building block. Unfortunately, they can be too preoccupied with their local surroundings to pay attention to what truly matters. By well-placed visits and rural development programmes, the peasantry will be swayed towards His Majesty's figure, and they shall rally around their King like the planets around the Sun."
 ROM_support_dimitrie_giusti: "디미트리에 구스티 지원"
 ROM_support_dimitrie_giusti_desc: "뛰어난 교수이자 사회학자인 디미트리 구스티는 왕에 대한 약간의 연민을 가진 사람으로, 농촌 사회에서 중요한 인류학 연구를 수행해 왔습니다. 우리는 구스티 교수가 연구를 수행하는데 필요한 돈을 주고, 농민들 사이에서 승리하기 위한 대규모 문화 프로그램을 시작할 것입니다. 우리의 통치는 태양처럼 밝게 빛날 것입니다!"

 ROM_sentinels_of_the_fatherland_desc: "나라의 미래인 청년들의 역할을 끊임없이 이해해 온 왕은 청년단체를 설립해서 그들이 성년기를 보다 적절하게 준비하고 위대한 민족의 가치와 덕목을 가르치기로 했습니다. 이 파수꾼들은 신에 대한 믿음, 왕에 대한 믿음, 노동과 희생에 대한 믿음, 그리고 국가와 인민의 단결을 위한 연락책이라는 파수꾼의 신념으로 살아가야 합니다."
 ROM_prepare_the_grand_union: "국가를 위한 모든 것"
 ROM_prepare_the_grand_union_desc: "The Romanian phrase Totul pentru Ţară, literally \"Everything for the Country\", is the official name of the Iron Guard. It's the duty of every Romanian to sacrifice himself for his country, and we need to remind the people of that."

 ROM_across_the_carpathians_desc: "20여년 전 우리의 전쟁계획은 이론적으로는 이상이 없었지만, 많은 요인들로 인해 실전에서는 방해가 되었습니다. 우리는 적들의 불길 앞에서 더욱더 저항할 수 있도록 그것들을 정교하게 다듬어 때가 오면 과감하게 산을 넘어 우리의 형제를 해방할 것입니다."

 ROM_tisa_border: "자연 국경"
 ROM_tisa_border_desc: "협상국은 우리에게 1916년에 티서 강까지의 땅을 내 주기로 약속했지만, 파르티움의 상대적으로 적은 루마니아 인구수를 고려할 때 우리는 그곳을 떠나 옛 프랑스와의 연결을 통해 서부의 국경을 그릴 것을 고려하고 있습니다. 하지만 몇몇 사람들은 지금이 아니면 다시는 찾아오지 않을 기회라고 주장하며, 드네스트르 강에서 티서 강까지를 루마니아의 국경으로 삼아야 한다고 주장합니다."
 ROM_entente: "옛 협상국과의 연결끈"
 ROM_entente_desc: "In 1916, Romania joined the Entente powers at the height of Russian victories against the Central Powers. While we were defeated, the remnants of the Entente have persisted through capitulations and revolutions. Now that Romania is free and independent once more, we are naturally gravitating towards our former allies, and we should formally request to rejoin them in their noble endeavour."
 ROM_finish_reunion: "The Loose Ends"

 ROM_nationalization: "외국 자산 국유화"
 ROM_nationalization_desc: "부쿠레슈티 조약으로 인해서 루마니아의 중요한 경제적 자산은 동맹국의 공동지배하에 놓이거나 직접적으로 외국인들의 손아귀에 떨어졌습니다. 그러나 검은 월요일은 독일의 경제 패권을 무너뜨렸고 그들의 루마니아에 있는 많은 자산들은 파산 신청을 하고 있습니다. 지금은 그들을 다시 국가와 국민의 손에 맡겨서 우리 경제에 대한 통제권을 되찾아야 할 때입니다."
 ROM_organise_relief_work: "구제 사업 조직"
 ROM_organise_relief_work_desc: "경제 붕괴는 우리가 생각했던 최악의 경우였지만, 다행히도 우리는 비옥한 토양을 가지고 있습니다. 우리에게 잠깐 영향을 미칠수도 있지만, 우리는 수출하기로 되어 있던 곡물의 일부를 잠시 보류해서 우리 민족이 굶주리는 것을 막을 수 있습니다."
 ROM_safeguard_banks: "Safeguard the Banking Sector"
 ROM_safeguard_banks_desc: "신용 부문이 무너지는 것은 더 나쁜 경제 위기로 이어질 뿐입니다. 농부들은 그들의 돈을 돌려받지 못하거나 대출을 갚을 수 없을 테고, 사업체들은 더 나빠질 것이기 때문입니다. 은행 부문은 우리의 미래 프로젝트를 위해 예비금을 가질 수 있도록 유지되어야만 합니다."
 ROM_reorient_economy: "새로운 시장 탐색"
 ROM_reorient_economy_desc: "While the German economic sphere is in ruins there are not many options available for trade deals, but both the Russian and the Entente governments have signalled us of their interest in buying Romanian oil and agricultural products to alleviate their own shortages. This is surely a beautiful start of new friendship."
 ROM_continue_the_land_reform: "군단 개혁 지속"
 ROM_continue_the_land_reform_desc: "Codreanu's ambitious land reform was stopped by opposition from the king and the wealthy landowners, who prefer the unequal status quo. We must break up the great estates and redistribute the land for all instead of just the small, aristocratic elite - no matter how much bad blood it is going to create among them."

 ROM_compromise_with_the_landholders_desc: "토지 재분배는 토지를 소유한 귀족들과의 합의 없이 이루어질 수 없습니다. 아마도 우리는 대지주와 소농들을 모두 만족시킬 수 있는 타협점을 찾을 수 있을 것입니다."
 ROM_rural_development_loans: "소농들을 위한 대출"
 ROM_rural_development_loans_desc: "As the Legion considers the peasant to be central to the Romanian nation, it is only natural that we truly reflect our beliefs by supporting small farmers economically. Loans in rural areas, which make up the majority of the country, should be affordable in order to help grow the economy and improve conditions."

 ROM_export_more_than_grain_desc: "루마니아 경제가 시장의 세계에서 번창하기 위해서는 다변화만이 탄탄한 국가경제 기반을 조성하는 최선의 방법입니다. 이것은 루마니아의 경제가 더 이상 곡물 시장과 변동되는 곡물 가격에 좌우되지 않도록 보장할 것입니다."

 ROM_begin_mechanization_desc: "기계화는 루마니아 농장의 생산성을 기하급수적으로 향상시켜 의심의 여지없이 농촌 경제 상태를 개선할 것이며, 동시에 대다수의 루마니아마인들의 생계를 향상시키고 풍요로운 식탁을 보장할 것입니다."
 ROM_rural_infrastructure_development: "시골 지역 연결"
 ROM_rural_infrastructure_development_desc: "농촌은 대체로 도시와 단절되어 있을 뿐만 아니라 다른 농촌과도 단절되어 있습니다. 나라를 연결하면 국민들이 더 가까워지겠지만, 사회 기반 시설과 건설에 전반적으로 상당한 투자를 필요로 할 것입니다. 그러나 이러한 투자는 수많은 일자리를 창출하기 때문에 경제를 발전시킬 것입니다."
 ROM_diversify_agriculture: "농업 다양화"
 ROM_diversify_agriculture_desc: "루마니아는 여전히 농촌 사회이며 가까운 미래에도 계속 그것을 유지할 것으로 보입니다. 하지만 이것은 농부들이 하나의 농작물에 의존해야 한다는 것을 의미하진 않습니다. 루마니아 농부들은 토양과 국가 경제를 건강하게 유지하기 위해 다양한 작물을 키워야 합니다."

 ROM_bridge_the_urban_rural_gap_desc: "루마니아가 극심한 도시와 농촌의 분열로 고통받고 있다는 것은 모두가 알고 있습니다. 소작농과 노동자들이 서로 만나본 적이 없는 나라가 점점 더 상호 연결되면서 이 분열은 서서히 치유되고 있습니다. 나누어질 수 없는 하나의 국가를 형성하고 있는 루마니아인들은 서로 다른 지역과 배경을 가진 사람들과 가까워지기 위해 더 많은 노력을 기울여야 합니다."
 ROM_focus_on_quality: "품질에 집중"
 ROM_focus_on_quality_desc: "루마니아가 세계의 다른 위대한 산업 국가들과 비교할 수 있는 발전된 산업 기반을 볼 일은 아마 거의 없을 것입니다. 하지만, 루마니아인들은 양에 초점을 맞추기 보다는, 넓은 세상에서 그들만의 작은 틈새 시장을 확보하기 위해 제한된 능력의 질에 초점을 맞춰야 합니다."
 ROM_exploit_the_rivers: "강을 활용하다"
 ROM_exploit_the_rivers_desc: "루마니아의 많은 강들은 운송과 수력 발전을 통해 무한한 성장과 발전의 기회를 제공합니다. 이것은 국가의 상당한 투자를 필요로 하지만, 장기적인 혜택은 막대할 것입니다."
 ROM_restore_the_grazelands: "목초지의 복원"
 ROM_restore_the_grazelands_desc: "동물들을 위한 목초지는 건강한 농경 경제에 매우 중요하지만 루마니아 농경지의 상당 부분이 지난 수년간 산업화와 대규모 사유지로 손실되었습니다. 선장은 이것이 농민들에게 큰 영향을 미칠 것으로 보고 국가의 경제적 생존력을 향상시키기 위해 목초지를 복구하는 것을 돕고자 합니다."

 ROM_foster_romanian_industry_desc: "루마니아는 자국의 산업 규모가 다른 서구 국가들과 동등한 수준으로 발전해야만 현대국가가 될 것입니다. 국왕은 국가에 걸맞은 산업을 창출하기 위한 목적을 달성하기 위해 산업을 더욱 지원하고자 합니다."

 ROM_prosperity_for_all_desc: "일반적인 루마니아인들은 나라의 부와 성장에도 불구하고 너무 오랫동안 삶의 질이 개선되지 못했습니다. 개혁이 구체화되면서 점점 더 많은 루마니아인들이 경제 발전과 성장의 영향을 받게 될 것입니다. 앞으로 부유한 지주나 금권 정치인들만이 아니라 나라 전체가 실제로 루마니아의 번영을 느끼고 다른 나라들이 따를 수 있는 등불이 될 것입니다."
 ROM_engineering: "산업 개발"
 ROM_engineering_desc: "산업화에는 많은 공장을 짓는 것보다 더 많은 뜻이 있습니다. 효율을 높이기 위해 장비와 공구를 구입, 제작 또는 현대화해야 합니다. 따라서 우리는 루마니아 산업이 경쟁력을 유지하고 그 가치를 유지하기 위해 끊임없는 개발과 발명의 세계에서 새로운 산업 기술에 투자해야 합니다."
 ROM_support_malaxa: "말락사"
 ROM_support_malaxa_desc: "니콜라에 말락사는 아마도 가장 성공한 루마니아 산업가이며 가장 부유하고 연줄이 좋은 사람 중 한 명일 것입니다. 말락사 회사와 그의 열정을 지원함으로써 우리는 루마니아의 경제를 더욱 발전시키는 데 중요한 역할을 할 수 있는 재정적, 산업적 보상을 받을 것입니다."
 ROM_refine_the_refineries: "정유소 정제"
 ROM_refine_the_refineries_desc: "플로이에슈티 유전은 유럽에서 가장 풍부한 유전으로 알려져 있습니다. 하지만, 현재의 정유시설은 그 잠재력의 극히 일부에 불과합니다. 국가의 지원이 있으면 석유 산업을 더욱 확장하고 그 보상을 얻을 수 있습니다."

 ROM_legacy_of_berhelot_desc: "앙리 베르틀로는 벨트크리크 동안 루마니아에서 프랑스 군사 지원군을 지휘했습니다. 1916년의 참패 이후 우리 군을 재건하고 동맹국의 연합 공격에서 여러 차례 승리를 거둘 수 있었던 것은 그의 노력이 컸습니다. 그의 유산은 1917년 그가 그랬던 것처럼 루마니아 군대를 재건하고 싶어하는 많은 사람들과 함께 우리의 장교들 사이에서 오랫동안 이어져 왔습니다."
 ROM_carpathian_fortresses: "카르파티아 요새들"
 ROM_carpathian_fortresses_desc: "우리가 곧 다시 카르파티아에서 싸울 것이라는 것은 더 이상 비밀이 아닙니다. 거대한 산맥은 방어 측에게 매우 유리하며, 오스트리아-헝가리가 골목을 통제하는 동안은 그들의 공격에 정면으로 맞설 준비가 되어 있어야 합니다. 요새는 모든 공격자들에게 혹독한 대가를 치르게 하고 효과적으로 역습할 기회를 제공해 줍니다."
 ROM_expand_the_fortifications: "요새화 확장"
 ROM_expand_the_fortifications_desc: "현재 요새 라인은 완전히 부실합니다. 당장 몰다비아만 봐도 방어선이 여전히 허술합니다. 우리가 기존의 이점을 더 활용하기 위해서는 북쪽의 경로까지 요새선을 확장해야 합니다."
 ROM_artillery_development: "사람 대신 포탄"
 ROM_artillery_development_desc: "우리는 적들로부터 심각한 인력 손실을 당해서 루마니아인들의 목숨 하나하나가 귀한 상황입니다. 반면, 물질적인 소실은 대체하기가 훨씬 쉽습니다. 따라서 우리는 대체 불가능한 우리의 보병들을 제대로 방어할 수 있도록 더 많은 무기와 탄약을 비축해야 합니다."

 ROM_marasti_marasesti_oituz_desc: "동맹국과의 전쟁은 적들의 전략적 승리들에도 불구하고 루마니아의 전술적 승리로 가득합니다. 머러슈티와 마라세스티 전투는 압도적인 시련 앞에서 루마니아의 능력과 용맹을 보여주는 가장 훌륭한 예시입니다. 우리는 다시 싸우기 전에 무엇이 이러한 승리를 그렇게 위대하게 만들었는지, 그리고 무엇이 전투를 실패하게 만들었는지를 알아야 합니다."
 ROM_defense_focus: "적들의 피를 말려라"
 ROM_defense_focus_desc: "그들이 위험한 산길을 건너 우리에게 오도록 하십시오. 우리는 우리 무기의 납과 강철로 그들을 맞이할 것입니다. 그들이 단 한 명의 루마니아인의 목숨을 앗아가기도 전에 우리가 먼저 그들의 피를 남김없이 말릴 것입니다. 이번에 통일을 위한 전쟁 비용을 치를 사람들은 그들이 될 것입니다."

 ROM_spirit_of_aggression_desc: "우리가 요새에 쪼그리고 앉아 있기만 한다면 카르파티아 너머의 루마니아인들에게 자유를 가져다 줄 수 없습니다. 우리는 1916년에 실패했던 것을 적들에게 성공시켜야 하며, 그렇지 않으면 적들이 공격하기 쉬운 목표물 정도밖에 되지 못할 것입니다."
 ROM_armour_development: "루마니아 기갑 개발"
 ROM_armour_development_desc: "루마니아의 석유 산업은 우리에게 차량화와 기계화를 할 수 있는 훌륭한 위치를 제공했습니다. 전차는 절대 과소평가될 수 없는 무시무시한 무기로, 중포가 앞 열까지 기어들어오는 것을 기다릴 필요 없이 전방과 후방에 화력을 퍼부을 수 있습니다."

 ROM_modern_calarasi: "Modern Calarasi"
 ROM_modern_calarasi_desc: "Calarasi are Romanian cavalrymen that have been around since the early days of the Romanian principalities. With our focus on mobility, it has become imperative that we modernise our cavalry into a modern force with trucks, tanks, and cars as the horseman's value on the battlefield diminishes, but his speed remains essential."
 ROM_mobility_and_infiltration: "충격 전술"
 ROM_mobility_and_infiltration_desc: "The Weltkrieg has proven that mobility and shock remains the primary way to achieve total victory. We must avoid the static warfare that plagued many fronts and ensure that our forces remain mobile and maintain initiative over the enemy."
 ROM_offense_focus: "Strike Like Lightning"
 ROM_offense_focus_desc: "Speed is everything. It means we can strike the enemy first, while maintaining initiative means our foes cannot respond properly, always on the back foot. This is the only way we can overwhelm and destroy the enemy before they can destroy us with numbers."
 ROM_mountain_hunters: "Carpathian Hunters"
 ROM_mountain_hunters_desc: "The \"Vânători\", or Hunters, were formed in 1917, modelled after the French Chasseurs Alpin in response to Austria-Hungary's elite Kaiserschützen. Mountain warfare will be inevitable in the future and our mountaineers must be ready to fight a deadly modern war in the Carpathians."

 ROM_high-altitude_training: "고고도 훈련"
 ROM_high-altitude_training_desc: "The peaks and narrow passes of the Carpathians will inevitably become a battlefield again. Ski troops have proven to be instrumental in this type of terrain and we must ensure that we have soldiers trained in this difficult and specific method of warfare."

 ROM_euxine_raiders: "Euxine Raiders"
 ROM_euxine_raiders_desc: "Submarines are now proven raiders. The previous war made that very obvious, and the Romanian Navy should take full advantage of their capabilities to wreak havoc throughout the Black Sea."
 ROM_the_king_ferdinand: "The King Ferdinand"
 ROM_the_king_ferdinand_desc: "A proper flagship for the Romanian Navy has been envisioned for quite some time, but never made reality. This dream must be made a reality as we become a serious power in the Black Sea. Considering our capabilities and limitations, a cruiser will certainly do."
 ROM_black_sea_dominance: "흑해의 왕립해군"
 ROM_black_sea_dominance_desc: "The Black Sea is one of the major economic artery for our nation; seeking to achieve supremacy over it is merely natural to protect our interests. Just as the British once ruled the waves, we, Romanians, will rule the Black Sea. It is, after all, a far more realistic and practical goal for our navy."
 ROM_river_gunboats: "Expand the Danube Flotilla"
 ROM_river_gunboats_desc: "The Danube Flotilla proved to be instrumental in harassing the Central Powers' offensives while supporting our own land forces during the war. As it is likely to fight its Austro-Hungarian counterpart once more, it should be further expanded."

 ROM_legacy_of_vlaicu_and_vuia_desc: "Traian Vuia and the late Aurel Vlaicu are Romania's greatest aviation pioneers. Their skills were not only limited to piloting, but to aircraft design as well. Our future pilots and fighters will bear the legacy of Romania's aeronautical heroes."
 ROM_ground_support_operations: "Flying Artillery"
 ROM_ground_support_operations_desc: "Light bomber aircraft rapidly gained the moniker \"flying artillery\" during the Weltkrieg, as their use on the field has been rapidly seen as a new form of artillery. As artillery remains the king of the battlefield, it is only natural that we invest in their apparent, aerial successors."

 ROM_rain_fire_upon_them: "Rain Fire Upon Them"
 ROM_rain_fire_upon_them_desc: "Our Air Force's focus should be to support ground units with air support, bombing targets and strong points to facilitate the Army's fighting capabilities. Our enemies should fear the skies as our bombers cannot let them feel safe."

 ROM_drop_them_from_the_sky_desc: "The Air Force's primary goal is to destroy the enemy's aircraft. This is the only way to protect both our soldiers and citizens from enemy warplanes. Any bombing mission should only be considered when we have achieved air superiority."

 ROM_king_under_surveillance: "A King Under Surveillance"
 ROM_king_under_surveillance_desc: "While the institution of the monarchy is respectable, it is clear that it must be kept from intervening too much within our affairs. By making sure that vital court offices are always staffed by our men, we can reduce the king's manoeuvring room enough that he will have no choice but to cooperate. If the king is the symbol of the nation, he must not stand in the path of its will, as embodied by us."

 ROM_from_camps_to_factories_desc: "As our nation develops, while the work camps will continue to toughen our men, our factories will need workers to actually man them. As such, work camp service will segue well into a later career in the factories of our great nation."
 ROM_agrarian_base: "Green Agrarian Roots"
 ROM_agrarian_base_desc: "Even though our movement originated from nationalist studentry, our first proper base of support was the peasantry, and we shall honour our past in more ways than one by carefully promoting our people's agrarian heritage. Without them, we wouldn't stand today, and no matter where our nation goes, they shall accompany us for evermore."
 ROM_agency_of_public_works_focus: "공공사업국"
 ROM_agency_of_public_works_focus_desc: "With power in our hands, we can properly centralise and direct public works efforts in our country. Where the state once failed, we will succeed in bringing the benefits of good infrastructure in the countryside, and generations upon generations shall be thankful for our efforts today."
 ROM_tradition_eternal: "Tradition Eternal"
 ROM_tradition_eternal_desc: "It is not our way to recklessly send our men dashing into danger, as losing the cream of our crop would only weaken our strength just like what happened at Nicopole or at Crecy all those years ago. We shall instead adhere to the Captain's way and maintain our strength in reserve, while setting ourselves up to have the high ground in any direct confrontation."
 ROM_obligatory_camp_service: "Obligatory Camp Service"
 ROM_obligatory_camp_service_desc: "In order for our men to be as prepared for life as possible, the Captain has decided that each member of the Legion must fulfil a term of service within our expanding work camp service. Not only will this toughen them up, it will also help entrench our reputation as selfless workers in service of the Fatherland, and the results of their labour will stand for evermore."
 ROM_expand_hierarchy: "Expand the Hierarchy of the Legion"
 ROM_expand_hierarchy_desc: "As our movement grows, the Legion's hierarchic structure must grow as well, not only to accommodate the increased numbers but to maintain the Captain's firm grasp as well. Keeping the Movement focused helped us gain power, and maintaining its discipline will help us keep cohesion and face the future as one soul."
 ROM_spiritual-national_guide: "Spiritual-National Guide"
 ROM_spiritual-national_guide_desc: "The Captain is more than just the prime minister, more than the leader of the Legion and the Party; no, he is a spiritual and national guide for the Romanian nation, who tirelessly works for our country's benefit and sets forth the path we take towards our country's new future. He doesn't need to bother with usual party politics, for at this point he can be safely said to be above them."
 ROM_like_sun_in_the_sky: "A Country as the Sun in the Sky"
 ROM_like_sun_in_the_sky_desc: "With the Great Legionary Victory achieved and with the country firmly in our grasp, we shall set forth towards making Romania a country like the blessed Sun in the Sky; radiant, envied, bountiful and sanctifying of all that it graces. While we have made major strides towards this goal, there is still much to do, but with faith in our Captain and in our noble blood, we shall make our dream a reality."
 ROM_second_legionary_victory: "Second Legionary Victory"
 ROM_second_legionary_victory_desc: "The royal attempt to topple us may have sent shock waves throughout the movement, but our resolve has proven itself stronger! The people have not forgotten their true benefactors and have propelled us back into power! We will make sure that this second chance will not be wasted."
 ROM_defang_the_movement: "Defang the Movement"
 ROM_defang_the_movement_desc: "As much as our more... unique approaches to problems have helped us in the past, the fact they have led to problems is undeniable. We should at least make a token effort to seem more respectable, even if behind the scenes we are just the same as ever."
 ROM_alliance_with_the_church: "교회와의 동맹"
 ROM_alliance_with_the_church_desc: "As much as some clerics would prefer to dissociate from us, we still have been very stalwart in the defence of the Holy Church and the Right Faith. It is only logical that we attempt to further court that most noble of organisations. What are we if not defenders of the faith in the face of godless syndicalists, after all?"
 ROM_agrarian_price_controls: "Agrarian Price Controls"
 ROM_agrarian_price_controls_desc: "The market, while an useful tool to attain great wealth for our nation, can also be an unyielding malefactor for our poor, who can end up having to resort to bartering or subsistence farming to get the foodstuff they need. No longer, for we will impose a set of relatively static prices for basic foodstuff, so that years from now the basic price for bread as imagined by everyone shall be the one dictated by us."
 ROM_legionary_culture_centers: "Legionary Culture Centres"
 ROM_legionary_culture_centers_desc: "Without proper awareness of our culture, we would lose ourselves in the fogs of history; to avoid this prospective shame, we will open up a series of cultural centres across the country, meant to educate the Romanian people to their heritage and help them see their great purpose, sponsored and aided along by our faithful cavaliers in green of course."
 ROM_numerus_valachicus: "Numerus Valachicus"
 ROM_numerus_valachicus_desc: "Our country's university system has a worrying proportion of non-Romanian students. In the past, our student population had grown weary of this perceived intrusion, lighting up the spark that would lead to our movement's founding. We shall introduce a special form of numerus clausus that ties student population to demographic percentages, guaranteeing Romanian majorities."
 ROM_legionary_cooperatives: "Legionary Cooperatives"
 ROM_legionary_cooperatives_desc: "Through the years of combat and rulership, our system of cooperatives has proven itself an useful way to make money and increase Legionary ties, both between themselves and the average people. Let us expand our unique little trade and entrench our role in the country's economic system!"
 ROM_court_the_king: "Court the King"
 ROM_court_the_king_desc: "His Majesty reportedly was aghast when he heard of our election victory, and considering the troubles that led to this peculiar situation, he cannot be blamed. However, to avoid the troubles we had with the last king, Carol II, we should at least try to play nice with His Majesty; if it seems like we try to uphold democracy in some way, the chances of being ousted early will decrease accordingly."
 ROM_the_first_among_parties: "The First Among the Parties"
 ROM_the_first_among_parties_desc: "Our status as the first among equals within the evolving Romanian political system is growing more and more uncontested by the day; a development appreciated by our great Captain, who ended up growing to be more of a politician than a combatant like back in the day. We should continue our efforts to further legitimise ourselves and carve a niche for the Movement that will stand the test of time."
 ROM_green-tinted_democracy: "Green-Tinted Democracy?"
 ROM_green-tinted_democracy_desc: "While different from our previous goal of uncontested rule, we have managed to turn our surprising victory into a chance to permanently leave our mark within the Romanian political system, and ensure a permanent niche for us no matter what may come in the future. Our country shall shine as bright as the sun in the sky, and we will achieve this most noble goal, whether it be via noble means or otherwise."

 ROM_green_prince_stands_up2_desc: "우리의 총애 받는 선장은 루마니아를 새로운 미래로 인도할 책임을 우리에게 넘겨주었고, 확고한 통제가 필요했습니다. 다행히, 적당한 때에 적당한 사람이 일어나 군단과 국가에 대한 통제를 회복하는 데 성공했습니다. 이제, 루마니아가 필요로 했던 확고한 통제, 알렉산드루 칸타쿠지노의 철권이 루마니아를 다스릴 것입니다."
 ROM_legionary_revolution: "The Legionary Revolution"
 ROM_legionary_revolution_desc: "[cantacuzino2desc]"
 ROM_legionary_revolution1_desc: "As venerable as our Captain was, his attempt to adherence to the old party system led to his murder by his opponents. It was by calling back to our past as a revolutionary cell that we have reasserted control, and now we are in a position to truly unleash our own revolution. With both the Old Guard and the Worker Corps rallied behind the Conducâtor and Regent, no infighting shall distract us from our sacred mission."
 ROM_legionary_revolution2_desc: "As venerable as our Captain was, his attempt to adherence to the old party system led to his retirement and failure. It was by calling back to our past as a revolutionary cell that we have reasserted control, and now we are in a position to truly unleash our own revolution. With both the Old Guard and the Worker Corps rallied behind the Conducâtor and Regent, no infighting shall distract us from our sacred mission."
 ROM_send_out_the_greenshirts: "녹색 셔츠를 보내라"
 ROM_send_out_the_greenshirts_desc: "We have made great strides to bring back order, however rebellious elements still threaten our rule. Fortunately, our ever-loyal Greenshirts stand at the ready to help us quell insurrections, and with some training and extra measures, they will perform. A simple signature is all we need to show just who actually rules these streets."
 ROM_national_brotherhood_focus: "국가적 형제애"
 ROM_national_brotherhood_focus_desc: "For the longest time we have been divided by various barriers, and although the Unification and measures taken since have helped bring them down, work remains to be done to finally end brotherly conflicts. By highlighting our shared past, our present chance and our future glories, we will help instil a sense of true brotherhood amongst our people, and no Romanian shall be a stranger to the other anymore."
 ROM_oust_the_foreign_monarch: "외세 군주 축출"
 ROM_oust_the_foreign_monarch_desc: "Although the Monarchy has helped us build our nation, lingering foreign elements within the Royal house still remain. Even the king that was born here has worked against us, we now have no choice but to replace the foreign dynasty. Conducâtor Cantacuzino has sworn to fullfill his duty as the Regent until fitting new monarch is chosen."
 ROM_romanian_of_tomorrow: "내일의 루마니아"
 ROM_romanian_of_tomorrow_desc: "Over time, people become complacent. Fortunately, our gracious Conducâtor Cantacuzino knows just what must be done and what traits to foster to maintain the Romanian people's real fighting spirit. As much as we will respect our past, we must rediscover it and always challenge ourselves, and end the apathy and deceitfulness that plagued us for so long. In the name of King, Cross and People, we shall prevail."
 ROM_vanguard_of_reaction: "The Vanguard of Reaction"
 ROM_vanguard_of_reaction_desc: "It is not enough to simply reshape our country out of obligation towards ourselves; we have to commit to forging the Romania of tomorrow to ensure our place as a leading nation in history, a beacon of nationalism, of heroic revolutionary spirit and of Christianity. Admirers and imitators will come in time, just as France became a beacon following the conquests of Napoleon."
 ROM_end_unjust_privileges: "부당 특권 종료"
 ROM_end_unjust_privileges_desc: "Legionaries are an example to the Romanian people in their brotherhood unlike the bourgeoisie of the past who, as they fetishised old France, detached themselves from the realities of the land. This combined with materialism are ruining our moral fibre and this cannot do. Let he who is truly useful to his kin become the respected one, not the wealthy one, and let the unshackling of the Romanians begin."
 ROM_break_the_banks: "은행 분쇄"
 ROM_break_the_banks_desc: "The dominance of speculative capital chokes our spirit and helps engender desires of a soft life, without difficulties and without helping to contribute to anything. No longer! The time has come to finally shatter this chokehold it has on us and return honest work to the ennobling effect it was always supposed to have, and re-entrench the true rights and social duties of wealth."
 ROM_we_shall_raise_ourselves: "우리 스스로 성장할 것이다"
 ROM_we_shall_raise_ourselves_desc: "Now that we are free from foreign rule, be it Ottoman, Austrian or Russian, it falls onto us and us alone to steer our own fate. Through our very own effort we shall not only rediscover that spirit which helped us survive all this time, but also elevate ourselves among the ruling peoples of Europe! No longer shall we be the servants of any trespassers; we will lord over them ourselves!"
 ROM_cult_of_the_warrior: "The Cult of the Warrior"
 ROM_cult_of_the_warrior_desc: "Intellectualism, although necessary in some regards, is not the most ideal way of life for us, for it begets cowardice and chokes out bravery. No, in order to properly defend our home and achieve our sacred destiny we have to rediscover the virtues of our defenders of old; simplicity, physical improvement and the shedding of excessive rationalism in favour of heroic mysticism."
 ROM_national_legionary_state: "The National-Legionary State"
 ROM_national_legionary_state_desc: "There still remains much to be done, but with the foundations laid down and the basic framework established, we can properly proclaim the National-Legionary State and cement our gains for now, and prepare for the next steps in our transformation of the psyche and of the nation. Long Live the Legion, the Captain and the Conducâtor! Onwards, dear brothers! Onwards to victory!"
 ROM_carlist_restoration: "카롤주의 유신"
 ROM_carlist_restoration_desc: "His Majesty, Carol II, has emerged victorious in his duel with the so-called \"Captain\". With Codreanu out of the way, the king may now proceed with His plan to restore His rightful place in the Romanian Nation. Long live the king!"
 ROM_the_remaining_legionaries: "Find Remaining Legionaries"
 ROM_the_remaining_legionaries_desc: "While the Legion has effectively collapsed, far too many high-profile Legionaries remain at large and, therefore, a threat to the government. We must eliminate the dangerous ones and purge the rest for their crimes against the nation."
 ROM_reward_the_loyal: "충성에 보상을"
 ROM_reward_the_loyal_desc: "In these dire times with treason widespread, it is important to keep in mind those who have remained loyal to His Majesty during the toughest hour. Rewards are plenty to those who remained steadfast just as punishment is dealt to those who betrayed Us."
 ROM_carol_constitution: "흠정헌법의 초안 작성"
 ROM_carol_constitution_desc: "The last few years have only demonstrated that the current constitution is incredibly flawed. No longer will demagogues like Codreanu be able to sway the public; the king, and only the king, will lead the nation. Although Parliament remains, with senators appointed by His Majesty and deputies reorganised along corporatist lines, executive and legislative power is vested in the king."
 ROM_carol_const_tt: "Drafting of the Royal Constitution will begin."
 ROM_royal_philantrophy_focus: "왕실 자선사업"
 ROM_royal_philantrophy_focus_desc: "As the nation rebuilds itself, the king, as saviour of the nation, must be at the forefront of philanthropic endeavours throughout the country. This is needed not only to restore His Majesty's reputation, but to help repair the fabric of society torn by manipulative demagogues and incompetent politicians."
 ROM_nrf: "National Renaissance Front"
 ROM_nrf_desc: "National unity has been shattered by the last few years of incompetence, driven by the selfish interests of political parties and demagogues. The division caused by parties can only be addressed by creating a single pro-government political group to replace the broken system of parties. The National Renaissance Front will serve as the king's political vehicle to rebuild and modernise Romania."
 ROM_cult_of_personality: "개인숭배"
 ROM_cult_of_personality_desc: "It is not enough to cultivate a positive image of the king. He must be elevated further as the unchallenged Conducâtor of the nation. His Majesty's true power must be reflected everywhere to ensure the government's legitimacy and strength in the eyes of the public and keep the nation's wounds from resurfacing."
 ROM_crown_patronage: "왕실 후원"
 ROM_crown_patronage_desc: "His Majesty is an unapologetic lover of the arts and large sums are spent subsidising cultural projects- especially if they serve to improve the king's image. While he has little interest in economics, his advisors are able men, and they suggest continuing large state-run development projects throughout the country, which only helps cultivate his philanthropic image."
 ROM_corporatism: "Corporate Alliances"
 ROM_corporatism_desc: "While corporatism is an important aspect of His Majesty's government, corporate interests are also undeniably crucial in developing the country. Aligning with Romania's largest corporations will ensure that we have the powerful backing of the wealthy industrialists and investors in the state's many development projects everywhere."
 ROM_empowered_camarilla: "The Camarilla Empowered"
 ROM_empowered_camarilla_desc: "The King of Romania has always had an informal network of councillors and advisors. This Camarilla, however, never became an actual institution with actual powers. With the king firmly in control, this must change, and the king's privy council will finally make it official, further cementing His Majesty's power."
 ROM_an_idealized_sovereign: "이상화된 국왕"
 ROM_an_idealized_sovereign_desc: "As part of His Majesty's cult of personality, an idealised image of the king is one of the more important aspects. The king must be depicted in a way that truly shows his power and his God-appointed mission to lead the Romanian people, and the nation should venerate their Saviour-King as He brings forth a golden age for them."
 ROM_reshaping_the_country: "국가 개조"
 ROM_reshaping_the_country_desc: "As Romania enters a golden age, the country will inevitably be reshaped as it becomes a modern nation. Romanians will be better connected than ever before as railroads and highways bring people and goods to and from each corner of the nation. They will symbolise the kingdom's ascendancy to prosperity."
 ROM_long_live_the_king: "부활의 왕"
 ROM_long_live_the_king_desc: "His Majesty Carol II has many titles. From Conducâtor to King of Culture, perhaps his favourite one is \"King of Rebirth\" as Romania enters an unprecedented golden age. Under his leadership, Romania will attain new highs as a beacon of prosperity in a harsh, troubled region of Europe."
 ROM_railroad_effort: "New National Veins"
 ROM_railroad_effort_desc: "As our nation heals from years of internal political friction we are now building new connections between our people both ideologically and physically to bridge the gaps and truly unite our people."
 ROM_michael: "미하이의 정부"
 ROM_michael_desc: "The Royal-Legionary Conflict has led the nation to complete ruin as the two leaders let their squabble turn into senseless murder. With the Autocrat and the Captain gone, it is up to the young king and the army to pick up the pieces and rebuild Romania. Once the generals stabilise the situation, the old politicians will return, and free elections will decide the nation's future once more."
 ROM_PNL_victory: "국민자유당의 귀환"
 ROM_PNL_victory_desc: "The National Liberal Party, Romania's oldest political party, makes its triumphant return on the political scene. With the Legion and the ambitious Carol II swept away, it will be up to us National Liberals to rebuild our nation and democracy."
 ROM_PNL_through_us_ourselves: "우리 스스로를 통해서"
 ROM_PNL_through_us_ourselves_desc: "\"Prin Noi Înşine!\" is our party's motto; the Romanian nation can achieve prosperity only through our own hard work. We will make our nation as self-sufficient as possible by developing our own industry."

 ROM_PNL_centralization: "중앙집권"
 ROM_PNL_centralization_desc: "Romania is one nation and the demands of regionalists and decentralists are tantamount to separatism and, thus, treason. Power must be in the hands of the central government, for only they know and understand the bigger picture; the nation itself in its entirety."
 ROM_PNL_economic_integration: "경제적 통합"
 ROM_PNL_economic_integration_desc: "Romania has been disconnected for too long, its main historic regions developing largely independently of each other. This can no longer be the case, for the nation must be truly unified. Integrating the Romanian economy into a single unit will strengthen the central government's influence and its ability to develop the nation as a whole."
 ROM_PNL_bratianu: "Legacy of the Brātianu Family"
 ROM_PNL_bratianu_desc: "The PNL has been largely dominated by the Brătianu family and the majority of party chairmen were scions. This monopoly has long been criticised and caused factionalism within the party. However, despite their initial exclusion, it is high time for us to address the elephant in the room, for Dinu Brătianu is eager to help the National Liberal effort, which could prove beneficial."
 ROM_PNL_rebranding: "쇄신과 재조직"
 ROM_PNL_rebranding_desc: "When the Legion seized power, they were eager to paint the National Liberals as the source of Romania's troubles since the Great War. Their propaganda has proven to be long-lasting and it will time for us to rebuild our image among the Romanian people."
 ROM_PNL_national_revival: "루마니아의 부활"
 ROM_PNL_national_revival_desc: "The National Liberal Party has always embraced Romanian nationalism along with its liberal ideals. With the Romanian people reunified, the nation enters a new age, a new national revival as we celebrate our great achievements in recent history."

 ROM_PNL_constitution_desc: "The PNL is now introducing a new constitution. Democratic traditions are to be enshrined once more, and its articles reflect the party's liberal and nationalist ideals. In the future, Romania will be able to call itself a stable and prosperous nation with its liberties and interests protected."
 ROM_PNT_victory: "국민농민당의 승리"
 ROM_PNT_victory_desc: "The union of the Peasant's Party and the Transylvania-based Romanian National Party has created a powerful political bloc; the National Peasant's Party (PNT). Their triumph in the general elections are a surprise; perhaps the minds across the Carpathians can finally bring much-needed new blood and ideas to Romanian politics after the fiasco of the Legionary government."
 ROM_PNT_open_doors_policy: "문호개방정책"
 ROM_PNT_open_doors_policy_desc: "The Open Doors Policy has been proposed by the PNT to attract foreign capital to invest in industrial development, believing that Romania alone simply doesn't have the capital to support economic development at the scale needed to compete with the rest of Europe."
 ROM_PNT_rural_banks: "은행 협력"
 ROM_PNT_rural_banks_desc: "Cooperative banking such as credit unions has been a relatively recent development in more agrarian economies. These largely-rural institutions are far better suited to deal with the realities of Romania, with its population overwhelmingly composed of peasants. This way, we can better develop the economies of rural Romania and ensure that the majority of Romanians will profit from economic growth rather than just the urban elites."
 ROM_PNT_developmentalism: "개발주의"
 ROM_PNT_developmentalism_desc: "Developmentalism is the economic theory that less developed economies should focus on building up a varied internal market, largely through moderate interventionism and limited imports. The PNT hopes to achieve a moderate programme of industrialisation to diversify and strengthen the economy."
 ROM_PNT_limited_dirigism: "통제정책 최소화"
 ROM_PNT_limited_dirigism_desc: "While both laissez-faire and planned economies have proven to have many strengths and weaknesses, the PNT believes in a moderate course with the government intervening through limited state planning largely \"directing\" a market economy."
 ROM_PNT_peasant_state: "농민 국가를 향하여"
 ROM_PNT_peasant_state_desc: "Peasants make up the vast majority of the population. It is only natural that the government should focus on improving their livelihoods first and foremost. Thus, as representatives of the peasant class, the PNT will transform Romania into a \"peasant state\" that will truly work for their interests."
 ROM_PNT_cooperatives: "협동조합 지원"
 ROM_PNT_cooperatives_desc: "For peasants, cooperatives are the natural way to organise the rural population and economy, for they will only rarely leave their communities. It is through cooperatives that the peasants will truly prosper in an improved economy."
 ROM_PNT_office_of_regional_development: "Create the Office of Regional Development"
 ROM_PNT_office_of_regional_development_desc: "By founding the Office of Regional Development, the government will be better able to judge and address the economic problems of Romania's different regions. Through them, investments will be directed where it is needed to improve local economies."
 ROM_PNT_community_of_producers: "The Community of Producers"
 ROM_PNT_community_of_producers_desc: "The \"Community of Producers\" is Virgil Madgearu's economic and political doctrine to address the ever-growing divide among social classes. To him, Labour must dominate Capital and not vice-versa to create a harmonious society; rural, urban, and intellectual labourers should all be collaborators in production to achieve economic self-sufficiency to this end."
 ROM_PNT_protect_little_man: "보통 사람 보호"
 ROM_PNT_protect_little_man_desc: "Iuliu Maniu is a man of the people. The Little Man, the peasant and the industrial worker, must be protected from the country's economic and political elite which seek to enslave him. The oligarchy of Old Romania has already led the nation to ruin once, and cannot be allowed to do so again."
 ROM_PNT_rural_gendarme: "시골의 경찰"
 ROM_PNT_rural_gendarme_desc: "Both Legionnaires and Syndicalists have proven law and order must be preserved in order to protect the people, vulnerable to their intimidation tactics and demagoguery. The rural gendarme will become the symbol of stability in Greater Romania."
 ROM_PNT_constitution: "Draft a Peasant Constitution"
 ROM_PNT_constitution_desc: "With the PNT having secured the support of the Romanian people, a new constitution is to be promulgated. Democratic institutions are to be protected once more while Romania's peasants, the vast majority of the population, will be guaranteed its central position in Romanian society. Romania will indeed become a Peasant State which truly seeks the best for its people."

 romania.3.t: "독일 기업의 국유화"
 romania.3.d: "As German banks collapsed, so did the German corporations owning large parts of the Romanian oil industry. The exports-based economy of Romania crashed hard after the demand for oil and agricultural products hit rock bottom in the Reichspakt, which has been Romania's main trading partner. Unemployment soared sky-high in a fortnight, and our largest bank is on the precipice of collapse.\n\nWhile most non-syndicalist countries simply have to endure the collapse, our government holds a significant control over the economic system. Should we desire so, we could obtain the assets of crashed German corporations quite cheaply and nationalise the refinery industry, saving thousands of Romanian jobs in the process. This might not be a popular move in Berlin, however, but it would send a strong message about Codreanu's government and its dedication to the well-being of all Romanians."

The government proposes state-funding of relief work in Iron Guard-administrated labour corps, while the king wishes to support private industrialists to provide relief jobs.

The Superior Banking Council was created to regulate and investigate the banking sector in 1934, and the institution has never been more necessary. While banks in many countries crashed hard and fast, a total collapse of Banca de Credit Roman was prevented through the SBC safeguards. The catastrophe that broke the backs of great, international German banks left the Romanian ones surprisingly unharmed."
 romania.5.a: "훌륭해!"
 romania.6.t: "루마니아의 미래"
 romania.6.d: "1936년의 해가 시작되면서 나라의 두 경쟁 관계의 지도자인 카롤 2세와 코드레아누 총리 사이의 투쟁은 새로운 국면으로 접어들었습니다. 한동안 교착 상태에 빠진 두 사람은 자유롭게 상대방을 조종하는 데 어려움을 겪고 있습니다. 두 사람이 정면으로 충돌하는 빈도가 높아지면서 협력을 유지하는 것은 점점 더 어려워지고 있습니다. 이제 국왕과 선장은 모두 상대방을 영원히 제명시킬 때가 다가왔음을 깨닫고 있습니다. 두 사람이 충돌하는 동안 사람들은 점점 더 한쪽을 택할 것을 강요받거나, 아니면 중립을 지킨 대가에 직면하게 될 것입니다."
 romania.6.a: "I will stand by Codreanu and his Legionaries."
 romania.6.b: "Carol II is the rightful ruler of all Romania!"
 romania.68.t: "오랫동안 기다려 왔던 토지개혁"
 romania.68.d1: "벨트크리크 이후 루마니아에서는 토지 소유권에 대한 종합적인 개혁을 실시하려는 시도가 여러 차례 있었습니다. 아마도 불평등한 토지 소유권을 해결하려던 가장 야심찬 시도는 1934년의 군단 토지개혁이었을 것입니다. 이 개혁은 부유한 귀족들이 국왕에게 개입을 요청하면서 중단되었습니다. 이번에는 코드레아누 총리가 대규모의 토지를 분할해 농지를 실제 경작민들에게 나누어 주는 계획을 관철시키기 위해 나섰습니다. 이 넓은 땅들은 루마니아의 모든 경작지의 반 이상을 차지합니다.\n\n귀족들은 코드레아누의 개혁에 대해 꽤나 걱정스러워합니다. 그리고 이미 왕에게 개혁을 중단하거나 최소한으로 완화해 달라고 여러 번 호소했습니다. 국왕은 의회가 통과시키는 어떠한 법도 거부할 수 있는 권력을 행사하고 있기 때문에 그의 의견과 영향력을 무시할 수는 없습니다. 그가 실제로 개혁을 저지할 것이라고 상상하긴 어렵지만, 이 20세기 루마니아 경제에서 가장 큰 구조조정에서 국왕은 자신의 계획도 여기에 포함시킬 것을 목표로 하고 있을 것입니다."
 romania.68.d2: "벨트크리크 이후 루마니아에서는 토지 소유권에 대한 종합적인 개혁을 실시하려는 시도가 여러 차례 있었습니다. 아마도 불평등한 토지 소유권을 해결하려던 가장 야심찬 시도는 1934년의 군단 토지개혁이었을 것입니다. 이 개혁은 부유한 귀족들이 국왕에게 개입을 요청하면서 중단되었습니다. 카롤 2세는 귀족들의 권리를 보호해 주었지만, 또한 그의 본색도 코드레아누에게 보여주었습니다.\n\n그러나 토지개혁은 여전히 필요한 것입니다. 루마니아 시골에서의 토지 이용 실태는 불평등하고 비효율적입니다. 거대 영지를 해체하려는 군단과는 달리 왕은 그런 잔인한 방법을 쓸 수는 없습니다. 대신 정부는 토지 소유자들에게 대항하지 않고 협력하는 것을 목표로 해야 합니다. 그러나 실질적인 입법권은 군단의 손에 달려 있습니다. 그들은 이것을 통해 개혁 과정에 자신들의 영향력을 어느 정도 줄 것을 요구할 것입니다."
 romania.68.a: "이 땅의 농민들에 대한 우리의 의무이다."
 romania.10.t: "카마릴라의 이중 간첩!"
 romania.10.d: "국왕의 비공식 추밀원인 카마릴라에는 그의 지지자들과 조언가들이 가득 차 있습니다. 한편 왕을 둘러싼 사교계의 크기는 상당히 넓기에 철위대가 여기에 침투하는 것은 시간문제였습니다. 이 이중 간첩을 제때 처리하지 못한다면 그들은 획득한 정보를 바탕으로 카마릴라의 일원이 연루된 스캔들을 일으킬 수도 있습니다."
 romania.10.a: "왕실 스캔들이 폭로되었다!"
 romania.10.b: "그를 침묵시켜라."
 romania.11.t: "길거리에서의 폭력 사태!"
 romania.11.d: "군단이 의회 활동을 엄격히 통제하고 있지만, 정치 판도 너머 코드레아누에 대한 저항은 절대 누그러뜨릴 수 없었습니다. 오늘 아침 운동가들이 거리로 뛰쳐나오자 코드레아누의 녹색 셔츠단이 그들을 덮치면서 폭력 사태가 발생했습니다. 그들의 지도자가 이것을 지시했는지는 확실치 않지만, 우리는 싸움을 모른 척 한채 철위대가 반체제 인사들을 진압하게 놔두거나, 녹색 셔츠단과 싸우기 위해 보안군을 출동시켜야 합니다."

 romania.11.b: "놈들이 전투를 원한다면 소원대로 해주지!"
 romania.12.t: "코드레아누의 대중주의 정책들"
 romania.12.d: "군단이 의회의 대부분을 장악한 가운데 코드레아누 총리가 국민 회의에 입법안을 제출했습니다. 이 실체가 거의 없는 법안에는 선장의 토지개혁 프로그램에 대한 국민의 지지를 얻고자 하는 의도가 깔려 있다는 것이 의원들 사이에서는 공공연한 비밀입니다. 카롤 2세의 카마릴라는 코드레아누의 이러한 노골적인 선동에 불안해하며 왕에게 법안에 거부권을 행사라고 제안하고 있지만, 그렇게 하는 것은 많은 국민들 사이에서 그의 지지도에 타격을 줄 것입니다. 그 대신 국왕이 영향력을 행사하거나 총리에게 압력을 가해 공로를 국왕에게 돌림으로써 왕실의 이미지 개선에 도움을 줄 수 있다는 제안도 나왔습니다."
 romania.12.a: "법안을 수용해라."

 romania.12.c: "원하는 법안만 통과시켜라."
 romania.13.t: "코드레아누가 검열을 강화하다"
 romania.13.d: "반대파를 침묵시키기 위한 또 다른 움직임으로, 반대파 소속의 한 신문은 인쇄를 시작하기 전 철위대에 의해 강제로 폐간되었습니다. 그들은 이 신문사가 명예훼손적인 출판물을 출판한 이력이 있다고 주장했습니다. 선장은 언론이 \"성숙\"해지기 전까지 그들의 거짓말로부터 루마니아인들을 보호하기 위해 검열법을 강화해야 한다고 주장했습니다."
 romania.13.a: "적어도 반대파가 좀 조용해지겠지."
 romania.13.b: "대신 당 내부 언론에 집중해라."
 romania.14.t: "대규모 군단 집회!"
 romania.14.d: "대천사 미카엘 군단은 수천 명의 지지자들을 모으는 대규모 집회로 자긍심을 느낍니다. 하지만 이 집회는 노골적인 반대유대주의적 언사를 담은 격렬한 연설과 국가의 적들에 대한 폭력적인 해결책을 요구하고 있습니다. 게다가 왕은 이것들을 경쟁자에게의 권력 과시이자 그의 통치에 대한 노골적인 위협으로 여기고 있습니다. 물론 카롤 왕은 코드레아누에게 왕실의 관대함을 베풀어서 국왕을 중앙에 세워서 행진을 허락하거나, 아니면 전부 다 금지시킬 수도 있습니다. 하지만 이것은 군단과 그들의 악명 높은 녹색 셔츠단의 격노를 초래할 가능성이 있습니다."
 romania.14.a: "이 얄팍한 모임을 금지시켜라."
 romania.14.b: "허락해라... 약간의 대가만 치러 준다면야."
 romania.15.t: "The King Appears in Public"
 romania.15.d: "카롤 왕은 종종 국가의 두 지도자의 통합을 보여주기 위해 코드레아누 총리와 함께 대중 앞에 모습을 나타내곤 했습니다. 그러나 최근 들어 왕은 선장에게 통보 없이 즉흥적으로 혼자서 대중 앞에 나타나기 시작했습니다. 이는 분명 카롤이 군단으로부터 독립된 개인 지지 기반을 구축하려는 것이 분명하며 이는 곧 코드레아누에 대한 위협이나 다름없습니다. 우리는 겉보기에는 단합한 것처럼 보여야 할 필요가 있기 때문에 국왕이 혼자 행군하도록 내버려 두거나, 아니면 카롤의 이기적인 행동이 그들의 협력을 방해한다는 이유로 항의에 나서야 합니다."
 romania.15.a: "그가 원하는 것이라면 대중을 즐겁게 해주라지."
 romania.15.b: "그의 결정에 대해 항의해라."
 romania.16.t: "장교단의 왕당파 공모자들"
 romania.16.d: "루마니아 왕립군은 비록 내부에 카롤 2세와 코드레아누의 지지자들을 가지고는 있었지만 두 사람의 투쟁으로부터 항상 중립을 유지해 왔습니다. 그러나 많은 장교들이 국왕에 대해 점점 더 노골적인 충성심을 보이면서 그들이 코드레아누에 대항하여 군의 지지를 얻으려고 노력하고 있다는 것이 분명해졌습니다. 이 왕실의 음모가 걷잡을 수 없이 커지기 전에, 우리는 참모부를 설득하여 이 왕당파 떠벌이들을 처벌해야 할지도 모릅니다. 그러나 코드레아누는 군사 문제에 개입하는 것을 경계하고 있습니다. 그는 그들이 얼마나 간섭받는 것을 경멸하고, 또 정치에 대해 얼마나 냉담한 태도를 가지고 있는 알고 있기 때문입니다."
 romania.16.a: "가혹한 처벌을 내려라."
 romania.16.b: "우린 군과의 관계를 좋게 유지해야 한다."
 romania.17.t: "고위 계층과 만나는 국왕"
 romania.17.d: "왕 카롤 2세는 루마니아 상류 사회의 활발한 회원입니다. 부유한 실업가부터 예술가, 사회인까지 그는 그들을 개인적으로나 재정적으로 지원하는 경향이 있고, 그들은 왕의 지원을 높이 평가합니다. 그들 중 많은 사람들은 왕을 직접 만나서 그들이 필요로 하는 어떤 문제나 프로젝트에 대한 그의 의견을 듣고 싶어합니다. 반면, 코드레아누 총리는 루마니아 정부의 복잡한 관계에서 자신의 입지를 위협할 수 있는 이러한 만남들을 경계해왔습니다. 그는 이러한 만남을 제한하고 루마니아의 고위 계층의 의견이 자신에게 불리하게 작용하지 않도록 하기 위해 영향력을 사용할 수 있습니다."
 romania.17.a: "그들이 왕을 만날 수 있게 해라."
 romania.17.b: "어쩌면 왕은 지금은 좀 바쁠지도 모른다."
 romania.18.t: "철위대 내부 분열"
 romania.18.d: "The Legion of Archangel Michael, or Iron Guard, has become a powerful mass movement with a huge following. Despite strict ideological discipline, however, the Guard is not monolithic and it increasingly faces non-conformism within its wide membership. These non-conformist tendencies, be they towards radicalism or moderatism, have allowed the king to exploit divisions within the movement leading some young, outspoken Legionnaires to criticise the Legion's leadership. That these dissidents will be punished is a certainty, but the degree of said punishment is not - Codreanu may not wish to advertise this dissidence in the Legion or alienate younger members whose support remains tentative."
 romania.18.a: "순응하지 않는 자들을 처벌해라."
 romania.18.b: "그들은 아직 젊다. 차차 배워나갈 것이다."
 romania.19.t: "반 군단 프로파간다"
 romania.19.d: "최근 전국에 걸쳐서 코드레아누와 군단에 대한 선동을 일삼는 신문이 생겨나고 있습니다. 녹색 셔츠단이 그들을 폐쇄하려 했을 때 그들은 국왕의 보호를 받는 사람들의 명단이 적힌 종이를 발견했으며, 그들이 밀어붙이려 들 때는 왕의 무장 단체들의 매복에 당했습니다. 당분간은 루마니아 전역에 정부에 대항하는 프로파간다가 성공적으로 퍼질 것으로 보입니다."
 romania.19.a: "망할 놈의 왕 같으니라고!"
 romania.20.t: "군단노동자군"
 romania.20.d: "군단노동자군은 코드레아누가 생디칼리스트들과 그의 지지자들을 그의 초국가주의 운동의 공동 협력자들로 만드려는 시도의 결과입니다. 본질적으로 군단은 노동조합을 대체하려는 철위대와 유사한 엄격한 계층의 루마니아 노동자들의 연합체이다. 노동자와 사업주의 평등을 목표로 한다고는 주장하지만, 이는 더 많은 도시 노동자들을 대규모로 군단에 끌어들여 군단 운동을 지원하는 또 다른 준군사 단체로 동원하려는 시도입니다."
 romania.20.a: "붉은 연맹보다는 녹색 연합이 낫다!"
 romania.20.b: "우리는 그들의 영향력을 제한해야만 한다."
 romania.21.t: "세력을 넓히는 철위대"
 romania.21.d: "최근 코드레아누의 성공과 대중주의적 언사 덕분에 대천사 미카엘 군단의 지지자 수가 급증했습니다. 그의 움직임은 선장의 선동에 관계없이 루마니아인들에게 더 매력적인 것이 분명하며, 그 과정에서 국왕의 명성과 인기에 타격을 줄 것은 명백합니다."
 romania.21.a: "망할 자식들!"
 romania.22.t: "보복주의자 집회"
 romania.22.d: "보복주의는 루마니아 정치에서 영구적인 신념이 되었습니다. 어떤 정치 운동도 온건파이든 급진파든 간에 상관없이 피할 수 없는 존재이며 그것을 반대하는 것은 \"반역자\"로 인식되어 정치인들에게 끔찍한 결과를 초래했습니다. 최근 몇 년 동안 철위대는 루마니아의 보복주의를 대표해 왔고 그들의 미사여구에 뻔뻔스럽게 기름을 붓는 데 사용했습니다. 그 때문에 보복주의자들의 집회는 그들이 번성할 수 있었던 군단과 밀접하게 연관되어 있습니다. 이러한 집회를 제지하는 것은 비록 그것이 철위대의 영향력과 침투를 제한할 수 있다 하더라도 비용이 많이 들고 지지를 얻기 어렵게 될 것입니다."
 romania.22.a: "조국을 위한 모든 것!"
 romania.22.b: "선동가들을 제지할 필요가 있다."
 romania.23.t: "급증하는 십자기 형제단"
 romania.23.d: "십자가 형제단은 대천사 미카엘 군단의 청소년 단체이며 루마니아 청소년들 사이에서 점점 더 유명세를 얻게 되었습니다. 최근 이들의 회원 수가 급증했는데, 이는 수많은 모집과 국가 지원 이후 사람들 사이에서 널리 퍼졌다는 것을 의미할 것입니다. 전국의 형제단은 군단이 성장할 수 있도록 돕고 있으며, 군단이 그들이 향후 철위대에 들어올 수 있도록 보장하고 향후 운동의 핵심을 조직함에 따라 장기적으로는 반드시 필요한 것으로 판명될 것입니다."

 romania.24.d: "카마릴라는 비공식적인 조직이지만, 카롤 2세는 카마릴라를 공식 정부 기관으로 만들기 위해 꾸준히 그것을 강화하고 있습니다. 지금 당장은 이 조그마한 의회의 실질적인 영향력은 제한되어 있기에 코드레아누는 이를 용인할 수 있지만, 우리가 이것이 더 오래 존재하도록 내버려둔다면 그들을 계속 주시하는 것이 현명할 것입니다."
 romania.24.a: "봉건 군주 놀이를 하게 내버려 두라지."
 romania.24.b: "이 남자는 코드레아누에게 위협이 된다."
 romania.25.t: "Carol II's Philanthropy"
 romania.25.d: "In a clear attempt at improving his poor image, King Carol donated large sums of money to numerous charities across the country. Hoping the create an image as a generous philanthropist, the king made sure that news of these donations were made very public and spread through Royalist papers. While we could simply ignore the king's blatant challenge, we could also try to outshine him by publicly increasing state expenditures towards charities and services."
 romania.25.a: "Let him spend his unjust wealth."
 romania.25.b: "Show them that the state cares too!"
 romania.26.t: "King Tours the Countryside"
 romania.26.d: "As the king continues to improve his abysmal public image, his recent tours have led him to the Romanian countryside where he has made many public gatherings and speeches exalting Romanian farmers and inspecting results from the land reform programme. We could simply ignore the king's pathetic attempt at wooing our support base and not allow it to gain even more attention, but it may be wise to counter it and make sure Romanians are reminded of who truly cares about their well-being."
 romania.26.a: "He should stay there!"
 romania.26.b: "Show the farmers who truly cares about them."
 romania.26.c: "The Legion must not forget its roots!"
 romania.27.t: "Straja Tarii Founded"
 romania.27.d: "The Sentinel of the Motherland is the youth wing of the Royalist movement meant to counter the growing strength of the Legion's own Cross Brotherhoods. Sentinels are bound by a creed: Faith and Labour for Country and King. Like the Cross Brotherhoods, the Sentinel offers military training for Romania's youth, forming them as loyal patriots of the nation and its King, the \"Great Sentinel\". While we will be unable to discern its success for some time, what is clear is that the two youth movements are bound to clash should the king and Codreanu split."
 romania.27.a: "What misguided young patriots."
 romania.28.t: "야당 정치인의 암살!"
 romania.28.d: "야권의 정치인이 그의 집에 침입한 암살자들에 의해 총격을 당하고 오늘 아침 시체로 발견되었습니다. 군단과 왕당파 모두 반체제인사의 죽음에 딱히 분개해 하지는 않지만, 두 진영 모두 자신들의 이익을 위해 이 기회를 이용하고자 분주히 움직이고 있습니다. 왕당파는 암살자들을 처벌하고 적법한 절차에 대한 자신들의 존중을 표하고자 하고, 군단은 정치적 경쟁자들을 더욱 약화시키기 위해 대규모 체포를 준비하고 있습니다."
 romania.28.a: "정말 안됐군."

 romania.29.d: "철위대가 유명해지고 그 숫자가 증가함에 따라 불법 무장 단체들의 폭력사태가 점점 더 흔해지고 있습니다. 코드레아누가 총리가 된 이후 정치적 항의 시위가 가라앉을 기미가 보이진 않지만, 다른 어떤 정치 집단도 그들을 야만적이라고 말할 수 없었는데 이는 군단의 철위대와 그들의 반체제 인사들에 대한 공격은 보안군이 개입하지 않는 한(그리고 대체로 그러지 않았기 때문에) 보통 일방적이었기 때문입니다. 그들의 폭력을 멈추고 무장한 사람들을 해산시키는 것은 비록 거리의 평화에 기여한다 하더라도 비용이 많이 드는 일이 될 것입니다. 게다가, 그들의 폭력은 왕과 정부 모두에 대한 반대 세력을 약화시키는 데도 도움이 되었습니다."

 romania.29.c: "나라의 영혼을 위한 전쟁이 길거리에서 승리했다!"
 romania.30.t: "Legionaries Attack Synagogues"
 romania.30.d: "Anti-Semitism is definitely not new in Romania and has been widespread for some time, but the Legion has brought it to previously-unimaginable levels. A common scapegoat in the past, Jewish Romanians have increasingly become targets as revanchist sentiments radicalised large segments of the Romanian population. With alarming regularity, Greenshirts attack synagogues throughout the country with security forces often turning a blind eye. As yet another anti-Semitic incident as occurred, it remains to be seen how the divided authorities will respond."
 romania.30.a: "There are always radicals."
 romania.30.b: "Punish those responsible."
 romania.31.t: "공장 노동자들의 파업"
 romania.31.d: "프랑스가 생디칼리슴에 물들면서 야기된 붉은 공포는 대부분 사라졌지만, 이후 루마니아 정부는 노동 운동이 싹트는 곳마다 재빨리 운동을 진압했습니다. 국가가 점점 산업화되면서 노동 분쟁이 증가했습니다. 대부분이 근로자나 파업 대체자로 일하는 사람들로 구성된 군단은 이 어떠한 종류의 \"생디칼리슴화\"에도 가혹하게 대처해 왔습니다. 부쿠레슈티의 공장 노동자들이 파업을 하겠다고 위협하는 가운데, 당국은 가만히 앉아서 철위대의 처리를 지켜만 보면 되는 상황입니다. 물론 위기 상황을 피하기 위해 협상에 나설 수도 있고, 혹은 단순히 노동자들이 포기할 때까지 기다릴 수도 있습니다."
 romania.31.a: "파업하도록 내버려 둬라."
 romania.31.b: "타협안에 대해 협상해라."
 romania.31.c: "그들을 모두 가혹하게 처벌해라!"
 romania.32.t: "Opposition Speaks against Codreanu"
 romania.32.d: "While Codreanu is prime minister with a comfortable majority in the Chamber of Deputies, it is by no means a monopoly of parliamentary activities. With Codreanu tightening censorship, unleashing his Greenshirts at any threat to his rule, and the king seemingly turning a blind eye to His Prime Minister's abuses, a gathering of opposition politicians have publicly criticised the Codreanu government's disregard for the Constitution. The demonstration remains relatively small as the Iron Guard keeps an eye on it, waiting for orders to disperse them."
 romania.32.a: "They do have a point."
 romania.32.b: "Silence them!"
 romania.61.t: "King's Mistress"
 romania.61.d: "The Romanian royal family, like every other, has a long history with extramarital affairs and marital infidelity. There is, however, an expectation of discretion: scandals are to be avoided and liaisons terminated should such a scandal occur. The king, however, not only appears to have no discretion whatsoever; indeed, he seems to take great pleasure in publicly flaunting his womanising lifestyle.\n\nThe origins of Elena \"Magda\" Lupescu are a source of confusion and debate. It is known that she inherited her Catholicism through her mother, who is a Jewish-born convert; her father, also Jewish-born, is an apothecary who converted to Eastern Orthodoxy. She was briefly married to a certain Lieutenant Ion Tampeanu, but divorced some time after the war. It is not known when she met the king, but she only started appearing alongside him after he was crowned and she quickly became one of his closest advisors.\n\nThe king has long been known as a playboy, but he has been acting differently with this recent mistress. Unlike his previous affairs, the relationship appears very strong, giving Magda significant, and apparently lasting, influence within Carol's inner circle. On the other hand, she has increasingly been targeted by opponents of King Carol as they try to weaken his position."
 romania.61.a: "It's not like the king can deny her anything."
 romania.61.b: "This is exactly the kind of degeneracy that will bring our nation into ruin!"
 romania.62.t: "Smear Campaign against Lupescu"
 romania.62.d: "The king's mistress, Magda Lupescu, has recently been targeted by Legion-aligned papers across Romania in a rather obvious attempt to smear her name. The exposé describes the \"Jewish whore\" as the power behind the throne, accusing her of manipulating Carol and subverting Codreanu's government, especially regarding his land reform programme. The Jewish origins of her parents are emphasised to further demonise her in the eyes of an increasingly anti-Semitic public and place her as a centrepiece of an anti-Romanian conspiracy. The king is absolutely livid to say the least and the campaign could very well cause a public split between him and his Prime Minister."
 romania.62.a: "How dare they? They must issue public apologies instantly!"
 romania.62.b: "Perhaps she should keep low profile for some time."
 romania.62.c: "What a mess they have caused."
 romania.63.t: "King Demands an Apology"
 romania.63.d: "As expected, King Carol II publicly admonished the Legion for their recent smear campaign against his mistress, Madame Lupescu. In retaliation, the king has demanded that Prime Minister Codreanu publicly apologise for the incident and properly punish the Legionaries responsible. While Codreanu has made little effort to hide his disgust of the mistress, he and the king depend on an image of cooperation in their common goal to forge Greater Romania and the incident threatens to expose how bitterly opposed they truly are. On the other hand, it would be a public humiliation for the Legion to bow down to Carol and could hurt the unity of the movement as the Captain depends on a strong cult of personality."
 romania.63.a: "Even if they are right, it is not their place to judge the king... yet."
 romania.63.b: "The Captain will always stand by his men!"
 romania.64.t: "Codreanu Sides with the King"
 romania.64.d: "In order to avoid a public dispute with the king, Codreanu agreed to his demands and publicly apologised for the Legion's attack on the king's mistress. This is a clear victory for Carol, but the Captain insists that relations with His Majesty need to remain smooth for the time being. He has promised to make sure the offenders will be tried and punished accordingly."
 romania.64.a: "Legionary tribunal will be enough!"
 romania.64.b: "This is beyond your little cult."
 romania.64.c: "It's not like there are any impartial courts in Romania anyway."
 romania.65.t: "Codreanu Stands by his Men"
 romania.65.d: "Unwilling to be humiliated by the king, the Captain refused to apologise, standing by his men's actions against Madame Lupescu. For now, the crisis continues, threatening stability and the fragile alliance between Legionaries and Royalists."
 romania.65.a: "It is our duty to tell the truth, even if the king does not like it."
 romania.65.b: "Suppress their publications."
 romania.66.t: "Codreanu Faces Criticism from his Own"
 romania.66.d: "While the Captain appears to be the all-powerful leader of the Iron Guard, there have been whispers among Legionaries about his submissive response to the Lupescu affair. While the Legion is highly-disciplined and the cult of personality centred around Codreanu is strong, the Captain's recent actions have shaken this once-absolute confidence. Regardless, Codreanu is adamant that this was the right course of action and that the alliance of convenience with the king is still necessary."
 romania.66.a: "We can never achieve Greater Romania if we keep bickering about some Jewish whore."
 romania.66.b: "Is it traitors I hear?"
 romania.66.c: "Let them bicker."
 romania.67.t: "Battle of the Wills"
 romania.67.d: "The crisis between King Carol II and Captain Codreanu has reached breaking point as it has spilled over into parliament. In the struggle between the two leaders over the Lupescu smear campaign, Carol finally threatened to sack Codreanu and replace him, prompting the Captain to finally give in to the king's demands. However, the damage has already been done, and both men claim victory over the other, for Codreanu was forced to stand down, but not without a fight for his men."
 romania.67.a: "Codreanu has to give in, for the sake of the nation."
 romania.67.b: "Pushing it further would just make the king look foolish."
 romania.70.t: "Danube is Ours Again"
 romania.70.d: "Despite the Treaty of Bucharest supposedly ensuring free access to the Black Sea, much of our economy has been strangled by Bulgarian control of the Danubian Delta, as the river is perhaps our most important trade route. Now that the southern enemy has been vanquished once more we can finally use the river to its full capability for moving goods and supplies without any Bulgarian involvement. We shall no longer be bound by the tyrannical Treaty in this matter. The Delta is rightful part of Romania, now and forever!"
 romania.70.a: "We shall never lose it again."

 romania.55.a: "We will miss them."
 romania.121.t: "Increase in Separatist Activity"
 romania.121.d: "It has came into our attention that Romanian government has started discreetly supplying Transylvanian separatists movements with arms and funding. While the Legionary government officially denies this, it is no surprise: their propaganda has called for conquest of Transylvania for years now. Our border guards and the police are well-equipped to handle these recent events, but we should be wary nonetheless. The madmen behind the Carpathians are surely plotting for our demise."
 romania.121.a: "We must keep an eye on this."
 ROM_HUN_transylvanian_resistance_tooltip: "§RResistance is enabled in Transylvania.§!"
 romania.122.t: "Arms Smuggling in Transylvania"
 romania.122.d: "We have captured a shipment of old Romanian rifles, smuggled into the country through distant Carpathian passes. Even though we have tightened the border controls, some shipments are bound to get through due to the disloyalty of the Transylvanian population. There's already numerous separatists active in the region, organising what can only be an armed revolt."
 romania.122.a: "Crack down on these criminals!"
 romania.56.t: "Unrest in Transylvania"
 romania.56.d: "For several decades, the Romanian population of eastern Hungary has been unhappy with our rule. As the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia united and secured their place as an independent state in the Balkans, many Transylvanians believe that their region is destined to be united with their brethren across the Carpathians regardless of our just, ancient historical claims over the region. During the Weltkrieg, Romania even attempted to take Transylvania by force, taking advantage of our weakness as we fought off the endless Russian hordes. Their defeat in the war has done little to weaken Romanian nationalism in the region.\n\nDespite the restrictions of the Treaty of Bucharest, the hostile regime in Bucharest has recently resumed propaganda efforts against us. Decrying our rule as tyrannical and oppressive, recent unrest in the cities of Arad, Kolozsvár and Nagyszeben have led to increased passive resistance against authorities. So far, the investigation has only found only ties with activists of the Romanian National Party (PNR), a legal party representing Romanian interests in Hungary, and not the hostile government in Bucharest. PNR leaders maintain that they wish to secure the autonomy of Transylvania and other Romanian-majority areas rather than separatism, claiming that they have no ties with the undemocratic regime in Bucharest."
 romania.56.a: "The gendarmerie will handle it."
 romania.57.t: "Iron Guard of Transylvania"
 romania.57.d: "The Legion of Archangel Michael, also known as the Iron Guard, is the ruling political movement in Romania. Its leader, \"Captain\" Codreanu, is a staunch Romanian nationalist and has not only openly defied the Treaty of Bucharest, but also called for the creation of a Greater Romanian state that would include all ethnic Romanians. This, of course, already put a strain on our relations with Romania, but it has come to the Gendarmerie's attention that a sister movement of the Iron Guard in Transylvania has been rapidly growing since the start of recent unrest in the region. We have the means to suppress the radical movement, but it would be rather costly and may bring even more attention to the troubles."
 romania.57.a: "Suppressing them won't do any good."
 romania.57.b: "We should keep an eye on them."
 romania.58.t: "Terrorism in Transylvania"
 romania.58.d: "Unrest in Transylvania has escalated further as a number of railway lines were bombed last night. The coordination behind the attacks is far too great to be the job of mere amateur anarchists. This is clearly the work of highly organised and equipped terrorists and foreign spies aiming to sabotage our infrastructure. We can only guess that Bucharest's Iron Guard is behind the attacks, but they are apparently denying involvement after the ambassador protested. We will have to increase our military presence in Transylvania as the situation continues to escalate."
 romania.58.a: "Sabotage?!"
 romania.59.t: "Carpathian Garrisons Hit!"
 romania.59.d: "Tensions in Transylvania have reached a new height as garrisons were attacked by bold Romanian terrorists, leading to several casualties on both sides. Some of the terrorist casualties have been identified as Austro-Hungarian citizens, while others remain unidentifiable by our authorities, with suspicions falling on Bucharest. The Romanian government, however, remains uncooperative about the incident, leading to a further rise in tension between our countries. What is certain is that war is coming sooner than we'd like and the Romanians will need to be taught another lesson."
 romania.59.a: "Do they need the Serbia treatment?!"
 romania.60.t: "Strikes Against Air Bases!"
 romania.60.d: "Bucharest-sponsored terrorists have set their sights on a new target: Recently-built air bases. The attack involved the destruction of a hangar before the assault were repelled. While Romania's involvement is obvious, it remains merely an allegation as Bucharest continues to deny involvement to our ambassador. Besides, the value of the bases are clear from a strategic point of view that amateur terrorists would be unlikely to identify on their own. It is fairly clear that the Romanians are getting ready for a fight while we are distracted with other matters."
 romania.60.a: "We will punish them sooner or later."
 romania.74.t: "The Great Union Is Achieved"
 romania.74.d: "The Great Union was the dream that the last remaining Romanian principality, Transylvania, would finally be united with Romania. It is no longer a dream, but a reality achieved with the blood of Romanian patriots. Soldiers are triumphantly marching through Transylvanian cities, cheered on by liberated Romanians, and there is no question among the international community as to who rightfully owns the region. With the king signing the triumphant decree, the dream of Great Union is reality.\n\n\"Transylvania, Banat, Crisana, the Satmar and Maramures are and remain forever united with the kingdom of Romania.\"\n\nThe celebrations, however, hide the anxiety among many notables. After all, reversing the Treaty of Bucharest and liberating Transylvania were the goals keeping Romania's two leaders united. Now, only one man can stay at the top and claim total victory."
 romania.74.a: "But who will get the spoils?"
 romania.34.t: "King Forces through His Reform"
 romania.34.d: "With a strong presence in the Senate, supporters of Carol II are pushing legislation favourable to the royalists' reforms. The Legion, controlling the lower house of Parliament, is currently blocking the proposal. In order to avoid parliamentary deadlock, the Carlists are proposing a compromise, but it would still be a wrench in the Legion's land reform plan. Either we allow the royalists a victory and save our efforts for a more important battle, use Codreanu's powers to outright block their proposal, or maintain an obstructionist approach in Parliament."
 romania.34.a: "Give in to Carlist pressure."
 romania.34.b: "Codreanu blocks the reform."
 romania.34.c: "We shall never compromise!"
 romania.35.t: "Iron Guard Forces through Their Reform"
 romania.35.d: "As Codreanu's Legion controls the lower house of Parliament, they have significant room to manoeuvrer in the legislative process. As such, Codreanu is using this fact as a tool to push his land reform legislation through despite our best efforts to control it. Supporters of the king, however, are numerous in the Senate, giving them the opportunity to use obstructionist means to slowly kill the legislation. On the other hand, we could let the Iron Guard win this round and save our breath for another, more important, battle. Otherwise, the king's extensive powers could be used to outright kill the law there and now, although the Legion is unlikely to take such a forceful response very well."
 romania.35.a: "Give in to the Legion."
 romania.35.b: "The king blocks the reform."
 romania.35.c: "No compromise!"
 romania.72.t: "Ties with Stelescu"
 romania.72.d: "A man claiming to work in the king's name arranged a clandestine meeting with Mihail Stelescu, approaching the young Legionnaire with an offer of support. The king would gladly support his ambitions against Codreanu, Stelescu was told. And so the deal was struck, one that might eventually bring down Codreanu's cult of personality."
 romania.72.a: "Fund him discreetly."
 romania.72.b: "Speak openly for him."
 romania.73.t: "Mihai Stelescu"
 romania.73.d: "The youngest member of the Romanian parliament and a staunch supporter of the Legionary movement, Mihai Stelescu, had quickly risen in the ranks of the movement. He was in many ways the very example of the Legionary his Captain desired: radical, bold and staunchly nationalistic. However, he had gathered his share of enemies during his fast promotion through the ranks of the Guard into becoming one of Codreanu's lieutenants. As such many within the Legion are at least suspicious of the young leader, and some even doubt his loyalty to the Captain. Regardless, the whispers are enough to have gotten the attention of Royalist agents who are more than eager to exploit any cracks in the seemingly-monolithic Iron Guard."
 romania.73.a: "Cursed non-conformists."
 romania.73.b: "Perhaps we should send this man King's regards."
 romania.75.t: "Rise of the White Eagles"
 romania.75.d: "Mihai Stelescu had only risen to prominence some years ago, but the young, shining star of the Legion had quickly gathered his own cult following among the movement. It is not clear whether it is from envy, ambition or idealism, but the young man and his followers have broken off from the main Legionary Movement in a very high-profile event. Stelescu has announced his plans of founding a movement of his own he calls Vulturii Albi, the White Eagles.\n\nStelescu's splinter movement, while still very nationalist and radical, calls for social reforms such as 8-hour work day and decent minimum wages. These ideas have brought many to question the group's true colours, and many prominent Legionnaires are openly accusing Stelescu for being a lapdog for international Jewish-Socialist conspiracy. The White Eagles in turn have criticised the main movement harshly of betraying the working class Romanians.\n\nStelescu's splinter movement is already being branded apostates by many prominent Legionnaires, and the Captain needs to decide soon how to deal with the crisis within the movement."
 romania.75.a: "Apostates deserve only bullets."
 romania.75.b: "Stelescu does make some interesting points."
 romania.75.c: "Now is the chance to strike."
 romania.76.t: "Stelescu found dead"
 romania.76.d: "Mihai Stelescu, an apostate to the Legion, was ambushed and killed by the Decemviri, a Legionnaire death squad. The traitor's body was found mutilated and riddled with over 100 bullets. Many of those who had dared to follow Stelescu's movement were murdered or forced to run.\n\nEven though men of the death squad were promptly imprisoned, it is clear who stands victorious. The Captain awarded the assassins with the White Cross quickly after the event."
 romania.76.a: "We must get to the bottom of this"
 romania.77.t: "Investigation leads to King Carol"
 romania.77.d: "Unsurprisingly, investigation on the Stelescu Affair has led to one man: King Carol himself. The Legion now has solid proof that the king tried to sow dissent within the Legion by encouraging and directly supporting Stelescu's apostasy, giving them ample reason to finally move against Carol once and for all. Regardless, the king's reputation is tarnished after being caught red-handed."
 romania.77.a: "His reputation is ruined!"
 romania.77.b: "We must root out this conspiracy once and for all."
 romania.78.t: "Fate of the King"
 romania.78.d: "After the humiliation from the Stelescu Affair, the Legion and their supporters began actively calling for the abdication of the king. As crowds gathered in front of the Royal Palace to demonstrate, Codreanu ordered Carol's arrest. Neither King Carol nor his guards resisted as the Iron Guard took over the palace. It is now time to decide the king's fate.\n\nOn one hand, the king's weakened position could be advantageous. Keeping him under house arrest after transferring his powers to Codreanu would ensure that he would only have to deal with a feeble, familiar threat that he can easily be rid of should the need arise. Otherwise, Carol should be forced to abdicate, leaving his place to the young Crown Prince Mihai. Queen Helen, the mother of Mihai snubbed by Carol, is particularly supportive of the second option, which could help us form a better relationship with the royal family."
 romania.78.a: "Put him in house arrest."
 romania.78.b: "He has to give up the crown."
 romania.78.tt: "§RThis might give the king a chance to organise a coup d'état.§!"
 romania.79.t: "Mihai I is Crowned King"
 romania.79.d: "After Carol II, the Romanian kingship passes to his son, Mihai. In a ceremony at the Patriarchal Cathedral in Bucharest, the young King was crowned with the Steel Crown and anointed by the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. While the king retains significant powers, Mihai Is a figurehead largely sidelined by the Prime Minister, and there is little reason for this to change anytime soon."
 romania.79.a: "Hopefully he is easier to control."
 romania.80.t: "Military Launches a Coup"
 romania.80.d1: "Despite being under house arrest, King Carol has managed to maintain contact with royalist elements throughout the country. Seeing an opportunity to strike, army officers loyal to the king launched a military coup against the government. Despite having remained neutral throughout the conflict between Carol and Codreanu, it appears that with Codreanu having tipped the balance too far in his favour, the rest of the army now has to decide whether to support the king and their fellow officers or the Prime Minister and the Iron Guard."
 romania.80.d2: "After Codreanu called publicly for his abdication, King Carol made it clear he had no idea of stepping down. Seeing an opportunity to strike, army officers loyal to the king launched a military coup against the government. Despite having remained neutral throughout the conflict between Carol and Codreanu, it appears that with Codreanu having tipped the balance too far in his favour, the rest of the army now has to decide whether to support the king and their fellow officers or the prime minister and the Iron Guard."
 romania.80.a: "The army sides with the putschist officers."
 romania.80.b: "The coup collapses as the army refuses to act."
 romania.80.tt1: "The coup is quick and successful."
 romania.80.tt2: "The coup is successful, even though the situation devolves into bloody fighting in some parts of Bucharest."
 romania.80.tt3: "The coup devolves into bloody fighting until the army units finally break through the Legionary strongholds."
 romania.81.t: "Army Restores Carol II"
 romania.81.d: "As the dust settles and the army secures control of Bucharest, having arrested Codreanu and a number of his lieutenants, the king is escorted out of the Royal Palace. General Paul Teodorescu addresses the gathered crowd and soldiers in front of the palace, declaring Codreanu's government deposed and the restoration of the king's prerogatives. The declaration is followed by a speech by Carol, announcing the beginning of Romania's Renaissance along with a new government to replace Codreanu's. Royalists celebrate their victory while the scattered Iron Guard attempt to resist the coup from the countryside."
 romania.81.a: "Long Live the king!"
 romania.82.t: "Wrath of the King Scorned"
 romania.82.d: "As the scattered, headless Iron Guard struggles to fight back, Royalist forces begin to mop up their remnants. King Carol, feeling his rule secure, ponders about the fate of the high-ranking Legionaries that were arrested during the coup. His Majesty himself is quite convinced that they should be shot as soon as possible, and plenty of members of his Camarilla are in agreement, but others are considering the propaganda value of sparing their lives, keeping them jailed instead. On one hand, purging them once and for all would ensure that they will no longer plot against Him and His wrath will be known throughout Romania. On the other, appealing to the king's kindness will secure a good image for Carol and ensure that moderate politicians will more eagerly serve him once more."
 romania.82.a: "Shoot the Legionaries as traitors."
 romania.82.b: "Let them rot in prison."
 romania.83.t: "The King's Flight"
 romania.83.d1: "With the Royalist coup collapsing, King Carol officially abdicated as King of Romania. During the confusion, the former King and his entourage fled the city to avoid reprisals, likely off to exile in Algeria or Portugal. While the Iron Guard has been unable to catch him, he will finally no longer be a threat to our rule."
 romania.83.d2: "After King Carol's formal abdication he announced his plans of travelling away from Romania, likely off to exile in Algeria or Portugal. Even though he is not legally obliged to flee, Codreanu and his lackeys would not like having the king around and have for all intents and purposes pressured Carol to escape, leaving the country in his son's hands."
 romania.83.a: "Algiers is too good for him."
 romania.83.b: "Algiers is too good for him."
 romania.84.t: "King Mihai Intervenes"
 romania.84.d: "It has become increasingly clear to all Romanians that the situation has grown completely out of control. What was once a stiff, yet subdued, rivalry between two prominent leaders has become a complete mess of open fighting between paramilitaries, countless assassination attempts, and outright terrorism. The young King Mihai has finally decided to intervene directly, a surprise as it has been assumed that he would remain a sideline figurehead. His advisors, however, are divided on what course of action to take. Mihai could either dismiss the government after their abject failure to keep the situation under control, or put his weight behind the Legion and help them retake control."
 romania.84.a: "Dismiss the government!"
 romania.84.b: "The Legion will handle it"
 romania.85.t: "King Mihai Assumes Control"
 romania.85.d: "Unwilling to support the Legion any longer, finding them absolutely abhorrent, the young King has decided to take matters into his own hands and dismissed the government. With the Army behind him, the king declared a state of emergency, with martial law coming into effect immediately. With affairs of state effectively under the king's command, time will tell if the military can sweep away the chaos and restore order."

 romania.87.d: "After an inflammatory speech in the Chamber of Deputies against Codreanu, Stelescu presented numerous allegations against the Captain by submitting facsimiles of Codreanu's civil registry papers. Stelescu's allegations range from accusing the Captain of homosexuality and being directly sponsored by Romania's highest-ranking Freemason.\n\nWhile the Legion insists that Stelescu's allegations are utterly insane, King Carol saw the opportunity given and took it by dismissing Codreanu and his cabinet. Claiming that the Legion was no longer fit to govern or represent the people, the king appointed a new government led by Armand Călinescu.\n\nCodreanu and the Iron Guard are outraged. While we don't truly have a legal reason to, we do have a chance to arrest Codreanu and his thugs while they are vulnerable."
 romania.87.a: "We will merely dismiss them for now."
 romania.87.b: "Arrest them!"
 romania.88.t: "The Captain's Wrath"
 romania.88.d: "Corneliu Codreanu has certainly not taken his dismissal meekly. Angry, fiery speech after fiery speech has driven the Iron Guard into a frenzy. Arresting the former Prime Minister appeared to have done little to stop the demagogue from spreading his venom against the \"treacherous Carol\". Unrest is quickly spreading as legionaries protest their leader's dismissal, demanding his government be reinstated. These demands are, of course, unacceptable. It will be up to the military to handle the situation and ensure the Legion's paramilitaries are suppressed. Otherwise, harsher measures may be needed. Either the Legion should be outright outlawed and completely suppressed, or it may finally be time to cut off the head of the snake and let the Legion fall apart on itself."
 romania.88.a: "Military will handle it."
 romania.88.b: "It is time: assassinate Codreanu!"
 romania.88.c: "Outlaw the Legion and arrest them."
 romania.90.t: "The March on Bucharest"
 romania.90.d: "With the military and police unable to control the unrest, the Legion has gathered a large force outside Bucharest. Hoping to intimidate the government and security forces, the Iron Guard is now marching onto the capital with Corneliu Codreanu at its head. The Legion has gathered thousands of greenshirt-clad members along with a number of supporters. Some of them are armed, though we have no idea how many. The Army has been ordered to stop their march, but there is doubt that they are willing to open fire on the crowd without provocation. It may not be too late to give concessions to appease the Legion so that they will hopefully stand down."
 romania.90.a: "Hold fire unless they shoot first."
 romania.90.b: "Try to appease the Legion with concessions."
 romania.90.c: "Open fire, and don't miss the Captain!"
 romania.90.tt: "§RMany officers fear that an order to shoot at the Legionaries would not be taken well among the Legion-supporting soldiers.§!"
 romania.89.t: "Codreanu Assassinated"
 romania.89.d: "With growing unrest in the countryside, there were rumours a few days ago that the leader of the Iron Guard had gone missing while touring the suburbs of Bucharest to rally support. Today, it was announced that Corneliu Zelea Codreanu was shot while trying to escape custody in Tancabesti near the capital. Their leader's death was confirmed by Codreanu's surviving lieutenants, vowing to avenge him and continue his work.\n\nIt will only be discovered later that he had been dragged by Gendarmes to Jilava Prison and executed there."
 romania.89.a: "Goodbye!"
 romania.91.t: "Violent Clashes in Bucharest"
 romania.91.d: "When the Legionary marchers met the army, there was a brief stand-off until a rifle shot was heard. What followed can only be described as a battle. Armed Greenshirts exchanged fire with soldiers, with both marchers and onlookers stuck in the crossfire. While the Legion's march was crushed and dispersed, it was at the cost of many innocent lives.\n\nThe March on Bucharest will look bad on everyone involved as security forces clear the damage."
 romania.91.a: "These Legionaries are crazy..."
 romania.92.t: "Legionaries Withdraw"
 romania.92.d: "When the Legionary marchers met the army, there was a long, silent stand-off. Soldiers shouldered their rifles, their officers at the ready to give the order, while marchers, waving the Romanian and Legionary colours, stood their ground. Armed Greenshirts were ready to defend the marchers if shots were fired.\n\nNo shots came, however. The army was unwilling to open fire on the crowds, but neither were the Greenshirts. To Codreanu's dismay, as he stood in front of the marchers, his bold march received little attention from the city's residents. The Captain needed either to have intimidated the government or army to turn on the king, or for the March to have instigated a popular demonstration. Abandoned by the city's inhabitants and either unwilling or unable to order his men to attack, the Captain gave the order to withdraw.\n\nA bloodbath was narrowly avoided."
 romania.92.a: "What cowards!"
 romania.93.t: "The Army Stands Down"
 romania.93.d: "When the Legionary marchers met the army, there was a long, silent stand-off. They stood their ground, waving the national and Legionary colours as the soldiers shouldered their rifles. The brief, yet anxious silence was only broken by the officer's order to fire.\n\nBut nothing happened. The soldiers stared at the marchers through their sights, most of them clearly unarmed. In the end, the rifles were put down and the troops crossed over to the other side, cheered.\n\nThe Army had mutinied and sided with the Iron Guard. The king had been abandoned."
 romania.93.a: "Traitors!"
 romania.94.t: "Massacre in Bucharest"
 romania.94.d: "When the Legionary marchers met the army, there was a long, silent stand-off. They stood their ground, waving the national and Legionary colours as the soldiers shouldered their rifles. The brief, yet anxious silence was only broken by the officer's order to fire.\n\nWhat followed was a complete massacre. Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, at the head of the March, was one of the first to fall, followed by numerous Legionaries and their supporters. While armed Greenshirts immediately returned fire, it was largely fruitless and either fell to the bloodbath or fled.\n\nThe king now appears unopposed, but the Massacre will long be remembered."
 romania.94.a: "Good riddance!"
 romania.95.t: "코드레아누의 귀환"
 romania.95.d: "With the Army on his side, Codreanu marched onto the Royal Palace. King Carol's abdication was quickly declared as he fled the country, his appointed government resigning at the sight of the marching Legionaries. Crown Prince Mihai was soon declared to have succeeded his father as King of Romania.\n\nCodreanu stands triumphant, with his rival defeated. However, the ground he stands on is shaky at best as the nation remains highly fractured and unstable."
 romania.95.a: "국왕 폐하 만세!"
 romania.96.t: "The Assassination of King Carol II"
 romania.96.d1: "When their founder was killed, the Legion vowed to avenge him, and they have succeeded. Driving through Bucharest in a luxury automobile, King Carol was ambushed by a Legionary death squad and shot several times, killing him and the other occupants. The assassins, calling themselves the \"Avengers\", quickly fled the scene.\n\nWith the death of the king, the crown is passed to his son, Mihai. The country enters a new stage of chaos and the nation's future remains uncertain."
 romania.96.d2: "After being sidelined from power, the Legion vowed vengeance, and they have succeeded. Driving through Bucharest in a luxury automobile, King Carol was ambushed by a Legionary death squad and shot several times, killing him and the other occupants. The assassins, calling themselves the \"Avengers\", quickly fled the scene.\n\nWith the death of the king, the crown is passed to his son, Mihai. The country enters a new stage of chaos and the nation's future remains uncertain."
 romania.96.a: "Long may he reign."
 romania.96.b: "Perhaps we should find someone more easily malleable?"
 romania.97.t: "Avengers' Coup"
 romania.97.d1: "While the feud between Carol and Codreanu only ended with their deaths, the remnants of the Iron Guard were quick to take advantage of the instability caused by the assassins. Armed Greenshirts have stormed Parliament and numerous strategic points in Bucharest while the Royal Palace is under siege. The Army stationed in and around the city are already on the move, and they will likely decide the fate of the Legion's last ditch attempt to secure the nation."
 romania.97.d2: "After the feud between Carol and Codreanu only ended with King's death, the Captain of the Iron Guard was quick to take advantage of the instability caused by the assassins. Armed Greenshirts have stormed Parliament and numerous strategic points in Bucharest while the Royal Palace is under siege. The Army stationed in and around the city are already on the move, and they will likely decide the fate of the Legion's last ditch attempt to secure the nation."
 romania.97.a: "Back to Bucharest"
 romania.98.t: "The Army Arrives"
 romania.98.d: "While the Army has largely been neutral in the feud between Carol and Codreanu, the two leaders could both count on numerous supporters within. It now has the key to Romania's future: Either help the Greenshirts retake control of the government, or scatter the putschists and side with the young King Mihai."
 romania.98.a: "Help the Legionaries seize control."
 romania.98.b: "We will never support Regicide!"
 romania.99.t: "Codreanu Returns to Power"
 romania.99.d: "As the Legion and Army restored order together, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu reassumed his position as Prime Minister. With Carol dead and Mihai unable to resist, a new question arises: The Fate of the Avengers.\n\nFor many young Legionaries, they are nothing short of heroes, having defended the honour of their Captain by eliminating his greatest threat. On the other hand, the Legion has always been proudly monarchist despite the hostile King; to many of the old guard, there are few crimes greater than regicide. Outside of the movement, moderate politicians and civil servants are terrified that a new precedent has been set, that no target is sacred to the Iron Guard. While Codreanu is uncomfortable about punishing those that only acted in the Legion's best interest and were instrumental in his restoration, the crime of regicide is indeed great and punishing them would alleviate fears among Romanians."
 romania.99.a: "Punish the assassins"
 romania.99.b: "They're the heroes of the nation"
 romania.100.t: "Question of Leadership"
 romania.100.d: "As the Legion and Army restored order together, the question in every Legionary's mind lingered: Who would succeed their great Captain and take his place as Prime Minister?\n\nHoria Sima and Ion Mota stand as the most logical choice to continue Codreanu's work, as they were the lieutenants closest to the Captain in terms of ideals and spirit. Either of them would essentially maintain course. Alternatively, one could look to the \"Outer\" Party instead of the \"Inner\" Party of that Sima and Mota represent. Alexandru Cantacuzino leads that faction, representing an even radical current within the Legion, having openly spoken against the \"foreign\" Hohenzollern dynasty currently holding the Steel Crown of Romania.\n\nConsidering how the power struggle between Codreanu and the king went, a radical course certainly has its appeal. but the Inner Party still holds sway among many Legionaries."
 romania.100.a: "Someone like Codreanu"
 romania.100.b: "We need something more radical!"
 romania.101.t: "Martial Law Declared"
 romania.101.d: "As the Army mopped up the desperate remnants of the Iron Guard, King Mihai stepped in to fill the void, declaring a state of emergency and martial law until order could finally be properly restored. With the Carlist and Legionary forces completely spent from their power struggle, only the Army and the young King Mihai are left standing to pick up the pieces."
 romania.101.a: "The army will fix this insanity!"
 romania.102.t: "King Empowers the Senate"
 romania.102.d: "As he continues to rule by decree in the state of emergency, the young King Mihai has ceded some of his wide powers to the Senate, Parliament's upper house, as one of the first major moves away from the royal dictatorship. This is highly welcomed by the old political elite of the country, as they are finally guaranteed a voice in government once more despite the continued crisis."
 romania.102.a: "It's for the best."
 romania.103.t: "The Dust Settles"
 romania.103.d: "The crisis is finally over; the government has restored order seemingly once and for all. While the nation's future is still clouded in doubt, the way forwards is becoming increasingly clear and a sense of normalcy slowly returns. Time will tell what the future holds for Romania."
 romania.103.a: "Brave New Country..."
 romania.104.t: "Formation of the National Peasants' Party"
 romania.104.d: "The integration of Transylvania has brought significant changes in the political makeup of the nation. The region's dominant party for decades has been the Romanian National Party (PNR), which fought hard against Magyarisation and has been instrumental in the final unification of all Romanian lands. While their hold of Transylvanian politics is near-absolute, they have been detached from pre-unification Romanian politics and have no presence in the rest of the country. To rectify this, they have approached the Peasants' Party (PT) of Ion Mihalache not only to form a coalition against the Legionaries and National Liberals, but to unify the two parties altogether.\n\nAfter long negotiations, the PNR and the PT have agreed to merge into a single party, the National Peasants Party (PNT), creating a formidable political bloc that could prevent the return of either the Legion or the National Liberals. The leadership of the PNT are now deciding on who will lead the unified party.\n\nVirgil Madgearu has been the Peasants' Party's main ideologue for most of its existence and has been an outspoken critic of both National Liberal and Legionary political monopolies. Representing the left-wing, his platform is centred around the \"Community of Producers\", supporting cooperative farming and the dominance of labour over capital.\n\nIuliu Maniu was one of the leaders of the PNR and is seen as leading the centre of the new party with a platform focusing on class collaboration and corporatism.\n\nAlexandru Vaida-Voevod was the other big name of the PNR and maintains a more conservative approach with the party's right-wing. His platform is economically-driven, focusing on regional development and national stability.\n\nThe three leaders, at their core, support a more decentralised approach compared to the centralism of the National Liberals and the Legion, mixed economic policies, and parliamentary democracy."
 romania.104.a: "Virgil Madgearu leads the new party."
 romania.104.b: "Iuliu Maniu is elected chairman."
 romania.104.c: "알렉산드루 바이다-보에보드가 이끌 것이다."
 romania.105.t: "[GetYear] General Election"
 romania.105.d: "With the dust settled, King Mihai's military government have made true to their promises and organised the country's first free election in some years. While many fear the return of the Legion into power, the National Liberal Party (PNL) has enthusiastically campaigned as Romania's only hope to secure democracy once more. Constantin Angelescu is currently leading the party, focusing on a programme of economic development and self-reliance, and securing the democratisation of the country.\n\nOn the far-right, the Legion of Archangel Michael, commonly known as the Iron Guard, gather their strength one more time despite their recent troubles. Should they succeed, they would gain a popular mandate that may just put life back into their movement. Failure, however, will likely mean the collapse of the movement altogether.\n\n[ROM_PNT_electoral_status]"

 romania.105.b: "The Legion secures Parliament once more!"
 romania.105.c: "The PNT win the election!"
 romania.106.t: "[GetYear] General Election"
 romania.106.d: "With democracy secured in Romania, the people go to the polls once more to elect members of both Chamber of Deputies and Senate. The National Liberal Party (PNL) remains on the forefront of Romanian democracy as the Iron Guard has fallen into irrelevance. Their programme has changed little since the previous election, exalting the cementing of democratic traditions and the country's progress in economic development.\n\n[ROM_PNT_electoral_status]"
 romania.106.a: "The PNL are elected."
 romania.106.b: "The PNT win the election."
 romania.107.t: "Gheorghe Brătianu and Factionalism"
 romania.107.d: "Ever since the National Liberal Party failed to keep the Legion from gaining power in the country, the party has been struggling with factionalism. While the PNL has largely remained united while Legionnaires roamed the streets, the question of the Brătianu family is threatening to bring dissidence within the party onto the fore.\n\nThe two cousins, Dinu and Gheorghe Brătianu, have been active in the PNL's reconstruction and electoral victory. However, in order to avoid controversy, as the PNL has long been accused of being monopolised by the Brătianu family, they have been largely relegated to minor positions despite their unwavering support of the party. While Dinu is largely remaining quiet over the issue, Gheorghe has become increasingly agitated over it and has been rallying other dissidents within the party behind him. The party leadership has been pressured into making a formal decision on the matter: Either give the Brătianu scions a position worthy of their contributions to the party, or continue to keep them in lower positions."
 romania.107.a: "For the PNL's image, they must keep a low profile."
 romania.107.b: "For party unity, give them what they want."
 romania.108.t: "Gheorghe Brătianu Splits"
 romania.108.d: "Gheorghe Brătianu, tired of being kept away from the party leadership, has officially left the PNL with a small number of dissidents to form his own party. Thankfully, damage has been fairly limited and the press has been very critical of Brătianu's actions, some even praising our commitment to the party's new image. In the end, the PNL will likely recover from the split relatively quickly."
 romania.108.a: "They'll be back soon enough."
 romania.109.t: "Criticism in the Chamber of Deputies"
 romania.109.d: "A Peasant deputy from Moldavia gave a stirring speech in Parliament against the recent appointments of Dinu and Gheorghe Brătianu. He was quick to remind other deputies of the PNL's history with the Brătianu family, calling the party a shameless oligarchy monopolised by the \"Brătianu dynasty\". All in all, this has hurt our image as a new, reformed National Liberal Party."
 romania.109.a: "This will pass, as it always has."
 romania.110.t: "Romania Asks to Rejoin the Entente"
 romania.110.d: "When Austria-Hungary seemed to be on the brink of defeat, Romania declared war on them in 1916, joining our righteous cause against the Central Powers. However, the Romanians were pushed back and defeated, resulting in the humiliating Treaty of Bucharest.\n\nIt has been around twenty years, and the Romanians have been able to overthrow their Germanic oppressors and liberate their brethren across the Carpathians. Now that they have successfully reclaimed their right as a nation, they are officially asking to rejoin the Entente and support us in our righteous endeavour."

 romania.112.t: "The Entente Has Denied Us!"
 romania.112.d: "The Entente has refused our offer to renew our military alliance with them. We can only guess their motives for their betrayal, but it appears our nation will have to look elsewhere, or inward, for support."

 romania.113.t: "Romania Abandons our Faction"
 romania.113.d: "Having achieved their irredentist goals, Romania has decided to terminate their military alliance with them. While annoying, this was largely expected, and Romania may have become a useless burden in the future otherwise."

Despite the flagrant undemocratic programmes of the government, the Romanian Parliament has remained open, if only as a tool to maintain legitimacy and rubber-stamp policies.\n\nAs such, in this era of political violence and intimidation, general elections are coming up and the major paramilitaries are already planning to intimidate the opposition into submission or silence.

During the Weltkrieg, he proved highly competent, securing several victories during the defence of Romania from the invading Central Powers. Ambitious and bitter at the Treaty of Bucharest, he was one of the principal voices lionising the Romanian Army's conduct during the war and eagerly claiming that the country's politicians had stabbed them in the back by signing the treaty. While the main signatory of the treaty, Alexandru Marghiloman, would become quickly ostracised by the Nation, Averescu would be showered with praise, becoming Marshal of Romania in 1927. Regardless, Averescu was never able to capitalise on the unstable political situation in the country and would largely remain in the sidelines while Codreanu's Legion would rise to power, which he quietly supported during his own feud with the king.\n\nA state funeral with full military honours will be organised for him as the Romanian nation mourns one of its heroes that brightly shone during its darkest times."

A career officer, his outstanding service life began as a cadet in 1868, rising through the ranks as a skilled staff officer (something extremely valuable at the time) before further studying at the prestigious military academy at Saint-Cyr. He would become highly-distinguished during the Second Balkan War as a Brigadier General and he would be quickly promoted afterwards. By the time Romania declared war on the Central Powers, Prezan commanded the First Army, securing Romania's few offensive victories of the war. This success saw him further promoted to Chief of Staff after the fall of Bucharest, where he would organise Romania's successful defence of Moldavia from General Mackensen's combined Central Powers force. With the signing of the Treaty of Bucharest, Prezan opted to retire, remaining aloof from the unstable post-war situation. Nevertheless, his superb abilities were recognised despite the defeat and he would be honoured with a marshal's baton in 1930 while his advice was highly-sought, remaining a quiet privy councillor to the king.\n\nThe venerable marshal will receive a proper state funeral with full military honours expected of Romania's heroes. Marshal Prezan's protégé and chief of staff in the Weltkrieg, Ion Antonescu, eulogised him as a \"symbol of hard work, patriotism, unwavering faith, and sacrifice\"."

 romania.136.t: "루마니아의 부코비나 요구"
 romania.136.d: "Today a message has been delivered to us by way of the Romanian embassy, with the dignitaries looking very serious as they delivered it. Upon further examination, it was an ultimatum: Romania demands the restitution of the lands of Bucovina, which it claims is a vital part of its own history that was unlawfully ceded centuries ago, and now the time has come to reintegrate it within the fold; and should we refuse, Romania is ready to back this demand up by force of arms. A possible war hangs in the balance, over a piece of land that may not even be that valuable to us in the first place. How should we respond?"

 romania.138.t: "[From.GetName] refuses to submit"
 romania.138.d: "[From.GetNameDef] has stubbornly refused to cede Bucovina! What drove them to do this is unknown, but what is certain is that this will lead to war. Our troops stand ready to begin the reclamation of the voivodal forests, and bring another core piece of our heritage home."

 romania.138.b: "They saw right through our bluff."
 romania.139.t: "Romania demands West Banat"
 romania.139.d: "Today, the Romanian embassy within our territory has sent a message to us, and its dignitaries looked very solemn as they carried out their duty. It was a message most dire about the status of the Western Banat: specifically, Romania argues that the Treaty of Bucharest in 1916 grants it a legitimate claim on the area, and as the Banat is one entity, it should belong to the Romanian nation. More disconcertingly, they mention this claim is legitimate enough to be backed by force of arms if necessary. As concerning as this message is, it is a small and relatively non-important piece of land: how shall we respond?"
 romania.139.a: "Tell them where the border is!"
 romania.139.b: "Hand it over, it's not worth fighting a war over this."
 romania.140.t: "[From.GetName] submits!"

 romania.141.t: "[From.GetName] stands firm"
 romania.141.d: "[From.GetName] shocked us by not only refusing to cede the Western Banat, but also sending a very sharp-worded letter informing us of just where our borders are and of the exact value of our claim! While the news are unfortunate, they knew what they were getting into, and our troops stand ready, waiting for the order to strike."

 romania.142.t: "Racovski Retires from PSR Leadership"
 romania.142.d: "Cristian Racovski, until now one of the leaders of the Romanian Syndicalist Party, announced his retirement at the party's Central Committee. His position on the committee and leader of the informal Vanguardist faction has been assumed by his protégé Gheorghe Gheorghiu.\n\nBorn in Bulgaria, he settled in Romania in 1904 after inheriting his father's estate. Already a committed revolutionary, he wrote for the socialist newspaper Romania Muncitoare and would be expelled from the country in 1907 for rebellious agitation, and again in 1911 after secretely returning to Bucharest. In exile, he remained dedicated to the socialist cause in Romania before becoming involved in the Russian Civil War as a diplomat for the Bolsheviks. When they were defeated, Racovski was one of many former Reds to find themselves in revolutionary Paris and would continue to represent the Romanian socialist movement abroad as a member of the Third Internationale.\n\nAfter decades of service, the old revolutionary has deemed it time to cede his place to the younger generation. Gheorghe Gheorghiu has taken his place as leader of the PSR's informal left-wing."

 romania.142.b: "These socialists are irrelevant."
 romania.143.t: "Transylvanian militia stand down"
 romania.143.d: "The uprising we had sponsored raised multiple ad-hoc units whose part in the initial stage of the offensive was crucial for our victory. Now that their homes have been liberated, these units have been disbanded, though part of the brave men has shown their willingness to join the army proper. Nonetheless names of these true patriots will be forever remembered on the both sides of the Carpathians."
 romania.143.a: "The nation is in their debt."
 romania.144.t: "A Deal with Bucharest?"
 romania.144.d: "As our government reasserted our rightful claims over the lands lost in 1918, the Romanians has been understandably worried. Nevertheless, the Romanian government has approached us with a proposal: In exchange for abandoning our claims over Bessarabia, Romania is willing to join our alliance and support our noble crusade against the Germanic hegemon.\n\nOn one hand, we would officially abandon lands that were once part of Mother Russia. On the other, it would ensure that the Romanians do not align with the Germans and ensure we do not have to deal with another front."
 romania.144.a: "We accept."
 romania.144.b: "No, Bessarabia is rightfully Russian!"
 romania.145.t: "Russia Accepts"
 romania.145.d: "The Russians have decided to abandon their claims on Bessarabia. In exchange, we will be supporting them in their mission to topple the Germanic hegemon."

 romania.146.t: "Russia Refuses"
 romania.146.d: "The Russians have refused to abandon their claims on Bessarabia. We will have to look elsewhere for help should the perfidious Russian bear decides to press that unreasonable claim."
 romania.146.a: "They can't be serious..."
 romania.147.t: "Romania Seeks Help"
 romania.147.d: "With [RUS.GetNameDef] reasserting their claims to our sphere of influence, the Romanian government has also been targetted through the Russian claims on Bessarabia. With talks between the two nations falling through, Bucharest has instead approached us. Seeing that Russia is a common threat, the Romanian government has offered a defensive treaty that would essentially tie them to the Reichspakt.\n\nResponse has been fairly mixed. Few have forgotten Romania's nationalisation of the Ploiesti oil fields to our detriment and their unilateral repudiation of the Treaty of Bucharest. In response, it's been suggested that we should demand concessions in return, but the Romanians will walk-out in response. In the end, the treaty would ensure that the Romanian oil fields will not fall to the Russians and give us a significant regional ally on the Dniester."
 romania.147.a: "Hopefully they will be more useful than the Austrians."
 romania.147.b: "We can't trust them."
 romania.148.t: "Germany Accepts"
 romania.148.d: "Germany has agreed to sign a defensive treaty with us. We are now tied with the Reichspakt against the Russian and Syndicalist threats."
 romania.148.a: "We can move on from 1918 now."
 romania.149.t: "Germany Refuses"
 romania.149.d: "Unsurprisingly, the Germanic hegemon has refused our offer. Of course, it was a stretch that they would accept, but it was already hard for us to offer a compromise in the first place. It appears that both Russian and German Empires are enemies of Romania."
 romania.149.a: "As expected."

 romania.150.d: "The fragile alliance between King Carol II of Romania and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu's Legionary Movement was seemingly fated to not last long. Codreanu having been taken out in order to decapitate his movement, but his scorned followers regrouped quickly and tried an avenging gamble to assasinate the King, which has succeeded.\n\nIn the wake of the bloodbath in the capital, the Prince [ROM.GetLeader] has been crowned as King, and it remains to be seen how will he manage to bring peace to his country."

 romania.151.d: "The fragile alliance between King Carol II of Romania and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu's Legionary Movement was seemingly fated to not last long, and news from Bucharest have confirmed that, indeed, it finally collapsed.\n\nA failed attempt by the ambitious monarch to take advantage of a schism in the burgeoning Legionary Movement has backfired hard, and [ROM.GetLeader] is crowned as the king for new Legionary Romania."
 romania.151.a: "For King, Cross and People!"
 romania.152.t: "Carol of Romania Expels Iron Guard"
 romania.152.d: "The fragile alliance between King Carol II of Romania and Codreanu's Legionary Movement was seemingly fated to not last long, and news from Bucharest have confirmed that it finally collapsed.\n\nA clash within the seemingly-powerful Legionary Movement was masterfully exploited by King Carol II to oust their cabinet and break their dominance of government, with the King announcing that the time has come for such divisive factionalism to end in his country, and taking full control in the process."

 romania.153.t: "Parliamentary Romania Restored by Military"
 romania.153.d: "After the blood-soaked end of the power struggle between King Carol II and the Legionary Movement, many expected the young King to yield to the unwavering Greenshirts and let them continue their rule, but today the young Monarch has utterly destroyed these theories by announcing the dismissal of the Legionaries from Government.\n\nThe King also assured the people that constitutional reform will ensue, and that the ageing Constitution will, at long last, be updated."
 romania.153.a: "Democracy returns to Romania"
 romania.154.t: "A New Palace for a New Capital"
 romania.154.d: "One of the few things that King Carol and the Legionary movement agree upon is the importance of public works, albeit the two have a notable difference in that the Legionaries favour smaller-scale works like roads and dykes as a primary goal while Carol favours more massive undertakings as his first priority. After some notable wrangling in the legislature involving heated debates between the Cabinet and the Monarch, be it on regular meetings or during presided sessions of Parliament, the King has managed to obtain approval for some massive investments in Bucharest, especially regarding the continuation of the New Royal Palace project, in exchange for refurbishing rural roads, bridges and dykes throughout Oltenia and Muntenia.\n\nNot only will these investments provide valuable jobs to the economy especially in times like these, but they will also leave behind an immortalised legacy, be it through the memory of rural infrastructural repair or through the magnificence of the new Royal Palace. With the remaining barriers out of the way, construction will begin in earnest, starting with the clearing of the ruins of the Old Royal Palace, also known as the Golescu Mansion, from their spot on Calea Victoriei."
 romania.154.a: "Bucharest shall be a city worthy of its ruler!"
 romania.155.t: "Construction Finishes on the New Royal Palace"
 romania.155.d: "Today in 1937, the New Royal Palace was inaugurated in the presence of His Majesty the King Carol II, His Highness the Crown Prince Mihai, His Excellency the President of the Council of Ministers Corneliu Codreanu and a dazzling array of statesmen, dignitaries and more. Designed by architect Nicolae Nenciulescu with heavy involvement from the King and the Queen Mother Maria, the new Palace stands as a monumental reminder of the splendour of King Carol's reign, with his Royal cypher prominently decorating many elements of the construction.\n\nBucharest will continue experiencing various beatifications and repairs as a result of the new wave of constructions ushered by the palace's construction, and the royals themselves have appeared pleased with how the edifice has turned out. The new structure will be the official residence of the Romanian monarchy, although the Royal family themselves have also had a smaller villa built on the premises, known as the \"New House\", in order to have some privacy every once in a while."
 romania.155.a: "A palace worthy of a true King!"
 romania.156.t: "The Ecclesiastical Union"
 romania.156.d: "With the political unification of the Romanians past the Carpathians with their brothers, it made little sense to continue the separation between the Metropolises of Transylvania and the ones of Moldova and Ungrovlachia; as such, the two have officially established ties to one another, the Transylvanian church, led by Metropolitan Nicolae Balan, has chosen to join the Holy Synod of the Metropolis of Ungrovlachia, meaning that, while mantaining its independence, the ecclesiastical authorities in Transylvania shall place themselves fully under the Romanian umbrella.\n\nMetropolitan-Primate Vartolomeu Stanescu of Ungrovlachia, Archbishop of Bucharest has welcomed the move, and rumours even have it that the enlarged Romanian church will seek to elevate its status to a full-fledged patriarchy as a result of its vastly-increased reach, a move that will certainly be welcomed by the Romanian state. Bishop of Caransebes has also expressed support for the union, albeit lamenting that his failing health will prevent him from serving the Romanian church in a better capacity."
 romania.156.a: "Our flock grows bigger."
 romania.157.t: "A New Patriarchate"
 romania.157.d: "Today on [GetDateText], the Holy Synod has voted to elevate the status of the Romanian church to a full-fledged Patriarchate, with the government of Romania welcoming this move, due to its further cementation of Romania's hold over its new lands and the spiritual unity of its religious subjects being very beneficial. Orthodox clerics on both sides of the Carpathians have expressed their appreciation towards this increase of status, bringing up the status of Bulgaria and that of Serbia as an example for why Romania should finally have its own patriarchy. Supportive voices from other denominations have also risen, most proeminently that of Greek Catholic Bishop of Cluj-Gherla Iuliu Hossu.\n\nNow the last remaining issue is to choose the first Patriarch of a United Romania, and three candidates have reached a particular level of notability. The first is incumbent Metropolitan-Primate of Ungrovlahia Vartolomeu Stanescu, although he hasn't expressed much of a preference in the matter, saying that it is up to God whether he is chosen or not, and that if he isn't he would retreat to a monastery to live out his last days in peace, his metropolitanate having been very taxing. Another candidate is Nicodim Munteanu, Metropolitan of Moldova, whose firm stance on syndicalism has earned him many sympathies in the country. Finally, as a show of unity, we could elect the incumbent Metropolitan of Transylvania, Nicolae Balan, who has shown himself to be a very careful teacher to his flock and grew to be very respected, in addition to being very interested in the education of Transylvanian Romanians and national unity. Who shall guide the Church in these next years?"
 romania.157.a: "Elect Metropolitan-Primate Vartolomeu, for continuity and steady leadership."
 romania.157.b: "Elect Metropolitan Nicodim, he shall be a rock for the new Church!"
 romania.157.c: "Elect Metropolitan Nicolae, in the name of unity and dignity."
 romania.158.t: "Records and Tunes"
 romania.158.d: "This year marks a momentous occasion, as the native recording company Electrecord has finally acquired enough means to produce records through its own means, heralding a new age in the Romanian recording industry.\n\nFounded in 1932 by the Jewish entrepreneur Nathan Mischonzniki, the young company initially focused itself on importing and multiplying foreign records, as well as distributing native recordings made overseas. Protected by King Carol II from the worst of his government's excesses due to seeing its value, the company grew in spite of the hostile circumstances, up to the point it reached this important milestone. Already various Romanian artists are beginning to make deals with the burgeoning company, ensuring a stable growth in production and popularity for the burgeoning Electrecord."
 romania.158.a: "Play it again, Sam."
 romania.159.t: "For My Legionaries"
 romania.159.d: "In spite of having to tackle the additional responsibilities of governance in addition to having to lead the Legionary Movement, the \"Captain\", Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, has found enough time in his schedule to work on a new book; a volume that is part autobiography, part ideological manifesto.\n\nTitled For My Legionaries, the book tells the story of its founder's life from a fatidic oath in a forest around Husi to his first forays into Parliament and assumption of the Prime Ministerial office, heavily interspersed with its author's musings on a host of topics from the role of the monarchy to that of the nation as a whole. Written in a relatively curt, diary-like style spiced with various speeches, article quotations, letters and Bible passages, it proved to be very popular once published, with its first edition selling out in a few weeks (the 2500 free examples distributed to members who could not afford it notwithstanding), and demand for a new one gradually going up.\n\nThe Prime Minister himself was surprised by the speed with which his volume flew off the shelves, and was said to have entered talks to have new editions published, with more ambitious voices claiming it will also be translated into foreign languages soon enough."
 romania.159.a: "A momentous occasion!"
 romania.159.b: "Let him have his fun, his time will come one day."
 romania.160.t: "The First Volume of the Encyclopaedia of Romania"
 romania.160.d: "The eminent professor and sociologist Dimitrie Gusti has added yet another success to his career recently with the publication of the first volume of his newest project, The Encyclopaedia of Romania.\n\nCoordinated by him and contributed to by various high-ranking Romanian intellectuals like Nicolae Iorga and Constantin Radulescu-Motru, under the patronage of [ROM.GetLeader], the Encyclopaedia is planned to encompass a great host of subjects related to Romania, and will be organised in three sections and six volumes. The first section containing the first two volumes, of which the first one, \"The State\" concerns itself with the State and encompasses the country's history, geography, political system and more, and the planned second one will focus on the administrative divisions. The second section will encompass Volumes 3 and 4, concerning themselves with the national economy and transports, circulation and commerce respectively, whereas the third section encompassing volumes 5 and 6 will focus itself on national culture and cultural institutions and personalities of note respectively.\n\nAn project long in the making, aided along by collaborators across the Carpathians and fortuitously finished after the Unification, it stands as a testament to the dedication of Professor Giusti to his craft and to his country. The next five volumes are slated for publication in the following years, further solidifying the legacy of him and his many collaborators to the scientific heritage of Romania."
 romania.160.a: "An ambitious, yet commendable initiative!"
 romania.161.t: "Otilia's Enigma"
 romania.161.d: "University lecturer and rising star in the world of literary criticism George Călinescu has recently chosen to experiment with a more conventional literary form; the novel, and recently his efforts have come to fruition through the publication of his work, Enigma Otiliei.\n\nDescribed as a Balzacian novel, it is set in antebellum Romania, telling the tale of young medicine student Felix Sima, who moves in with his rich yet miserly uncle Costache Giurgiuveanu. There he meets Otilia Mărculescu, the man's stepdaughter, alongside his uncle's sister's family, the Tulea's- and family friend Leonida Pascalopol. Felix gradually falls in love with Otilia, who unfortunately doesn't fully return his feelings, showing some preference for Pascalopol instead. All the while, in spite of loving his stepdaughter in his own way, Giurgiuveanu is reticent to fully adopt her and make her a main beneficiary of his inheritance, resulting in a conflict where he has to deal with the Tulea family and their quest to seize control of his fortune, be it via inheritance or other means. After a surprising trip to Paris on Otilia's behalf, an affair with a courtesan on Felix's end, and the Tulea schemes to seize Costache's fortune, the two youths meet each other again, but in spite of tension do not take the final leap. Eventually, a Tulea kinsman manages to steal Giurgiuveanu's wealth, who dies from a shock-induced heart attack, and Otilia ends up marrying Pascalopol and leaving for Paris again. After the war, Felix meets Pascalopol again, who reveals that he and Otilia got divorced, the latter remarrying and moving to Buenos Aires, becoming unrecognisable to her former admirer.\n\nPortraying a modernist outlook on antebellum Bucharest bourgeoisie, coupled with themes of paternity, coming of age, and unrequited love it is selling surprisingly well. Reviews are positive, and critics foresee a brilliant career for Mr. Călinescu."
 romania.161.a: "Nobody lives here."
 romania.162.t: "The Coronation of King Carol II"
 romania.162.d: "Celebrations sweep the Nation as the announced second Coronation of King Carol II has finally arrived, and the entire country drapes itself in the tricolour to mark the event.\n\nArriving early in the morning, the royal couple was greeted with the traditional bread and salt by the town's mayor, after which the royal suite headed towards the new Cathedral of the Coronation, entering the Citadel via the Sixth Gate. After a liturgy officiated within by clerics from all parts of the Kingdom and a Te Deum by the newly-enthroned Patriarch of Romania, the royal suite and King went outside, where an ornate baldachin lay in wait before the belltower.\n\nAfter the benediction of the royal mace and crown, the King placed the Steel Crown upon his own head, following the Byzantine and Napoleonic models, proceeding to crown Queen Elena afterwards. The King proceeded to address the nation, and soon afterwards a Royal banquet was held, the festivities dragging out through the day until around sunset."
 romania.162.a: "Long Live King Carol II, King of All Romanians!"
 romania.163.t: "See, the Conquering Hero Comes"
 romania.163.d: "It is a festive day in the ancient town of Alba Iulia, with the Transylvanian town draped in blue, gold and red, for His Majesty Carol II, the King of Romania, accompanied by a host of statesmen and soldiers, is holding a grand celebration to mark the Union of Transylvania with Romania.\n\nAccompanied by his suite, the King has entered the town's citadel through the Sixth Gate, and continued through the Fifth and Fourth towards the so-named Union Hall, where he held a momentous speech to mark the occasion. Within the speech, he expressed his amazement of being witness to such a momentous occasion, long-dreamed by his country and its people, thanked the Transylvanians for accepting him as their monarch, and announced that this visit shall not be his last, for a fatuous coronation ceremony shall be held within the town, to mark the completion of the Unification of the Romanian lands.\n\nAlready plans have been drawn for a magnificent cathedral to be built and organisers are scrambling to make the event as great as possible, a fitting culmination for the national edification of the Romanian nation."
 romania.163.a: "Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!"
 romania.164.t: "Fading Revanchism"
 romania.164.d: "With the finalisation of the national unification process, the once-prevalent revanchistic zeal that used to be powerful enough to propel the relatively little-known Iron Guard into power at the start of the 1930s has begun to weaken.\n\nAided along by the sustained losses of the past World War and the Austrian conflict and the perceived righting of the unjust treaty, revanchism has begun a steady decline within Romania, as priorities begin to shift from obtaining claimed territory to consolidating what is already owned. Though the flame of nationalism is still ablaze, it appears that the desire for expansionism has been finally sated. Even nationalistic parties have begun to shift their rhetoric appropriately, although some say that this will lead to a decline in Iron Guard popularity as one of its main wellsprings of support has dried up."
 romania.164.a: "We have seen enough - we're satisfied."
 romania.165.t: "Romania Declares the Treaty of Bucharest Null and Void"
 romania.165.d: "The end of the First Weltkrieg has seen a devastating treaty imposed onto Romania, the infamous Treaty of Bucharest which so many political forces in Romania have struggled against. Until now.\n\nAfter the end of the war, many PNL cabinets have tried to gradually weaken the Treaty with the then-present situation of the country in mind, albeit it was not seen as enough by the angered and weary populace, contributing to the rise of revanchistic populist movements in the period and culminating in the Iron Guard's rise to power, which continued this process. With the German economic crisis, even more of the treaty's provisions started to be skirted or openly ignored, and now, with the outbreak of the Second Weltkrieg, the powers that be have seen it fit to finally proclaim the end of the humiliating treaty. Taking advantage of the Germans' distraction, the President of the Council of Ministers [GetSecondInCommand] have formally declared that the Treaty is null and void, and that should the Germans want to review their relationship with Romania, they will have to negotiate with the Romanians on equal terms.\n\nThe once-sidelined and now dismissed German ministerial officials are leaving the country in droves as Romania is establishing proper control over its river ports and the Mouths of the Danube, having also seized control of the Danube Commission's activities on its territory."
 romania.165.a: "Shackled no more!"
 romania.166.t: "The Legionaries Crumble"
 romania.166.d: "The Legionary Movement had risen from a small splinter group to become a very powerful force in Romanian politics... yet it seems they may be heading towards their predecessor's fate.\n\nThe once-small group grew rapidly in size and influence, especially after getting co-opted into power and after the unification with Transylvania, however with size it also gained a lot of problems. Codreanu's highly personalistic, circulary-focused and one-on-one contact-oriented leadership style has begun to falter, in spite of attempts to temper the growing zeal of his recruits. Tightening ranks, enforcing waits and probation periods between joining the Party and the Legion proper, a lot was attempted to try and temper the ballooning Iron Guard's growth and effervescence.\n\nYet, it was not enough. Many radicals across the various factions of the movement have begun to grow discontented with the \"parliamentarisation\" of the movement, and began to yearn for the earlier days of the Guard, when it was more militant and combative. The decline of revanchism also began to hit the Legionaries' odds by reducing the wellsprings they could tap into for support. Recent setbacks have weakened movement's unity even further and the factions that used to work together have begun to openly rally against each other. These factors, and more, have led to its own control over its own members beginning to fray at the edges, and now, it is beginning to snap.\n\nMany have begun to leave, others began to form splinter groups, and in general the once-mighty behemoth of the Iron Guard has begun to collapse under its own weight. While still a force to be reckoned with, at least in the near future, it will not reach the same prominence it once had, and it is theorised it will begin falling into the same downward spiral its predecessor, the LANC, once fell in."

 romania.168.t: "The End of Weitzer and of MARTA"
 romania.168.d: "With the Romanian seizure of Transylvania, many companies located within the area's borders had to reprofile themselves to adapt to the new reality, and the MARTA factory of Arad is no exception. Created in 1909 as a subsidiary of Austro-Daimler and initially producing licensed Westinghouse cars, the factory grew to become a developing force in the area, alongside Johann Weitzer's locomotive and wagon company. In spite of difficulties caused by the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, during which the MARTA factory had to cease production, the two continued onwards.\n\nHowever, with the Romanian acquisition of Transylvania, the future of the two became uncertain. Cut off from their old markets and having to bear with the land's new rulers, the two factories decided to move along with the times. Maintaining the Weitzer society' focus on rolling stock while MARTA began to take a more junior role, the two entities merged, in order to more efficiently fulfil their niche within the new order, taking on a new identity."

 romania.171.d: "The day much-awaited by [GetSecondInCommand]'s cabinet has finally arrived, as Duce Italo Balbo of Italy has finally arrived in the capital. Greeted at the Banease airport by a dazzling array of orderly and disciplined soldiers alongside stern green shirt-clad Legionaries, Duce Balbo proceeded to meet his Romanian counterparts, being welcomed with the traditional bread and salt.\n\nThen the visit began in earnest. After a private discussion at the Prime Minister's residence between Balbo and Codreanu, the Duce and his delegation were given a tour of the Capital, taken to various sites showcasing the city's development; from the Belle Epoque area around Lipscani Street to the modern Magheru Boulevard, culminating in the arrival on Calea Victoriei and the new Royal Palace, where they were greeted by the King, and a joint declaration of friendship was signed. The next day, after other visits to various areas of the Capital ranging from the Inn of Manuc to the so-called \"Green House\", the Legionaries' Bucharest headquarters, Duce Balbo and the Italian delegation were taken to a Legionary worksite where he was shown the Greenshirts' work discipline. Later that day a state dinner was held at the Royal Palace.\n\nOn the third and final day, the delegation was taken to a concert showcasing traditional and modern Romanian and Italian music, before a second discussion with the Prime Minister, the Internal Affairs and Foreign Affairs ministers and the King. After a pause to let the guests rest before the journey back to Italy, the Italian delegation was seen off at the Baneasa airport once more. Reportedly, Duce Balbo was pleasantly impressed by the reception given to him by his Romanian counterparts."

 romania.172.t: "Nicolae Radescu Returns"
 romania.172.d: "Shortly after King Mihai's coup, old general Nicolae Radescu returned to active service. Radescu is a decorated cavalry veteran of both the Second Balkan War and the Weltkrieg, and his return to active service is seen as a symbolic act to honour the young king. He was a close adjutant of late King Ferdinand and a military attaché in London, but Carol II's 'commercialisation of military life' had led to his resignation from active service. He was monitored closely by the Royal Camarilla, as Radescu spoke openly against Carol II on many occasions and was known to participate in far-right rallies. Now that the Carol II he resented has been ousted from power, he has offered his services to his fatherland once more."
 romania.172.a: "Good to have him back."
 romania.173.t: "Constantin Tobescu returns from exile"
 romania.173.d: "General Constantin Tobescu fled the country after Codreanu's ascension, as he could not accept serving under the Iron Guard he opposed, even if his beliefs weren't completely opposed to them. Tobescu is a veteran of the Weltkrieg, but he is best known from his long career in Romanian Gendarmerie, commanding the Gendarmerie Inspectorate of Bucharest in the early 1930s. Now that the Legionaries have been ousted from the power, Tobescu has once again offered his services to his fatherland."

 romania.174.d: "The Ploesti fields are among the richest oil deposits of Europe. After the Weltkrieg control over them was given to major German and Austrian corporations, but they lost the control over the country in the aftermath of the Black Monday. Now Romania is on her knees once more, and we can re-establish our control over their precious oil wells and refineries."

 romania.175.d: "In order to better tie our country together and to further raise the renown of the age we live in, the King has formally announced the start of the Transalpina project; a spectacular mountain road that will connect the Old Kingdom and Transylvania even further.\n\nIt will cross the Southern Carpathians through the Parang group, and will span from Novaci, to the northeast of Targu Jiu, centre of Gorj County, all the way to Sebes, within Alba County. With a spectacular route and the opening of mountain tourism possibilities in the area, to say nothing of the benefits of an extra route, excitement is suitably high."

 romania.177.t: "The Resita Reorganisation"
 romania.177.d: "A long-established centre of ironworking and heavy industry, Resita has long prospered off the back of its heavy industry, industry that has as last fallen into our hands.\n\nWhile the facilities are held by the Austrian StEG concern, the obvious problem of the Austrian railway enterprise owning the works has arisen, and will be solved by gradually splitting off its assets within Romania; the railways proper going to the Romanian Railways state company and the Resita works going to a new industrial concern, to be named Uzinele si Domeniile Resita (Resita Domains and Works), or UDR for short.\n\nKnown iron importer and businessman Max Auschnitt has managed to position himself as administrator of the vast works while the transition is being carried out, and rumour has it he will seek to become the main manager of it.\n\nWhile the King may personally be fine with such a move considering Auschnitt's ties with the royal family, his business associate-turned-rival Nicolae Malaxa is protesting this takeover. He has put forward one of his men: engineer Virgil Ionescu, known donor to the \"Friends of the Legion\" association, regional commander and a seasoned Malaxa employee. Whom shall lead the new works forward, for the choice rests in His Majesty's hands..."

The King has shown himself to be receptive to the idea as well, and if we enact it now, we may capture a significant portion of this new demographic. Considering the ever-expanding list of countries that have taken the plunge and extended suffrage to women as well, ever more voices within the Legislative Assemblies have come out in support of the idea, especially among the ranks of the PNT and, to an extent, among the PNL as well. With recent debates on this issue having come up more and more often, becoming more and more heated, perhaps it is indeed the time to proceed?"

So influential the King could not afford to simply ignore it any longer. Already somewhat mollified on the issue due to his appreciation of the fairer sex, the King's modernistic agenda and eye for opportunities spied a chance; granting women the right to vote in the Constitution would certainly increase his popularity and would increase Romania's standing in the world. And in his magnanimity, he has granted the right to vote to women as well, enshrining it in his new Constitution, forever to stand as a monument of his generosity!"
 romania.184.a: "Praise be to His Majesty King Carol, the Emancipator of Women!"
 romania.185.t: "Mota Releases a Book"
 romania.185.d: "The Captain's brother-in-law and co-founder of the Legionary Movement, Ion Mota, has been at Codreanu's side for a long time; in the Legion's earliest days, he often was a bigger theorist of its beliefs than the Captain himself, who preferred to mantain a degree of flexibility in order to enhance the Legion's chances.\n\nNow, after the successful publication of For My Legionaries, Mota has released a book of his own, titled Cranii de lemn (Wooden Skulls), title taken from an article commemorating the death of a Legionary, killed in the movement's early days and having his death masked behind \"wooden language\". Containing a collection of Mota's most important articles on varying issues, from the origins of the Legion among nationalist studentry to the necessity of Greater Hungary's dismantlement, all the way to the mundane like miracles attributed to the Archangel Michael. Acting as a microcosm of Legionary beliefs, especially of its \"old guard\" agraro-mysticist side, the book has become very popular among Legionary circles, strengthening the reach of the so-called \"Old Guard\"."
 romania.185.a: "Intriguing."
 romania.186.t: "Cantacuzino Releases His Study"
 romania.186.d: "Prince Alexandru Cantacuzino, rising star of the Legionary Movement and de facto intellectual leader of its more radical caucuses, has further cemented his status as a leading Legionary intellectual via the release of his new book, \"Intre lumea legionara si lumea sindicalista\" (Between The Legionary World and the Syndicalist World). Building upon his speeches of past student congresses like Romanul de maine (The Romanian of Tomorrow), he also compares the varying ideological systems of Totalism, Kemalism, Savinkovism, the Volkish movement and Balbian National Populism, as well as discussing Dostoyevsky, Berdyaev, Barrès and Jaurès. While he does acknowledge some similarities between the goals of Syndicalism and the Legionary Movement (namely, rejecting the nineteenth century's liberal tradition, abolishing social injustice, bank feudalism, privileges and capital speculations), he also sharply differentiates the movement from the Syndicalists in that they are considered worshippers of Marx, Proudhon and Pouget, builders of a second Tower of Babel who try to replace Christianity with atheism. Cantacuzino also considers that the Syndicalists are inhumane, annihilating the individual's personality and considering him as a means to an end, while Legionarism instead cares for their fellow peers and their physical and spiritual health, while also nurturing them and preparing the nation to \"stand at the borders of Romanianism, ready to defend and elevate the creations of the Romanian genius to the death\", an \"internal revolution\" against a \"mechanical society\".\n\nThe volume has proven to be a success among the Movement, giving further influence and intellectual backing to its radical caucus, with its emphasis on palingenetic rhetoric in the detriment of the mysticist element having further solidified Cantacuzino's standing as a Legionary theorist, and widened the intellectual horizon of the movement."
 romania.186.a: "The Green Prince widens his grasp."
 romania.187.t: "The Old Guard Grows Powerful"
 romania.187.d: "Despite being more limited numerically, the Old Guard of the Legion has dramatically increased its intellectual influence among the movement, with newer recruits also beginning to adopt some of its agrarian and mysticist ideas. Articles written by long-time members like Ion Mota or somewhat younger members, but very influenced by them like Vasile Marin, have become more and more common among the Movement's rank and file, with the agrarian-mysticist zeal of the \"Founders\" beginning to influence even factory workers, the Legionary Worker Corps' typical demographic, who weren't as interested in this side of the movement beforehand.\n\nWhile the Captain can't help but admire to an extent that his brother-in-law and old comrade in arms is re-entrenching the guiding principles of the Legionary Movement among its adherents, he cannot help but notice that the intellectual and theoretical centre is beginning to drift towards Mota once more. To prevent sidelining, some support of the other factions would prove most useful."
 romania.187.a: "Nothing stands in the way of faith. It prevails."
 romania.187.b: "How do they dare to challenge the Captain?"
 romania.188.t: "The Legionary Worker Corps Grows in Influence"
 romania.188.d: "With Romania's growing industrialisation, the Legion decided to accommodate it by shifting some of its focus towards attracting factory workers, and in practically all regard, it worked. Almost too well, in fact, for many of these workers, seeking to improve their condition and being easily riled up and filled with revolutionary zeal, have become extremely influential within the Movement as a whole.\n\nIn spite of Mota and Cantacuzino managing to further some of these new members' devotion to the Movement in their own manners, the fact still remains that these new members have dramatically increased the influence of Gheorghe Clime and his ally, Horia Sima's influence in the party, much to Codreanu's surprise and, to an extent, irritation. In order to prevent any sidelining, measures of restructuring, membership roll limiting and probation-enhancing would have to be taken, as well as courting some of the other intellectual caucuses within the Movement."

 romania.188.b: "Their place is to follow, not to lead."
 romania.189.t: "The Radicals Strengthen their Reach"
 romania.189.d: "In spite of constituting a fringe of sorts within the Legionary Movement, the caucus formed around Alexandru Cantacuzino and his ANI-inspired ideas has recently become far more influential than its size would ordinarily have it be. A combination of zeal and literary activity by the firebrand noble have expanded their intellectual reach, leading to new recruits and some older ones alike adopting at least some of their ideals.\n\nEven though Cantacuzino is part of the Captain's trusted inner circle, and can be trusted to not try to sideline his authority, the growth of the radical caucus' popularity is worrying Codreanu. While he can rein in the Legionaries that are close to him, those further from the central reach may be more vulnerable to subversion and may get unsavoury ideas, to say nothing of the fact these new doctrinary evolutions jeopardise the ideals of the original founders' struggle. It may be time to approach some of the other caucuses as well."

 romania.190.t: "The Old Fighter's Ascension"
 romania.190.d: "Stepping inside the Captain's office, Ion Mota felt something was amiss the moment he laid eyes upon his brother-in-law. The man who once stood as straight as a fir with a gaze like the stars, was tired, holding his face in his hands, seemingly meditating. For a moment, Mota thought of stepping out and leaving his comrade be, but then Codreanu's deep voice rang out:\n\n\"Take a seat, Ionel.\"\n\nSensing a part of the fighter he once knew in that sentence, Mota headed towards his brother-in-law and sat down in front of his desk.\n\n\"You sent for me, Captain?\"\n\n\"Let's dispense with the formalities, Ionel. And I did indeed. For I have a very special mission to give you.\"\n\n\"I'm listening, Cornel.\"\n\nCodreanu put his hands down and looked at Mota again.\n\n\"It's very tiresome, Ionel. Having to both rule the country and to try to rein in the Movement. I know that Our Lord Jesus Christ faced worse hardships on the Road of Golgotha, and I acknowledge that before His suffering, my woes are petty; but having to divide my attention like that is proving too hard for me.\"\n\n\"I see. You want someone to take away the bitter chalice, just as our Lord prayed in the Gospels.\"\n\n\"Yes; and that someone must be you. You have been my right hand all along, fought and suffered with me and the movement through thick and thin. I have noticed that your writings and those inspired by our Vacaresti days have become influential, and you have taken very well to the responsibilities of governance during my time as President of the Council of Ministers.\"\n\nMota paused for a second. \"Cornel, if you wish it, I will take on the mantle you pass to me, but what will happen to you? The Legion without its Captain may as well not exist.\"\n\n\"I will retreat for some time to the Rarau Mountains and then focus myself solely on leading the Movement. All I ask of you is to listen to my advice when I give it.\"\n\n\"I shall, Cornel. I shall.\"\n\nAnd thus, the favourite Disciple took the mantle of the Captain."
 romania.190.a: "May the Archangel Michael guide us to further victories."
 romania.191.t: "The Commander Takes The Mantle"
 romania.191.d: "With measured step and bated breath, Horia Sima, the unlikely candidate, the Transylvanian organiser who rose through the ranks and became a frontman of the ever-growing Legionary Worker Caucus, stepped into the Captain's office, and cast a quick gaze at the man sitting behind the desk. The Captain, a symbol of the Movement, of the triumph of faith and of perseverance, now hobbled by exhaustion behind a desk, playing a role he wasn't meant for.\n\n\"You requested to see me, Captain?\"\n\n\"Indeed I did, Sima. Take a seat.\"\n\nAnd Sima did.\n\n\"Horia, if you pardon my usage of your name, you have grown very powerful within the Movement. Your skills in organising the movement beyond the Carpathians alongside Ion Mota have been most impressive, and your zeal reminds me of the faith of Saint Paul after the Road to Damascus.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my Captain, but I'm sure you called me here for another reason other than complimenting me.\"\n\nCodreanu lets out a slight smile before continuing. \"I have. Having to handle both the Movement and the Country at the same time is proving taxing, and I would like to divest myself of some of the burden. I desire to retreat for a time to the Rarau Mountains and then return to leading the movement. However the country... you have proven yourself worthy of continuing my mission.\"\n\nSima appears somewhat shocked at first but quickly comes to his senses. \"You would grant me this big of an honour, Captain?\"\n\n\"I would. Would you accept it?\"\n\n\"It would be my honour to do so, Captain.\"\n\n\"Excellent. My sole request is for you to heed my advice whenever it may come. I may take a step back from governing, but my role in the Great Legionary Victory is not finished just yet.\"\n\n\"A request I shall carry out. By your will the country will be as bright as the Sun in the Sky!\"After this fateful conversation, he knew he was no longer just Horia Sima. He was something new and greater; the Commander, upholder of the Captain's will to the very end."
 romania.191.a: "Like Horea guided the peasants, so shall Sima guide the country."
 romania.192.t: "The Green Prince Takes Command"
 romania.192.d: "Befitting his title and noble ancestry, Prince Alexandru Cantacuzino cautiously enters the room he was called to, the office of the Captain he had devoted his life to. When he heard the Captain wished to see him, he hurriedly made his way to his side, and now here he stood, before the guide of the Romanian nation.\n\n\"Alecu, I am glad to see you arrived safe and sound.\"\n\n\"The Holy Archangel guided my steps, Captain. Now, you desired to see me?\"\n\n\"Of course. Take a seat, Alecu. We have a matter to discuss.\"\n\nObediently taking his seat, Cantacuzino couldn't help but think back to his family's history. If a Cantacuzene of ages past was ordered around and carried it out so obediently, whoever ordered was a figure most powerful. And he knew the Captain was indeed powerful, for he took the Legion from almost nothing and took it to the heights of power, just as the disciples of Christ were few in number but then spread.\n\n\"Alecu, your name is very noble, and your ancestors have sought the welfare of our nation, in spite of their foreign origin. You are one of those men who are born to rule, and I have a task of rulership to grant you.\"\n\n\"A task of rulership, Captain?\"\n\n\"I desire to entrust upon you the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. Leading the Legion and the Country at the same time is proving strenuous, and I need to focus only on one of these for a time. Your dedication to the Cause and your men's zeal, which reminds me of the Martyrs, have proven to me you are indeed worthy of this massive task.\"\n\nCantacuzino was taken aback. \"But, Captain, I am naught but an executioner of your will.\"\n\n\"Are we not all naught before the Host of the Heavens? Are we not all naught before the visage of Our Lord, before the sword of the Archangel Michael? And yet, we men still rise and rule over countries, as justly as we can.\"\n\nAfter a slight pause, Cantacuzino answers \"Very well. I accept.\"\n\nAnd thus the Green Prince took his sceptre."
 romania.192.a: "As the Captain's star fades, Cantacuzino's shines."
 romania.193.t: "A Grand Conference"
 romania.193.d: "The last few weeks have been a flurry of activity as the halls of the Green House have been prepared for a conference between the Captain of the Legionary Movement, Corneliu Codreanu, and certain high-ranking members of the movement, from Ion Mota and Radu Mironovici to the firebrand Prince Cantacuzino, all the way to the Worker Corps' representatives like Gheorghe Clime and Horia Sima. After being seated, the invitees were left alone in order to wait for the Captain's arrival.\n\n\"Ion, why do you think we were called here?\"\n\n\"I don't quite know Radu, but it must be important given the audience.\"\n\nAll chatter stopped as soon as the doors opened, revealing the Captain himself. Clad in a folk suit and determinedly gazing forward, he confidently strode in before seating himself before everyone. After crossing himself and saying a silent prayer, he began to speak:\n\n\"Legionaries. Comrades. I declare that recently I have been under heavy duress, owing to my duties to the Legion and the Fatherland. However, I had a dream; I had to visit the country as I did in ages past, so I did. I saw the golden fields of Muntenia, the rolling hills of my native Moldova, the voivodal forests of Bucovina, the Carpathians and Transylvania. I have seen my beloved Rarau once again. I have gained insight once again as to why I raised the battle cry all those years ago and why I fight today.\n\nI have also realised that factionalism, that scourge which has torn apart the country for so long, has re-emerged within our ranks. Though not as pronounced, it still has the potential to tear us apart. Well, not anymore. I hereby declare that I will not step down, though I will appoint some of you as vice-premiers to ease the burden. A cabinet restructuring will also take place, and I will also reform the Legion's organisation to further our unity. Division is not acceptable within my ranks.\"\n\nThe conference continued, and at the end the Legion left the halls more united than ever."

 romania.194.d: "Immediately following the reading of the Declaration of Independence in Parliament by Mihail Kogalniceanu on the 9th of May, the 10th of May has bore witness not just to its adoption by then-Domn Carol I, but also to the arrival of that same Carol in Romania in 1866 and his acclamation as Domn, as well as to the coronation of Carol I as King in 1881, Romania thus became a Kingdom. Thus laden with history, the 10th of May was designated as the National Day, being joyously celebrated within the Kingdom to this day, in spite of its short-lived prohibition by German occupational authorities during the Weltkrieg.\n\nThis year has proven to be not that different in that regard, as celebrations sweep the nation once more, with whatever divisions present within the country being temporarily buried, replaced by a common sentiment of belonging and national unity. Crowds in Bucharest attend the military parade within the Capital, as smaller-scale parades ensue within other provincial capitals. The day continues with other cultural activities before culminating with a royal speech and fireworks displays all across the country."

 romania.195.t: "The Feast of the Holy Archangels"
 romania.195.d: "In Eastern Orthodox liturgics, the 8th of November bears witness to the Feast of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel, as well as the other bodiless powers of Heaven. Across the country and beyond many people celebrate their name days, many others their birthdays even.\n\nNone however celebrate as proudly as the Legion of the Archangel Michael, whose dedication to the Commander of the Hosts of Heaven has driven Captain Codreanu to declare their patron’s feast day as a movement-wide celebration. Nest meetings on the day were dedicated to commemorating their heavenly patron, many areas held demonstrations and parades on the day, before culminating with Divine Liturgy attendance. Many churches report spikes in attendance, driven by the movement’s more pious members.\n\n[GetSecondInCommand] himself joined in the celebrations, sending celebratory messages and greetings to members and local organisations throughout the country, before attending the liturgy in Bucharest at his favourite church, St. Ilie Gorgani."
 romania.195.a: "The Archangel watches."
 romania.196.t: "Rethinking Our Administration"
 romania.196.d: "A significant part of the National Peasants’ Party hails from Transylvania, origin that has affected many of their members’ outlooks on affairs, especially on local administration. Prominent PNT member Iuliu Maniu is a known advocate of administrative reform, considering the autonomy of local governance, be it rural or urban, as the foundation for a fair and modern administration.\n\nWith the PNT now in power, Maniu’s proposals have become far more than just electoral mutter; the party has the chance to begin implementing reforms, starting with the creation of seven directories which will take some of the government’s attributions when dealing with the local administration. While quite a way off from melding the best of the Old Kingdom’s administration with that of Transylvania, it is seen as a good start, and it remains to be seen how the party will follow up on the promised reforms."
 romania.196.a: "Implement some of the reforms."
 romania.196.b: "Tear up the old system and step into the modern age."
 romania.196.c: "Let's not push it any further."
 romania.197.t: "Royal Administrative Reforms"
 romania.197.d: "Conscious of the administrative problems sparked by Romania’s administrative divisions, and taking advantage of a stream of pro-decentralisation political sentiment expressed in past years, His Majesty the King has implemented an administrative reform of his own. While the counties were mantained, a new form of administrative division, the “tinut” (region) was created, with the counties divided between ten regions. Many of the counties’ powers and attributions were transferred to the regions, which were placed under the supervision of royal residents, appointed centrally. The development of more regional economic centres will certainly help propel the nation forward, and the administrative strain of dealing with the old seventy-one counties will not be missed, especially once fully replaced by ten regions."
 romania.197.a: "A sensible step forward!"
 romania.197.b: "That's not enough - we will remake the system entirely."
 romania.198.t: "The Prodigal Brother"
 romania.198.d: "The King’s younger brother, Prince Nicolae, typically did not involve himself as much in politics as his more bombastic brother, but lately rumours have begun to swirl around him. While this ordinarily would not be a cause for concern for Carol, a fair few of these rumours have him courting the Legionary Movement, be it from simply donating to giving them access to various properties he acquires.\n\nThe feud between the two brothers started over Nicolae’s romantic preferences; having met Lady Ioana Doletti and having fallen in love, he desired to marry her; a wish his regal brother denied, which Nicolae felt was hypocritical as Carol himself had a mistress, while Carol defends himself saying that he was not going to marry Lupescu and tarnish the honour of the Royal House in the manner Nicolae would by marrying Doletti; a deed he allegedly has already done in secret. It is said that Lupescu’s dislike of Doletti, as well as Nicolae’s dislike of the atmosphere around the King’s circle of associates also further complicates matters."
 romania.198.a: "A mole in the King’s own household? We must keep an eye on him."
 romania.198.b: "An ally in the Palace? Most welcome."
 romania.199.t: "Marriage or Duty?"
 romania.199.d: "Following the end of Carol’s power struggle with the Legionary Movement, the King felt the time has come to properly address the issue of his wayward brother, Prince Nicolae. Feeling that his secret wife, Ioana Doletti, has led him to lose his way and become embroiled in conflicts he can’t even understand that would lead him to ruin more than anything else, the King decided to act in order to solve this dynastic issue.\n\nAt the King’s request, the President of the Council of Ministers, Armand Călinescu, had a letter penned to Nicolae, asking him to clarify a “state of affairs that cannot continue without severe harm to dynastic prestige and authority”. In effect, asking him to choose between membership in the Royal House and his marriage. After severe consternation, Nicolae chose his marriage.\n\nThe King proceeded to summon the Crown Council, which after a discussion released a communique declaring that Nicolae’s status as a member of the Royal House was terminated. In his private diary, however, Carol wrote that he didn’t want it to end this way, that he didn’t want to have to carry out this exclusion himself, but Nicolae’s behaviour forced his hand."
 romania.199.a: "Unfortunate, but necessary."
 romania.200.t: "The Woes of an Ever-Growing Host"
 romania.200.d: "To an outside observer, the Legion may seem triumphant; for it has risen from a handful of men centred around their leader to one of the most powerful groups in Romania; however, in spirit, the Legion never truly ceased to be a group of men centred around their leader, owing to its very person-centric leadership style.\n\nHowever, even though this leadership manner has proven itself useful in creating a core of highly-loyal adepts, and adepts gained via the Legion's specific brand of \"personal\" conversion tend to speak highly of this event, it has its limits. Namely, that the Legion's popularity is undermining it. The more members that sign up, the more they have to be kept in check to follow Codreanu's strict standards, a task that has to be balanced with actually ruling the country. Although attempts are made to control this phenomenon via probation periods and limiting the number of people allowed to ascend into the Legion proper from the “outer Party”, the influx is slowly fraying its Captain’s capacity of maintaining his hold.\n\nThis member influx has also proven conductive to the development of factions within the Legion’s ranks, with three “strains” of thought becoming the most relevant: the “Old Guard”, standard-bearers of the early days’ student mysticism and agrarian populism, centred on Legion co-founder Ion Mota; the “Legionary Workers’ Corps”, geared more towards urban worker interests and having a more social-revolutionary leaning and centred around LWC leader Gheorghe Clime and Transylvanian organiser Horia Sima; and finally, the radicals, who combine elements of established Legionary thought with parts of other National-Populist ideologies, especially the ANI in the Italian Republic, with this group being centred on Legionary rising star and firebrand Alexandru Cantacuzino.\n\nAs the Legion heads towards ever greater heights, it remains to be seen if one of these strands of thought will become dominant or if its Captain will once more achieve the seemingly-impossible and re-centre the movement around his leadership."
 romania.200.a: "By the Archangel, we will prevail!"
 romania.201.t: "A Monarchic Question"
 romania.201.d: "With King Carol II gone, a question has arisen regarding his succession. Under normal circumstances, his son Mihai would inherit the throne, and many consider that his youth and seeming docility would make him an ideal candidate to succeed his father. However, many attendees of Crown Councils have said that Mihai is more sympathetic to the idea of democracy and a constitutional monarchy, and may prove himself to be uncooperative. The solution they propose would be to make a deal with Prince Nicolae, who, in addition to not being interested in politics, has shown some sympathies to our cause. In exchange for modifying the Royal House Statute to legitimise his marriage to Ioana Doletti, he would gladly take the throne, however this power grab may cause some image damage. What should the course of action be?"
 romania.201.a: "Follow the line of succession and enthrone Crown Prince Mihai."
 romania.201.b: "A sympathetic monarch would be of far more use, summon Prince Nicolae!"
 romania.202.t: "An Island, Alone"
 romania.202.d: "The island of Ada Kaleh is an oddity in that it remained an enclave of the Ottoman Empire long after it got pushed away from the Danube frontier; an oddity that seemingly got undone after the Austrian occupation of the island, but de jure it still was legally a domain of the Sultan.\n\nHowever, with the outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East, and the Ottomans being preoccupied with the conflict there, and the Austrians’ withdrawal of troops post-Black Monday, the island stood alone; an Ottoman possession in the middle of the Danube, a relic of ages past. A relic which Romania saw as far more useful in its hands than outside them.\n\nRapidly establishing control over the small islet, Romanian authorities proclaimed that the island is officially part of Romania, but also that the local populace's rights shall be respected. It remains to be seen how Ottoman authorities will react to this transgression."
 romania.202.a: "An anachronism, corrected."
 romania.202.b: "Damn you!"
 romania.203.t: "The Ottomans Protest"
 romania.203.d: "In spite of being preoccupied with their war in the Middle East, the Ottoman government has indeed found time to pen a letter of complaint to the Romanian government, expressing frustration over the seizure of Ada Kaleh.\n\nFortunately however, the island’s small size and distance from the Ottoman mainland, pressing concerns closer to home and the negligible benefit in holding it have swayed the Ottoman government to not pursue further action in the matter. While the Sultan was not happy over the island’s loss, the island’s days of importance are long past, and any conflict over the island was deemed as pointless.\n\nThe Romanian government has expressed relief over this reaction, and has stated its openness for a prospective détente with the Ottoman Empire in the future."
 romania.203.a: "It would not have been worth any conflict anyway."
 romania.204.t: "The Ceding of Ada Kaleh"
 romania.204.d: "With the Ottoman Government’s recent announcement of a policy of reconciliation with the Balkan states, the matter of the island of Ada Kaleh has sprung to the forefront of negotiations with Romania.\n\nA small island in the Danube whose defensive importance is long past, it now functions as a de jure part of the Ottoman Empire, who in spite of still sending officials to govern it in the Sultan’s name, doesn’t appear to have much interest in the detached island anymore. However, Romania has shown interest in obtaining control over it, and has pledged itself to mantain the island’s privileges.\n\nAnd so, in a ceremony on the Island proper, a treaty was signed formally ceding the island to Romania, with residents and officials alike watching the Ottoman flag be lowered from Ada Kaleh for the last time, replaced with the Romanian tricolour. In a speech, the foreign minister of Romania has pledged to safeguard the island’s traditions, announcing that the King himself has taken interest in the island and will visit it soon enough; an event said by some islanders to be foretold in a dream."
 romania.204.a: "We will steward it well."
 romania.204.b: "God be with you, Ada Kaleh."
 romania.205.t: "The King’s Visit"
 romania.205.d: "The day said to be foretold in a dream has finally arrived; His Majesty the King has come to visit Ada Kaleh. Guided on a tour of the island by the island’s mayor and local entrepreneur Ali Kadri, the King and his entourage have visited the ruins of the old star fort, the local village, the mosque, the house of local figure Niyazi Suleiman, and enjoyed cups of traditionally-brewed coffee at a local cafe.\n\nListening to the islanders’ pleas, the King spoke the words ”You may return to your homes in peace. From now on, you will have back your privileges, and all my care.” and formally restored the island’s privileges of customs tax and conscription exemption. A local company owned by Ali Kadri was granted a licence to import luxury goods including tobacco, coffee, sugar, alcohol and cigarettes, with the tobacco and cigarette licence being especially significant owing to the existence of the state monopoly on tobacco. An arrangement was also codified into Romanian law where half the company’s profits were assigned for the upkeep and modernisation of the island, with the other half divided out equally as a small subsidy to every one of its residents. Upon hearing the news, the residents rejoiced, with the date of the King’s visit becoming enshrined as a local holiday."
 romania.205.a: "Praise His Majesty’s judgement!"
 romania.206.t: "The Coronation of Prince Nicolae"
 romania.206.d: "The throne of Romania sees a new holder, as now-King Nicolae I formally takes it in a ceremony in Bucharest.\n\nThe new king started off by taking the oath in private at the Royal Palace, after which he, accompanied by his wife and a big entourage, with heavy Greenshirt presence scattered throughout, Nicolae first headed towards Metropolitanate Hill, where a tribune was set up, imitating the one used in King Carol I’s own coronation ceremony. There, a religious ceremony was held, after which the royal entourage headed towards the Royal Palace, where, after being congratulated by various diplomats and holding a speech, Nicolae put the Steel Crown on his own head, before crowning his wife with the Crown of Queen Elisabeta. The following days are scheduled to host military reviews and parades by representants of the counties of Romania, with the festivities slated to culminate with another coronation at Alba Iulia.\n\nAlongside the King, many high-ranking members of the Legionary Movement could be seen, many of whom had a veneer of satisfaction as they watched the ceremony unfold. What the future holds for Romania’s new king, who allegedly is not too interested in politics, is uncertain."
 romania.206.a: "국왕 폐하 만세!"
 romania.207.t: "Direction of the Transylvanian Chapters"
 romania.207.d: "Before the Unification was achieved, the Transylvanian chapters of the Legionary Movement were generally grouped under regional organisers, ultimately answering to Ion Mota, who then reported back to the Captain himself.\n\nNow however, with the Union having finally been accomplished, the Transylvanian chapters are beginning to clamour for reorganisation, to better integrate them within the structure of the Movement at large. As Codreanu is for now focused more on the Old Kingdom, whomsoever gets control over the vast and growing Transylvanian chapters will become very influential within the Movement as a whole. A host of CML-aligned members of the Committee of the Thousand have proposed granting Horia Sima, a regional organiser in the Banat area who has made overtures to the group in the past, control over the Transylvanian chapters, citing his experience in organising the West. The Legionary Senate however, more influenced by the Old Guard, has proposed continuing Mota’s tenure, citing his incumbency and his vital role in setting up the Transylvanian organisations. Of course, the Captain could also try to satisfy both and grant Mota control over the inner Transylvanian chapters and Sima control over the West, reducing the chances of an unified Transylvanian bloc emerging and safeguarding his own influence in the process."
 romania.207.a: "Mota is loyal and trustworthy; he will continue his tenure."
 romania.207.b: "Sima’s experience will make the Transylvanian chapters more efficient."
 romania.207.c: "A united bloc would be too big a danger; split it up."
 romania.208.t: "The Old Guard Coalises"
 romania.208.d: "Safeguarding Mota’s tenure over the Transylvanian chapters of the Legionary Movement, while a successful move in terms of binding the chapters across the Carpathians, has also given the so-called “Old Fighter” caucus a great deal of influence. Due to having almost free rein in spreading their view of Legionary ideology across the Carpathians, the share of Legionary members adhering to the Old Guard’s tenets of agrarian populism tinged with heavily Orthodox mysticism-inspired rhetoric has dramatically grown. While Mota is loyal to his brother-in-law, he and other members of this caucus have become emboldened, and their likeliness to talk back to Codreanu over decisions he wants to make has grown accordingly."
 romania.208.a: "Concerning."
 romania.209.t: "The Workers Rally"
 romania.209.d: "With Sima in charge of the Transylvanian chapters, it seems his courting of the Legionary Worker Corps has borne fruit, for their influence beyond the Carpathians has dramatically begun to increase. Canteens and legionary shops are being set up in industrial towns, giving the CML ideal opportunities to begin swaying factory workers to their cause, activities that they basically have free rein on. While the other groups still have adherents beyond the mountains, many urban centres of Transylvania seem poised to become LWC strongholds. While their loyalty to the Captain is still secure, it remains to be seen how this situation will develop, especially considering that the new members seem very driven towards revolutionary strands of thought..."
 romania.209.a: "Most worrisome."
 romania.210.t: "Question of the Intelligence Service"
 romania.210.d: "The Legionary Movement, already atypical amongst organisations of its kind, also took the daring step of creating its own internal intelligence service, the SIMLR - Serviciul de Informatii al Miscarii Legionare din Romania; the Informations Service of the Legionary Movement of Romania-. While a relatively small organisation and nowhere near as efficient as the state intelligence service, it nevertheless helps ensure internal cohesion among the movement’s ranks. With the expansion of Legionary power and influence however, many members, especially those affiliated with the radical caucus, want to expand its capacities, turning it into a full-fledged auxiliary of the SSI - Serviciul Special de Informaţii; the Special Informations Service-, to be led by Horia Cosmovici, protege of Sima and Cantacuzino. Other voices within the movement, including the SIMLR’s current leader, Ion Belgea, clamour that tangling with the SSI would only result in bureaucratic tanglings and would hamper its efficiency, and that if the SSI were to be roused, it could undermine us from its very lofty position."
 romania.210.a: "Expand it to an auxiliary intelligence service and appoint Cosmovici to lead it!"
 romania.210.b: "This may be too dangerous a gamble, keep it reduced and mantain Belgea."
 romania.211.t: "An Auxiliary Police Force?"
 romania.211.d: "Although the Movement reigns supreme in Romania at this moment, concerns have been raised over just how loyal the Police could be within the new State. In spite of the Movement’s control of the Ministry of the Interior, the Police proper still has not had the best of relationships with the Legionaries, as immortalised in the killing of police prefect Manciu back in the early 1920’s.\n\nAn unlikely solution has emerged, especially pushed by the Movement’s radicals, aided along by LWC sympathisers: create a special auxiliary police force, recruited from amongst Movement members, which is to collaborate with the regular police force in a variety of matters. Supporters consider that this will further strengthen the Movement’s power and will be of use towards achieving the Legionary Victory, while opponents consider that its very vaguely-defined capacities and powers will only lead to abuses, and to the Romanian people losing faith in the Legion as its national and spiritual guiding force, claiming that arresting people on a whim is not what the Captain would desire. What should be done in this debate?"
 romania.211.a: "Establish the Legionary Police, and appoint General Petrovicescu to lead it!"
 romania.211.b: "We risk becoming that which we fought against; focus on reforming the regular police instead."
 romania.212.t: "A Crumbling House of Cards"
 romania.212.d: "Back in the 1920’s, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and a bunch of followers split from the National-Christian Defence League, led by A.C Cuza, to form his new political movement, which would grow into the Legionary Movement. However, now it seems that his own turn as face of the Romanian ultranationalist right may be ending in fire just as A.C Cuza’s did.\n\nFew could predict that the seemingly-ascendant Legion of the Archangel Michael would begin to share its forebear’s fate, but the signs have grown ever clearer over the past months. Its growing size began to work against it, as the Legion began to host different caucuses and factions within itself, arguing over precise points of Legionary doctrine and interpreting various points in their own manner. While its Captain could keep control for a time, he still had moments where it seemed he could lose control over his movement’s future. And now, he sees his control unravel in a crisis worse than he had ever seen before, as the infighting within the Legionary Movement is beginning to reach a fever pitch, with internal disputes wreaking havoc within the organisation’s stability and more and more members beginning to split apart from it.\n\nWhether this was caused by his own failings or by a specific stream of thought becoming too dominant is unclear, but one thing is certain; it would take a great effort to try and correct the course now. Codreanu’s own advisors have begun to hint that he should take a step back and embrace a more spiritual role in the Legion’s leadership and leave one of his trusted subordinates as political head, but some voices still consider that the Captain will be able to call upon divine providence this time as well and bring the chaos to an end. With the pressure and stress mounting upon Codreanu, already troubled by this turn of events, it remains to be seen what he will do to restore cohesion."
 romania.212.a: "Perhaps Mota's Old Guard can help us."
 romania.212.c: "Let's strike a deal with Sima and his supporters..."
 romania.212.e: "We have to compromise with Cantacuzino after all."
 romania.212.b: "God will grant us victory through this trial as well!"
 romania.213.t: "전쟁의 신"
 romania.213.d: "Our decision to focus on modernised artillery has proved fruitful. Modern guns, new fire control methods and practical experiences from the Bulgarian war have taught our brightest minds valuable lessons in artillery warfare of the modern age. Nations lacking in numbers must strive to focus on quality over quantity, and our greatest quality shall be our god of war, the Resita artillery gun."
 romania.213.a: "Hungarians better watch the horizon!"
 romania.213.b: "We have other priorities."
 romania.214.t: "Green Prince's Ascension"
 romania.214.d: "Finally entire Romania is in the hands of the Green Prince. Venerable Captain has tasked us to safeguard his legacy and his vision of Greater Romania, but Alexandru Cantacuzino is a man of great ambition. Some of the more radical wing calls for him to take total control over the country and disassemble entire rotten structure, but there's great many of those who would want to stay in the path the Captain has prepared for us.\n\nWe are in a position to take absolute control, should we desire so - but it would mean breaking apart much of what Codreanu had built before his resignation from the government. On the other hand, no great nation was built without demolishing old structures and building them anew."
 romania.214.a: "Rest assured, dear Captain, we will keep your vision."
 romania.214.b: "We won't stay in the Captain's shadow!"
 romania.215.t: "A Visit to Putna"
 romania.215.d.carol: "With the integration of Bucovina in the Romanian state, the monastery of Putna lies once more on Romanian soil, fact which was quickly noticed and seized upon by many political figures, including His Majesty the King.\n\nIn a very publicised visit, the King, his Council of Ministers, the Patriarch and the Crown Prince have journeyed to the region, visiting, among others, the monasteries of Bucovina and immersing themselves within their history, from Voronet to Sucevita, culminating in a visit to the resting place of Stephen the Great of Moldova, at the Putna Monastery.\n\nAfter paying their respects at the Voivode’s grave, the King, accompanied by his suite, held a speech commemorating the return of Bucovina and the remains of Stephen the Great to Romanian soil, and pledging to make sure that the voivode’s remains will not be estranged from Romania ever again."
 romania.215.d.legion: "With the integration of Bucovina in the Romanian state, the monastery of Putna lies once more on Romanian soil, which the Legionary Movement was quick to capitalise upon.\n\nIn a heavily-publicised visit to the area, the Captain, Corneliu Codreanu, accompanied by many members of the Legion, toured the monasteries of the region, the cave of Daniil the Hermit, and many other areas, culminating in a visit to the resting place of the voivode Stephen the Great, at the Putna Monastery.\n\nAfter paying his respects at the Voivode’s grave and attending Liturgy, the Captain held a speech where he thanked God for the momentous return of the voivode’s remains to Romania, as well as the integration of Cernauti, where his father, Ion Zelea Codreanu, hailed from. Then he promised that the Legion shall follow the example of Stephen the Great and defend the country from any enemy that shall cross the border, before culminating in a vow to make sure the remains of Stephen the Great will never leave Romania again."
 romania.215.d.michael: "With the integration of Bucovina in the Romanian state, the Putna monastery lies once more on Romanian soil, something which was quickly noticed by the public sphere and commented upon by various political party leaders.\n\nIn order to more closely bind the area with the Romanian state, King [Root.GetLeader] and a suite consisting of his cabinet and leading politicians from the area have embarked on a tour of the region, from Suceava to Cernauti, immersing themselves in the region’s culture and visiting what the area has to offer, culminating in a publicised visit to the burial place of Stephen the Great, the Putna monastery.\n\nAfter paying homage to the dead prince, the King made a speech praising Stephen for his defence of the country and for having secured Moldova’s prosperity during his reign, and congratulated the people of Bucovina for holding firm to their identity under foreign rule, and concluded by pledging to continue safeguarding the province’s prosperity and integrity under Romanian rule, just as Stephen the Great safeguarded Moldova’s prosperity in ages past."
 romania.215.a: "May we fulfil our pledge."
 romania.215.b: "Bucovina shall never be lost again."
 romania.215.c: "The brothers shall never be divided anymore."
 romania.216.t: "The Persecution Commanderies"
 romania.216.d: "Even though the death of the so-called Captain did throw the Legionaries into disarray for some time, it seems they were more resilient than expected, with many of them regrouping into so-called “Persecution Commanderies” under various leaders.\n\nWhat especially makes these developments concerning is that without their leader’s command, the restraints he imposed on their behaviour have come loose; violence from their ranks is rising, and the Special Informations Service reports that there are whispers of an assassination plot. One bigger than most. Naturally, we have reasons to suspect it targets the King.\n\nAn emergency meeting of the Crown Council was called, and various solutions were proposed to this end. One idea is to cut down on Royal appearances outside the Palace and increase the Royal Guard detail when outside of its confines, although this may be seen by some elements of the people as a sign of cowardice. Another one, related to the previous one would be to temporarily delegate the King’s duties to the Council of Ministers, with the ministers taking up some of the visits and protocolary journeys the King has to do, albeit the risk with this idea is that the angered Legionaries would try gunning down one of them instead. Finally, Royal confidant and Bucharest Police Prefect Gabriel Marinescu, known critic of the Legionaries, suggests to place their trust in the Police, increasing their presence should the King be about and vastly increasing their competencies. Critics of this plan point that the Police may not necessarily be prepared to handle this issue, and the Legionaries have prior experience with dealing with Police members anyway. How should we proceed?"
 romania.216.a: "Ramp up the Guard Detail and cut down on travel outside the Palace."
 romania.216.b: "Delegate duties to the Ministers. Better for them to get shot than the King."
 romania.216.c: "Marinescu’s men can handle this. Fighting fire with fire - what could possibly go wrong?"
 romania.217.t: "Disaster Averted!"
 romania.217.d: "It would seem that staying in the Palace and vastly stepping up the Guard detail managed to deter the Archangel’s men from trying anything. While there was a certain Legionary presence on any Royal appearance, identifiable in spite of the lack of their well-known green shirt, the vast security detail managed to stop most of them from any rash action.\n\nMost, as there were groups that did try, however their members got repelled by the Royal Guards, with more than a few having died in the process. Even though the Legionaries have already started to honour them as martyrs, the chances they will try anything against the King’s person are only getting lower and lower."
 romania.217.a: "A toast to our brave Royal Guards!"
 romania.218.t: "Prime Minister Călinescu Wounded!"
 romania.218.d.a: "While the King’s safety has been indeed secured by the decision to transfer many of his duties and visit arrangements to the ministers, it appears the Legionaries have indeed caught on to the scheme. Whether they had a sympathiser in the Crown Council or just connected the dots from observation or from reading the newspapers is unknown, but they noticed that the ministers are indeed taking over Carol’s visit arrangements, and have switched targets: this time to President of the Council of Ministers and Interior Minister Armand Călinescu.\n\nHaving intercepted the minister’s vehicle, the assassins started firing, wounding the driver, the minister and his bodyguard, Radu Andone, however they were thwarted by the increased security preparations the minister carried out; a motorcade was waiting just nearby, and when they saw the in-progress attempt the police started firing themselves, giving Andone the opportunity to start firing himself, as much as he could with his injuries. The assassins were driven off, but Călinescu, Andone and the driver were wounded, and will need time to recover.\n\nWhile the victims were injured, we are confident they will survive. The Legion’s ambitions have been dampened on this day, as the attempted assassination of a Royal minister will certainly be enough impetus to intensify the offensive against them."

The minister’s bodyguard, Radu Andone, opened the door just enough to get shot in the shoulder, alerting him to the attackers’ presence in the worst way possible. The driver was sent off to alert the nearby motorcade, time in which both Călinescu and Andone were hard-pressed, Andone especially trying to repel the assasins by rolling down his window just enough to allow himself to fire his pistol while staying under cover. The reinforced glass, however, eventually gave way, resulting in the bodyguard and Prime Minister Călinescu being wounded by the time the motorcade and the policemen arrived at the scene and drove the assasins away.\n\nWhile the victims were injured, we are confident they will survive.

 romania.220.t: "Establishment Parties Call For Representation"
 romania.220.d: "After achieving almost total control over Romanian government, those politicians sidelined by the Legionaries are calling the King to relinquish control back to the parliament and allow new elections. This mostly liberal group of old establishment politicians and their supporters argue that King's coup was a welcome one to save the nation from Codreanu's thugs, but his royal dictatorship should be only temporal. The king himself disagrees, and with the parliament stacked with his loyalists, the opposition can merely hinder his reign."

This will not do.\n\nAt the behest of the King, a special committee consisting of Police Prefect Gabriel Marinescu, President of the Council of Minister and Minister of the Interior Armand Călinescu, General Gheorghe Argeşanu, Justice Minister Victor Iamandi, SSI Director Mihail Moruzov and many others, has been called up in order to begin ending the Legionary threat once and for all.\n\nAnd now, the plan springs into action.\n\nKnown members of the movement from all over the country are being arrested and taken for questioning, from the lowest recruit all the way to the Commanders of the Annunciation, with resistance being rewarded in kind. The press is running like clockwork destroying the image of the Movement, its leaders, and its beliefs. But all of this will not matter unless we cut off the serpent’s head as well.\n\n[czcdeadornot]\n\nMota, Cantacuzino and other high-ranking faces of the Guard were captured, although reports indicate that Sima is still at large, having managed to avoid the trap laid for him; having most probably been tipped off. His other colleagues however have not been as lucky, being captured in spite of their followers’ attempts to rescue them, and later on were found dead in custody. The Legionaries were quick to denounce their comrades’ „martyrdoms”, but we are sure that in time their resistance will taper."
 romania.221.a: "The archangel’s sword has been shattered."
 ROM_czc_not_present: "With Codreanu’s death, the movement has reorganised itself into a series of isolated chapters titled “Persecution Commanderies”, with certain leaders coordinating the entire network, among them former ministers Ion Mota and Alexandru Cantacuzino, as well as activist and regional organiser Horia Sima. Even though they have successfully went underground, they still issue periodical releases condemning the royal regime and calling for resistance. Fortunately, some informers have divulged some of its leaders’ routines and locations."
 ROM_czc_killed_in_prison: "Fortunately we have managed to locate their Captain, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, having gone into hiding near his mountainside retreat following the crackdown on his men. After observing his routine, he was intercepted and taken into custody. Some of his nearby followers attempted to rescue their leader, but the resulting shootout saw both them and Codreanu die. Having been trialled and convicted in absentia, this move will certainly deliver the death blow to his movement’s aspirations, although there are concerning reports that the Legionaries have condemned their Captain’s “martyrdom”."
 romania.222.t: "Great Union Day"
 romania.222.d: "A new holiday graces the calendars of Romania, for this fine day, [GetDateText] has been designated as the Great Union Day, celebrating the completion of the national unification process exactly one year ago!\n\nOnce more, the country drapes itself in blue, gold and red, as Romanians celebrate the tearing down of the final borders splitting their people apart. Parades, cookouts, friendly gatherings sweep the country from West to East, as children and adults alike celebrate the introduction of this new holiday. Whatever divisions there are in Romanian society temporarily dissipate in the aura of brotherhood that is being spread all around, as the sentiment of joy over no longer being split eclipses everything. With the last barriers of the Romanian people torn down, a sentiment of optimism ensconces itself among the populace; now that everyone is united, nothing can stand in the Romanian people's path to greatness.\n\nAs the day draws to a close, fireworks shows take place throughout the cities and towns, while people either withdraw for the day, content with the festivities, or continue celebrating into the night, joyous over the brotherly union."

 romania.223.t: "Twilight"
 romania.223.d: "Mihai woke up thinking today was going to be another dreary day. Another dreary day where his green-clad handlers would tell him what to sign and where, while not keeping him informed of just what was going on in his kingdom. He felt powerless; in his hand laid great power but he knew that exercising it was risky: while he could marshal the Royal Guards and segments of the Army to take back power, the Legionaries could simply shoot him or call up on their own contacts instead. And God only knew what would happen with him out of the picture.\n\nMaybe he would go to the planes today. Maybe he could talk some of them to allow him to attend to his flying lessons. Who knows, one day he could learn how to pilot himself. Give himself a suitable outlet for his anger at his situation, and maybe get an idea on how to act. A caged bird tasting freedom and refreshing its thoughts.\n\nThen suddenly he saw the door of his study open, and a throng of green-shirted men fill the room, led by that accursed man, Alexandru Cantacuzino. He could feel his stomach drop but he kept his face placid. He had to.\n\n\"Your Lordship. What brings you here today?\"\n\n\"Do not address me as such, Your Majesty.\" said Cantacuzino, leering as he addressed his monarch. \"We have very important business of state to conduct today.\"\n\n\"As always.\"\n\n\"So. On the first order of business... Your Majesty has something to sign.\" And with those words, Cantacuzino slipped a paper on the King's desk. Mihai felt his blood turn to ice the moment his eyes saw the pivotal words near the bottom."
 romania.223.a: "An act of abdication? What is the meaning of this?"

 romania.225.d: "\"The nerve on that brat, dismissing the Legionaries!\"\n\n\"Indeed, comrade. Unfortunately even the King has fallen victim to the machinations of those masons.\"\n\n\"He's supposed to embody the will of the nation huh? Doesn't he realise that we were the truest representation of its will, Victor? More than the liberal and peasantist robbers?\"\n\n\"Patience, Gabi. We may have taken a big setback, but our takeover is inevitable. If not now, then one day, the Romanian people will wake up. And see just what was taken away from them.\"\n\n\"True, comrade. One day we will repay them all.\"\n\nThe downfall of the Legionary Movement may have elated a certain amount of people, but there were a fair few who had not taken it lightly. Even though the Archangel's men took a significant blow to their organisation, the movement itself still lingers in the shadows, tailing the historic parties' every move, and plotting out courses of action. While not capable of rousing as many people as it could in its prime, it still has a fair few nostalgics, and the capacity to perpetuate itself. Romanian politics may be slowly easing themselves into a new more democratic norm, but the silent gaze of the Archangel's men will still be ever-present in the shadows, still adhering to the tenets of their Captain and his Commanders of the Annunciation."

 romania.226.t: "신헌법!"
 romania.226.d: "Celebrations sweep Parliament and the Green House as the Legionary Movement rejoices over the new constitution it plans to give to the country. Higher-ranked cadres are confident that the project will be approved by referendum, and usher in a new era for the Romanian nation.\n\nDrawing some inspiration from poporanist movements of ages past, the new Constitution firmly reinforces the guiding role of the Romanian people within the Romanian nation, as well as enshrining the fundamental value of property and land; albeit also establishing the State as a powerful power-broker in such matters by giving it a fair amount of power to seize, sell and distribute land. Parliament is also reorganised to include representatives of all worker, peasant, entrepreneur and professional associations, centring them on the Senate in addition to the senators by-right; the Deputies are elected still by party lists. The dominant role of the Orthodox and Uniate confessions is enshrined, while the centralistic principle of administration is tempered ever so slightly.\n\nAs the dominant party, the Legion is uniquely placed to position itself within the framework of this new system, creating an unique system blending some of the trappings of the old with the new. Few know what to expect of this new system, but the throngs of green-shirts certainly appear supportive of the project, seeing it as the capstone to their so-called \"Great Legionary Victory\"."

 romania.227.t: "신헌법!"
 romania.227.d: "Following the PNT's period of consolidation and governance, the time has come to finally revise the old Constitution of 1866, a deed which was carried out. After approval by the Legislating Chambers and the Sovereign, it is expected that the people will also approve it via referendum.\n\nInfluenced both by the old constitution and the views of theorists like Constantin Stere and Romul Boilă, the new constitution devotes vast space to defining and protecting individual rights, influenced by the British concept of habeas corpus. Centralisation, though still upheld, is tempered through local autonomy on the lowest levels, and the role of popular initiatives and referenda is increased. Not all provisions survived the discussion process however; the Superior Economic Council, the Unicameral Parliament and the idea of placing land use and repartition under State control did not make the revision.\n\nIts spirit however remained unscathed, and the frontment of the PNT are sure that their new constitution will be a major step forward towards a brighter future for Romania, as the nation moves forward as one."
 romania.227.a: "Hurrah for the new constitution of All Romanians!"
 romania.228.t: "신헌법!"
 romania.228.d: "Under the PNL's wise stewardship, a new constitution was drafted and approved. Honouring the dreams of the late Ionel Brătianu and King Ferdinand, the new constitution enshrines the new democratic system, as well as codifying the new developments of the years since the last constitutional adoption. It will be submitted to a referendum, which it will most likely pass.\n\nMany provisos of the old have been kept but modernised: the King still mantains extensive prerogatives like vetoing laws, issuing pardons and vetos, appointing and dismissing ministers, but he can exercise it only with the agreement of his ministers. For he reigns, but does not govern.\n\nRights previously enshrined were still codified, the status of the Romanian Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches as dominant faiths was enshrined, and, above all, the national and indivisible character of the Nation was solidified, further cementing the Great Union of all Romanians under one nation."
 romania.228.a: "At last, a new constitution!"

 romania.229.d: "\"Have you heard? The Legionaries, they were toppled!\"\n\n\"Eh, 'twas to be expected. Of course those damn Masons wouldn't let Codreanu clean up the mess.\"\n\n\"You don't realise what this means, Vasile? We're getting new elections, proper ones this time! The King said he-\"\n\n\"The King's a little boy tangling with the messes of big men, Adrian.

It'll just be the PNL all over again.\"\n\nThe announcement of new elections has stirred up debate in Romania's public spaces; as people from the highest intellectuals to the peasants in the fields are pondering just what will the future hold and are deciding just what party will be the next one to lead Romania forward. Cynicism still remains strong among certain segments of the populace, who may hold nostalgia for Carol II or for the Captain and his men, but the flourishing of popular dialogue gives many of the more educated citizens hope that democracy may yet take root in Romania."
 romania.229.a: "The ballot boxes will speak soon."
 romania.230.t: "In the Grove"
 romania.230.d: "\"Nea Ilie, Nea Ilie, hurry up, we are ready!\"\n\n\"Hold your horses Gheorghe, I'm coming.\"\n\nIt is a leisurely day in Romania, and with a lull in the day's work, many villagers find it worthwhile to gather up to hear the day's events, be it in a bar or outside in a grove. And in this particular village, the blacksmith's grove is the stage for this communal news discussion.\n\n\"Let's see. Apparently Mihalache wants to easen up peasant financial burdens and promises a debt relief law if his guys make it to Parliament.\"\n\n\"Really, Ilie? This sounds excellent!\"\n\n\"Hey don't hurry him Iorgu, let him read; how'd the Liberals reply?\"\n\n\"Răducanu says they will go for a better one if they take power.\"\n\n\"As if those Brătianu fans will actually do something, right Nea Ilie?\"\n\n\"You better watch it Gheorghe, you know that I like them still, as I know just what a man Ionel Brătianu was.\"\n\n\"Yeah, a puppet of those Germans! He surely stood up for us back then!\"\n\n\"Calm down Barbu, let him get back to reading!\"\n\n\"Oh you sure like to defend him Iorgu, but you wouldn't defend the country in its time of need!\"\n\n\"You didn't take the fall of the Archangel's men lightly didn't you?\"\n\n\"Everyone shut up and let Nea Ilie speak!\" yelled Iocan the blacksmith.\n\nNea Ilie smiled as he watched everyone get along in their own unique way. It was in these heated discussions that opinions grew, exchanges were had but ultimately all was forgiven. For such was the nature of these newspaper chats; just as easily as they could lead to fiery debates, they could lead to the forgiveness of whatever bad blood ensued over a cup of wine or two later on."
 romania.230.a: "Time certainly has its patience, and events like this colour its canvas."
 romania.231.t: "Terrorist Attack in Alföld!"
 romania.231.d: "Despite our best efforts, the western borderlands remain hostile and dangerous for true Romanians. In depressingly common event, group of Magyar terrorists attacked small military patrol deep in Alföld. Our men had hardly answered to the fire when the criminals fled. The patrol was left to tend to their dead and wounded as the hunt for the attackers started, but it was clear for everyone that it would be a fruitless effort. The various separatist organisations of the Alföld region had nearly full support of the locals, and were sheltered and supported by the Hungarian farmers. The only thing we could do is to increase security and keep the cities under increasingly tight grasp."
 romania.231.a: "Send in more troops!"
 romania.231.b: "They will learn to love the whip, in time."
 romania.232.t: "Defiance in Alföld"
 romania.232.d: "In spite of our best attempts to enforce a curfew and curtail resistance activies in Alföld these past few weeks, many woke up this morning to see the Hungarian Flag flown defiantly above several state buildings in Debrecen. It is not known how the perpetrators were able to coordinate such an act of subterfuge, but it is likely they were assisted by sympathetic officials in the local government here. Although they were taken down with haste, the damage was already done. Several outlets had taken photos of the buildings, the news spreading like wildfire in Hungarian newspapers across the border. While nobody was hurt, this act is likely to only embolden the resistance cells here."
 romania.232.a: "Get those blasted flags down, now!"
 romania.233.t: "Officer shot in Alföld"
 romania.233.d: "Residents of Békéscsaba were startled today to hear the sound of several gunshots ring out during the mid day. A masked assailant having shot and killed one of our officers who was drinking at a pub in the city centre. The attempts of the Military Police in the area to pursue after him were thwarted by a rather uncooperative crowd and he was ultimately able to escape. Follow up investigations from witnesses also proved to be unfruitful as many Hungarians outright refused to provide a testimony to the Gendarmerie. It is likely we will never find the perpetrator, having most likely smuggled himself over the Hungarian border, beyond our grasp."
 romania.233.a: "Double the size of the City Garrison. Make sure this never happens again!"
 romania.234.t: "Barracks Looted!"
 romania.234.d: "Reports are coming in that one of our Barracks in Orosháza was looted late last night. A group of rebels were able to attack the base, overpowering the guards stationed there before looting the barracks. All together we lost 17 men once a body count was conducted after the fighters slipped back into the night. Thousands of rifles, hundreds of machine guns and two dozen crates of grenades are now unaccounted for, likely already having been proliferated between several underground cells in the province. If this equipment is allowed to remain out there, it will only lead to more issues in the future for us dealing with the rebels. What should we do?"
 romania.234.a: "Search all the properties in the area. Find those weapons!"
 romania.240.t: "Great Game Cut Short"
 romania.240.d: "Codreanu's revanchist gambit has failed and brought a national catastrophe. Bulgarians have triumphed over us yet again and enforced a humiliating peace treaty. No amount of beaten up 'traitors' could save the situation for the Captain, as the calls for his removal grow louder and louder. Not even his own flock is behind him, as many of his rivals are already smelling blood.\n\nThe King would be rejoicing if he was not stuck in the same accusations as his government is. After all, the war with Bulgaria was one of the few things he agreed on with Codreanu. The liberal opposition, reinvigorated by the total failure of both would-be-dictators, is calling for Carol II's second abdication - this time for ever. Having lost the will to resist these calls, Carol II officially abdicated few days later.\n\nIn the surprise new chance for Romanian democracy, Constantin Brătianu and his National Liberals have once more formed a government with cooperation with young king Mihai I. Together they swear to rebuild the battered Romanian democracy - and if God wills it, build a society without Codreanus and Carol II."

A firm believer in the precepts of the Legion of the Archangel Michael, Cantacuzino made himself remarked in numerous nationalist student congresses, holding fiery speeches denouncing what he saw as blights over his country. Rapidly rising through the Legionary Movement's ranks, becoming a member of the Captain's inner circle and making himself known as a theorist and as an efficient organiser, Cantacuzino became a minister in the Captain's cabinet after their rise to power. Cutting his teeth even more in the Spanish Civil War, the Prince returned home only to become embroiled in the escalating conflict between the Captain and the King.\n\nShocked by the assassination of Codreanu, Cantacuzino joined the fight, rallying many Legionaries to the cause and helping reorganise the movement for the struggle, emerging as a front-runner for the succession of the Captain. Soon enough, the zeal of the Archangel's men won out, and now the barred cross flies true above all of Romania once more. Having asserted himself as worthy of the position, the Legionary Senate has confirmed him as the Captain's successor, and now he stands ready to implement his vision over all of Romania, as its Conducâtor and Regent."

An autocratic charmer par excellence, he used the small-but-rising Legionary Movement as a sledgehammer to further weaken the declining PNL and the Legionaries' old rivals, the National-Christian Defence League. Now however, the scheming King faces one last hurdle in his path towards redeeming his country; the very same Legionary Movement he once supported, and its shadowy Captain, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. As clouds gather on the horizon of the post-Weltkrieg order, both King and Captain foresee opportunities to achieve their goal of national unification and breaking the other's power, and the King, though a flawed man, will act upon any opportunities that come his way to establish himself as his country's uncontested Sun."

Free from the responsibilities associated of the eldest son - albeit some scares like the Lambrino scandal did result in discussions on whether to begin grooming Nicolae for rulership - the younger Prince developed a passion for sports, cars and high-society life. In spite of his mother’s protests, he fell for a woman, Ioana Dumitrescu-Doletti, daughter-in-law to liberal politician Nicolae N. Saveanu, who divorced her then-husband to be by her new beau’s side. Unlike his brother however, Nicolae married his lover outright, violating the Statute of the Royal House and creating a rift between him and his brother; a rift that would lead him to make overtures towards the Legionary Movement.\n\nAfter his brother’s abdication, Nicolae agreed to a deal between him and the ascendant Legionaries where he would take the throne if the Statute of the Royal House was modified accordingly to legitimise his marriage to Ioana. Now, as King, he continues to not show much interest in political affairs, preferring to focus on his own undertakings and hobbies instead."

It may be a heavy burden for his young shoulders, but the King feels that with proper guidance, both he and his country will overcome all adversities and go forward as one."

Though he would like to eventually restore the rule of democracy in his home country and fulfil the dream of his grandfather Ferdinand, the Green Hydra's stranglehold over his country is too formidable at the present date to dislodge. While they haven't moved against him, the greenshirts have learned from their mistakes with King Carol, and now the Archangel's men keep a watchful eye over Mihai's own undertakings. Though he finds relief in his interests of cars and planes, the young King faces a certain fright that if he does anything wrong he'll face the wrath of the Greenshirts, forcing him to at least silently acquiesce to their projects for now. Yet the young King hopes that some day he'll have his chance to finally uproot the Legion from its roost, restore democracy and mend his nation's wounds."

And now, we claim our rights.”\n\n“I request some time to think it over, Your Lordship.”\n\n“You can take as much time as you need but you won’t be able to interrupt this audience. We made sure of it.”\n\nEmotions coursed through the young man’s body as he looked at his predicament. Here he was, surrounded by the green-shirted fanatics, who were now demanding he abandon his throne like a coward! Yet he did not know what to do; he could not call for help and he certainly was not in a rational state of mind. If only his father was still around...\n\n“The Romanians have spoken, your Majesty. It is us who are the true realisation of their will, and trying to resist us only shows just how out of touch you are. Resistance would be futile and would only lead to more strife. What do you choose?”\n\nAgain, Mihai was at a dreadful crossroads. His once-trusty stoic facade was at the precipice of crumbling. He tried biding for time, he tried looking for ways to signal for aid, everything he could, but to no avail. If he was to get out of this alive, he had to sign this damned paper.

I am just giving the nation what it needs.”\n\nAs everyone turned to leave, Cantacuzino lingered.\n\n“I will give you enough time to get your affairs in order. I’ll leave you with that mansion you liked around Săvârşin. As for anything else, we will see.”\n\nThe door closed, and Mihai wept. He felt so weak at that moment, so unlike his father and his predecessors. His country’s future was uncertain, and he felt weak for surrendering it like that. Sure, he had no other choice but in his mind, scenarios were made and dispelled in the blink of an eye, until one moment, where his train of thought stopped on one idea.\n\nThat now, he would truly be free to fly."
 romania.224.b.d: "When King Nicolae was presented with a demand to abdicate, he protested. He had only ever done as the Legion had wanted - even considered himself their ally and benefactor. But none of that helped. While the Captain had been content with allowing German dynasty to rule over the Romanian people, Alexandru Cantacuzino and his supporters would have none of it. Finally they were strong enough to force the king out, and end the humiliating rule of foreign dynasty over their nation."

 ROM_mihail_sturdza_leader_desc: "Born as Prince Mihail Sturdza in 1886 into a prestigious princely family, the newly-crowned $ROM_mihail_sturdza_regnal$ is everything that Carol II was not: experienced, harsh, a true believer in the Legionary cause, and from a centuries-old Romanian family, unlike the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringens. He fought in the Great War, and after it became increasingly drawn towards the Legionary Movement, acting as their spokesman in high diplomatic circles.\n\nHis personal philosophy of governance is that Romania should be run like a barracks - well-organised, militarised, purposeful. Enemies of Romania - the communists and the corrupt - must be tirelessly fought. However, his main interest is in foreign policy. As a career diplomat, King $ROM_mihail_sturdza_regnal$ has a wide network of contacts across Europe, and has even expressed hopes of building an alliance of like-minded states in the Southern and Eastern European region."

 ROM_country_intro_header: "1936년 루마니아 왕국"
 ROM_country_intro_content: "The Kingdom of Romania was still a relatively young country when it joined the Weltkrieg in 1916 with grand ambitions of taking Transylvania from the Hungarians, a dream that remains unrealised to this day. Despite some initial successes in 1916, the small country was quickly overwhelmed by German, Austrian and Bulgarian troops. Against all odds, the Romanian Army did not break and instead established new positions around Iasi. With help of the Russians and the French they rebuilt their strength and repelled the Central Powers again and again. The end only came when the Russian Revolution and collapse of the Eastern Front made Romania's position untenable.\n\nMany young men had died for an ideal that ultimately proved just out of reach, and the situation in the country itself had improved for naught. The Treaty of Bucharest was bitter, even more so because the Romanian army had fought well. With this, the stab-in-the-back narrative emerged - Romania was betrayed by the Russians, they were left alone by the Western Entente, they were sabotaged from the inside by traitorous minorities such as the Jews. Radical movements rose up quickly after, fuelled by bitterness, revanchism and social issues such as unequal land use. By 1936 the strongest of those movements is the Legion of the Archangel Michael, popularly known as the Legionary Movement, led by the young and charismatic Corneliu Codreanu, the Capitan of the Iron Guard.\n\nIn 1927, King Ferdinand passed away and was succeeded by his son, Carol II. Even though Carol had a reputation for being quite the womaniser the war had really left its mark on the king. His dream is clear: to succeed in where his father had failed. In his quest the king found an ally equally driven and struck a deal with Codreanu. Two men united in their revanchist fervour tore apart the democratic system in the 1933 elections. After the assassination of Prime Minister I. G. Duca by the Iron Guard, Codreanu formed the first Legionary government: the first step towards Greater Romania.\n\nWhile the king and the Captain might be allies in their revanchist project, it is clear they ultimately do not wish to share power. The so-called ‘Great Game’ between these two men began quickly after the elections after Codreanu started his ambitious land reform, an issue very popular among his base. Influential landowners appealed to the king, who in turn forced Codreanu to halt his reforms. With the growing enmity between two men the power struggle can only get more fierce, with neither one ready to give up power. As long as they share the common goal of Greater Romania they will work together, but after that... only God knows."
 ROM_country_intro_header_1: "그레이트 게임의 메커니즘"
 ROM_country_intro_content_1: "There is an additional resource used by both Codreanu and the king, Influence. New laws and policies require the approval of both the Legionary-controlled Assembly and the king. This forces both parties to make concessions to drive their own agenda.\n\nAfter choosing to side with Carol or Codreanu, you will unlock a set of decisions to interact with the system from either Codreanu’s or from Carol’s point of view. If you manage to keep the chosen side in power after the Unification, your nation will be stronger than if it changes control.\n\nIn addition to the decisions, §BInfluence§! is gained from the political branch of the focus tree and it is primarily spent on the land reform branch, which requires influence to advance. But beware, your opponent also has their own Influence which gives them more power, enabling many events not necessarily in your advantage."
