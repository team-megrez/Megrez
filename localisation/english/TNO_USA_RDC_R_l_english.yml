His faith encouraged non-violence and he tended to disdain the more conservative politics of America's soldiers. Nevertheless, as part of his eternal quest to soothe his conservative allies within the coalition, today he found himself meeting retired Admiral John McCain Jr, a small, thin man with steely eyes.\n\nThe son of a decorated Admiral, McCain had followed in his father's footsteps, serving in the Pacific Theater as a submarine commander. He had been known as an effective, aggressive commander who pioneered new techniques for submarine warfare that would be crucial in the event of another conflict with the Empire of Japan. While not a politician, conservative hawks recognized in McCain Jr. an ally and kindred spirit. Romney was not so sure until they got onto the topic of family.\n\n\"My son is in the navy as well,\" McCain offered, \"Caused some trouble at the Naval Academy like his old man but he straightened up and his superiors tell me he's a credit to the family name.\" Generations in service to the United States, Romney reflected, a family putting itself at risk for the Republic. A swell of admiration rose within him.\n\n\"Would you mind explaining a few more points about our naval positioning within the Pacific, Admiral?\" He asked, \"It seems to leave us vulnerable in a few places...\" His eyes blazing with interest, McCain leapt into a detailed analysis of the United States' position in the Pacific without any notes or preparation. Impressed, Romney was content to sit back and listen. Their meeting concluded, the Admiral prepared to leave but the President had one final question for the old sea-dog."

In George's opinion, America had been built on the back of volunteerism and private organizations. In the modern age, rather than double down on a centralized federal approach to solving America's problems, Romney wanted to try something new based on older principles. A collaboration between nonprofits, volunteer groups and corporate giving programs could have extremely positive far-reaching effects if the right person were in charge.\n\n\"Absolutely, Mr. President, \"Cornuelle replied, \"Granted, I think you're more of an expert on the concept of the Independent Sector, but I'll be the best salesman for the concept that I can be.\"\n\n\"Maybe I do know more about it, for now, than you, Rich, maybe I don't. And I'd love to give it my full attention, but the demands of this office prevent me. A good President, or manager, needs to know when to delegate. I don't need a salesman for this, I need a leader.\"\n\n\"You make a good point there, Mr. President,\" The ex-libertarian answered, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, \"I appreciate the focus on problem-solving rather than just repeating stale dogma, and I do think this will do a lot of good for people who need help.

Getting corporations to buy in had been seen as one of the program's major stumbling blocks, but with the participation of a few, and success, more would be sure to follow.\n\n\"That's excellent news, Richard,\" The President responded, moving to the next step of the program, \"Did you have any thoughts about how to encourage more volunteering by citizens? Rates have been stagnant for some time now...\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Cornuelle said, producing a list from his pocket, \"The corporate representatives suggested a program where volunteering a certain number of hours leads to paid holidays. There is also the option to publicize the program as much as possible and get America interested.\"\n\n\"Both good ideas,\" Romney responded, \"But there must be a way to get high-earners, movers and shakers in communities invested. Maybe some sort of tax credit or deduction for volunteering work or organization?\"\n\nCornuelle nodded, his pen a blur as he noted the idea and began spinning new proposals off it. The office was a blur of activity and conversation as the two men hammered out a few proposals for the Independent Sector before other matters demanded the President's attention."

We've tried governmental alleviation of social problems and, while some gains have been made, other wounds have only deepened with nothing to show for it but spent money. I think a new approach, as you described, could help a great number of Americans trapped in the pit.\"\n\n\"To the specifics then, George,\" Cornuelle said with a wry grin, \"Corporate giving programs, as well as making every effort to encourage volunteering and social engagement are natural first steps. But the establishment of the Independent Sector, to bring non-profits, businesses and community leaders under one collaborative roof should be our highest priority.\"\n\nThe two spoke for about an hour more as Cornuelle laid out his plans.

I want legislation moving through Congress to break through the resistance we're still facing in some quarters.\" Heads were nodding and Humphrey took the opportunity to speak up.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of appetite among more liberal quarters of the Senate for more action on civil rights. We can talk about desegregation efforts and enforcement, further antidiscrimination statutes—\"\n\n\"What about bussing?\" Romney broke in, provoking glances between the audience of senators, \"We can desegregate today, it's just a matter of administration and transportation. If we want to set a moral, and efficient, example I think that's the best path forward.\"\n\nEveryone in the room knew that bussing was politically risky, with parents opposing their children being sent to different schools often on the other side of the city from their home, in addition to racist opposition to school integration.

Schools' funding was uneven, depending on aid from the state and the property taxes of the surrounding community, leaving richer districts far better off than poor ones. That gap would have to be bridged if any kind of improvement in education was to be made.\n\nThe federal government would pick up the tab, the President and his cabinet decided. Uncle Sam's munificence would brighten the lives and education of innumerable children across the country. In order to track the program's success and make sure money was being spent properly, federal testing and curriculum standards would follow the new federal funds.\n\nThis new policy would be a political winner. Parents and teachers would both appreciate the new funds and resources even if children and the unions grumbled about the new testing and standards.

A pound can be worth as much as a dime one day, half that the month following, and close to a dollar two months later. Movements so drastic turn even the most profitable deals into break-even disappointments; with the razor thin margins international transactions live by, is it really any wonder businesses have grown so sluggishly as of late?\n\nThe Treasury suggests tethering the Free World's currencies to the stolid dollar in response. From now until negotiated otherwise, a pound will go for exactly a certain number of dollars, and not a cent more or less. Knowing that such an equivalence won't budge overmuch for long periods of time will help businesses plan around long-distance, long-term contracts while still feeling confident in expecting returns, in turn encouraging trade across our bloc.

High tariffs preserved the American character of our markets for over a century since. Such policies have doubtless enriched Americans, made America richest besides... but will they enrich the Free World with her? Have they?\n\nCommerce Secretary Fowler emphatically said no. In fact high tariffs, he continued, render our allies into little more than impoverished dependents for American goods, with no means of selling their own. The solution, then, is to willingly curtail the advantages which cement our own goods' predominance, allowing the rest of the Free World to profit off us in turn.\n\nNeedless to say, his proposal has few friends both in Congress and among the public, least of all among the workers whose produce he intends to disadvantage.

Capital and goodwill wasted on exchanging old allies for new and controversial stances is capital and goodwill not spent on curtailing America's rampant inflation, or on containing fascism's metastasis in the world's last unblemished patches.\n\nBut neither can he afford to be seen by the public as ignoring the issue wholesale. With this in mind, he turns to the Congressman's second truest friend next to the filibuster: Red tape. If you want the right thing done after trying everything else, to modify a saying..."

 USA_wfb_64_leave_door_open_desc: "While we have taken a more conservative path on the issue of civil rights than the activists might like, there is no reason why we cannot have more change in the future. As President Bennett has insisted in the past, real change does not happen overnight. Though the government needs to get on to other things, we can keep the discussion going, and encourage those who believe in the cause of civil rights to direct their efforts towards future reforms. This way, we can keep the civil rights movement reasonably content and also prevent the segregationists from feeling alienated."

We have already devoted far too much time to the issue, and it is time we get on to other more pressing matters of government. The civil rights movement will probably be somewhat upset, but they should at least acknowledge that they are in a better position than they were before. Putting our foot down should also reassure the Dixiecrats that we aren't abandoning them or our own values."

We have the chance to present ourselves as the new face of the status quo, and finally restore our party to dominance in the American political theatre. We will always be grateful to our Democrat partners for ensuring our survival these past two decades, of course. But now it is time for us to return to our place in the sun."

This ambiguity has left both segregationists and civil rights activists uncertain of where exactly they stand. Now that we have put the foot down on any further legislation, we should focus our efforts on clarifying the laws that already exist, ensuring all terms are clearly defined and that there is no more room for 'creative interpretations'. All Americans must be able to clearly understand the laws they live under."

While many may clamor for true progress, it is in the interests of all that the stability of the nation be considered first and foremost. The fires of progress must be kept controlled by the guiding hand of tradition, lest the fire set our society aflame. To the good people of the civil rights movement; we know you are not satisfied, but you must be patient, for our society is not quite ready to accept your view just yet. Your time will come, but for the time being, we must keep America steady as she goes."

While it is unlikely we could convince the most staunch racists of the error of their ways, we could still change the minds of some of the more moderate people. We should encourage the civil rights supporters, especially the African Americans themselves, to speak up about their experiences and how segregation has affected them.

 USA_wfb_64_fine_line_desc: "Our careful balance of both liberal and conservative values has earned us at least muted approval from both sides of the spectrum. True to his word, President Bennett has gone to great lengths to bring all of America under one banner, favoring neither side above the other, while ensuring everyone walks away reasonably happy. Nobody can say they got everything they wanted, but that is the nature of compromise. With our government policy taking a reasonable middle ground, it is highly likely that for the most part, the status quo will be maintained within the halls of power."

Under significant pressure by Senate majority leader Lyndon Johnson and liberals within the RDC, the 39th President of the United States has announced his intention to sign a civil rights bill if passed by Congress."

As President Bennett proves, a consideration of the values of both parties is actually far more beneficial to our nation than simply considering each set of values in isolation. Besides, we've made broad-spectrum politics work far better than the NPP and their constant bickering amongst themselves. In all, the Bennett presidency has made the bond between the Republicans and Democrats stronger than ever; even if we have our ups and downs with each other, we have shown we can work together for the betterment of all."
 USA_wfb_64_through_fellowship_unity: "동료애를 통한 단결"
 USA_wfb_64_through_fellowship_unity_desc: "The one thing President Bennett has not compromised on is his willingness to compromise. Never once doubting that meaningful change can be achieved while still respecting those who value tradition, he has ensured that all aspects of our society are represented, proving himself the true master of compromise. There is always more room for changes and alterations in the future, but with all parties reasonably satisfied, we can save those future discussions for another day. Segregationists, civil rights activists, people and politicians - we are all Americans, and now we can step forwards to face the issues of the day together."

With over three decades in Congress and nearly a decade as the majority leader of the greatest deliberative body, Johnson is no stranger to political fights.\n\nWhile Westerners could be bought off with dams and water projects, the Plains with subsidies and block grants, Johnson knows there is no swaying the South on the issue of Segregation. Neither pork nor influence nor bribery will sway the men of Southland to come around on Civil Rights, and Johnson won't even bother.\n\nAnd he'll make sure the Republicans know that too."

 USA_wfb_64_voting_rights_act_desc: "Lyndon B. Johnson, senate leader for the Democrats, has taken the floor with the support of various figures from his party faction to propose a Voting Rights Act. This act would go a step further than the protections we have implemented thus far, and guarantee the political and voting rights of African Americans and other minorities on the federal level. With progressive values beginning to win out across both the Republicans and the Democrats, it would make little sense to oppose this new bill, which would cement our support with the civil rights movement. However, many within our party fear this would be seen as a grave transgression by the segregationists, and that we will likely lose a lot of support in the south for allowing this to go through."

Nary a year ago streets all across our nation echoed with the yells of progressives and segregationists crying fury in each other's faces, seeing each other not as fellow Americans but as enemies. The issue threatened to tear apart the very fabric of America. Now, the streets are mostly quiet. Those once bellicose protesters and furious statesmen have either celebrated the dawn of a new day, or accepted that the world has moved past their squabbles.

Any further legislation on the matter can be handled in a calm, rational manner over time, as our great political system always allowed for. With the main source of consternation in our nation quelled, we can finally present ourselves as a strong, united force against all the darkness of the world. Unlike in Japan or Germany, we Americans handle our issues with dignity, lawfulness and common ground, not jackboots and suppression.

President Bennett was not one for violence -- but he does believe that the torch of human freedom must likewise be fed with kindling and tinder. The intensity of its flames proportions itself accordingly to the quality of its tendered fuel; stronger commitments to like-minded causes create brighter, more beautiful flames.\n\nEight years of hindsight has led the President to appreciate how far it has grown: Once sputtered licks of ember after Watergate, now a blazing inferno after the many reforms of his two terms. At home, the American people now exercise their freedoms under a safe and stable system managed by capable men. Abroad, America's own league of free nations grow by leaps and bounds, bringing life and vigor to ideals besieged by fascist empires..."

But the weary Utahn allowed himself some satisfaction for making the most out of his Presidency, and thus in bringing about the feats his country can achieve at its greatest.\n\nWallace F. Bennett let out a chuckle as he leaned back against the most prestigious office chair in Washington, D.C. His feet laid atop the Resolute Desk, legs now free to shuffle about a desk void of drafts and memos for the first time in eight years. America can fight its causes without him... but with him, he can deservedly say, it has gained the disposition and the means to fight on for many decades yet.\n\nNot bad for a Mormon office clerk, all things considered."

But with all that said, Muskie has a lot going for him. If Treasury Secretary Robertson is a reward to President Bennett's conservative backers, Secretary of State Muskie is an olive branch to the liberal wing of the Republican-Democrats. As Maine's governor, and, subsequently, senator, he's championed civil rights and environmental protections, bringing Maine fully into the 20th century. Depending on who you ask, he's either the right man to represent America on the world stage, or a lily-livered provincial who's better off sending pork back to Portland.

His appointment is surely a sop to President Bennett's supporters in Congress. But it also has many in the opposition worried. The Treasury Department has a great deal of power over taxes and audits.

Fewer rigid doctrines, and more counterinsurgency. To his supporters in Congress, McNamara is a man who will shake things up, rationalizing the business of war in a new era of conflict.

His bureaucrat guides then showed off the vast quantities of ink, paper, and machinery that, when combined, created one of the world's most important currencies. One of the guides brought out a new five-dollar bill, and offered it to Robertson. He obligingly held it up for the UPI cameraman, smiling as the paper Abe Lincoln grimaced."

This act is merely part of a larger initiative on the part of President Bennett to abandon a metallic standard altogether, to be replaced with a fiat currency backed only by the word of the Treasury Department.\n\nMore a removal of past legislation than anything, the act includes multiple provisions geared toward a decrease in silver backing. The most major among these directives is the repeal of the 1934 Silver Purchase Act, which effectively subsidized and encouraged silver mining to unnatural levels. The act also allowed for the production of $1 and $2 Federal Reserve notes to keep up with a changing economy.\n\nLawmakers hope the act will prove successful. The repeal of the Silver Purchase Act will prevent rampant overspending on silver by the Treasury, and hopefully increase fiscal responsibility in general. Concerns over the passage have been minimal, and many are greatly relieved by the move toward a more simplified and robust currency."

President Bennett had found himself pondering this very question a multitude of times past, and his advisors comforted him with what may just be the most optimum solution; the Forum on OFN Diplomacy.\n\nThe Forum on OFN Diplomacy, as it is called, will be established as a vehicle to organise and deliberate on a combined foreign policy for all the nations of the OFN-no matter their size, the wealth of their lands or the strength of their soldiers. This would allow the OFN to act more efficiently in response to global incidents or to cooperate in the face of a looming threat that seeks to undermine the precious sovereignty of one of its members.\n\nThe bill's arrival at the conference floor has thus far been greeted with a warm embrace rather than cries, with the delegates seeming to, at the very least, sympathise with the ideals of the proposal-even if there are some who baselessly mumble to themselves that the Forum could prove a disastrous and unjust loss of their control over their own diplomatic dealings. President Bennett is rather hopeful of the coming vote himself."

 WFB.79.t: "새로운 지평으로"
 WFB.79.desc: "The passing of the vote on the proposed Forum on OFN diplomacy is marked by the conference hall erupting into cheers.\n\nNo longer will the OFN depend on an incoherent, inconsistent and disunited mess of a foreign policy, nor will it be a concealed arm of American dominance, acting as a way to project their own policy goals on their spherelings. Instead, the Forum on OFN Diplomacy will function as a democratic and pluralist institution that investigates the worries and threats to its member states before deliberating on a unified diplomatic response to the said issues. The Forum will be based on egalitarian principles and will turn into a hand of tyranny that subverts the needs of lesser states in favour of bigger players, quite the opposite, the Forum will be a place where all members of the OFN will dance harmonically together to the symphony of liberty.\n\nTo the relief of many, the Forum has alleviated many worries that were strung up by the advent of the quagmire that was known as the South African War, and will help keep all those who partake in it on the same page towards the matter of foreign intervention and civil conflict.\n\nAll over the Free World, people can finally sleep soundly at night knowing that they have the combined diplomatic might of the OFN on guard duty and ready to protect them at a moment's notice. One can only rejoice at this development."

 WFB.80.t: "또 다른 버려진 꿈"
 WFB.80.desc: "President Bennett sat accompanied by Marriner S Eccles, whose brainchild the Forum on OFN Diplomacy was, both visibly distraught and brought down by the disaster that had struck a myriad of hours before.\n\nThe Forum was genius, the masterstroke of decades of OFN diplomatic procedure, yet it all burnt down in that conference's voting hall before it could all begin. One could not even begin to understand how this could have happened; was there a miscounting of votes? Did some of the elements who were dismayed by the proposal somehow manage to defraud it? How could any of our children ever forgive us for this catastrophic mishap? One that could prove to even have apocalyptical consequences?\n\nBennett brushed those conspiratorial and quite obviously ridiculous theories off his brain, yet he still found it incredibly challenging to stop himself from preventing the onslaught of curses that the foolish and bizarre actions of the delegates had struck into him, despite his Christian own dismay at such profanities.\n\nTo the cheers of Germania and Tokyo, and the cries of any freedom-loving citizen of the constituencies of the OFN, the OFN was now disunited and bickering in the face of its imperialist and fascist adversaries. Our hopes of a united front have been strangled in the cradle, and those crushed under Germany's Iron boot and suffocated under the weight of the rising Japanese sun, will look at us with contempt and scorn us for the day we have failed them; the day they awaited the coming liberation we promised so long ago."

 WFB.81.t: "금만큼 좋은가?"
 WFB.81.desc: "Bennett studied the various economic reports and information about the proposed monetary system for the OFN on his hotel desk. It was an unprecedented proposal that would set fixed exchange rates within the OFN, and to say it was controversial was an understatement. When he introduced the proposal earlier that day to the OFN, it caused an uproar amongst the representatives of each member state.\n\nHe sighed, and picked up the telephone on the desk. \"Hello, operator? Could you connect me to Room 110? Thank you.\"\n\nThe line buzzed for a brief moment until his call was connected to Henry Fowler. \"Yes, sir? What is it?\"\n\n\"This whole monetary system thing... Do you really think it could pass? If our dollar suffers, so does everyone else's, but if it grows then so does the rest of the OFN's economy. It just seems like such a radical and risky gamble for economic growth.\"\n\nThe line went silent for what felt like an eternity to Wallace, before being broken by some grumblings. \"Well, uh, sir. It certainly is risky and a gamble, but I believe it is one that is worth it. If we're going to bring each other closer against the Japs and Germans, then we ought to make it so that if we win, so does everyone else. No man left behind, and I certainly hope the rest of the OFN sees that.\"\n\nBennett sighed and rubbed his face. It's going to take a hell of a lot of convincing to get the rest of the OFN to see things the way Fowler does. \"I hope so too, Henry. I understand their concern about this whole thing, but this potentially means a lot of good things for our economy. Not only as a nation, but as an alliance. I just wish they'd see it that way.\"\n\n\"Then we should give them a piece of our minds later, and get this through. I'll prepare some more reports and analyses regarding this, I'm sure it'll make them see things our way.\" Fowler confidently quipped. Bennett thought he sounded too arrogant, but he felt convinced with Fowler's promises.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to it, Henry.\" Bennett replied, hanging up the phone. Those reports better change the OFN's mind."

 WFB.82.desc: "The OFN Monetary System was passed. For the first time in history, America and its partners would have fixed exchange rates. So why wasn't Bennett as pleased as he expected?\n\nCertainly, Bennett had just done a lot of good for the OFN. This bill would essentially eliminate the possibility of some insipid currency war from breaking out among the equal parties of the OFN. For the average American - for the average citizen of the OFN, really, trade would be easier - no more fears about sudden depreciation wiping their investments away. This would bring the OFN one step closer to an efficient, integrated market.\n\nBut... it wasn't perfect. Of all the bills that Bennett had put in front of the OFN's high command, this was the first to give him a moment of pause. America's currency now guided an entire continent. If America used its monetary system to its greatest extent - say if some great crisis required it to lower its interest rates - it could cause a cascading harm to every member of the OFN. Even more so than usual, American money would be static. And if it ever failed to be that static, it could crash this entire system to the ground.\n\nRegardless, it was a good sign for his own authority at least. The rest of the OFN was committing to something of a trust fall, allowing themselves to feel protected in the arms of the Federal Reserve. That meant something was working. Even if this tower might someday fall down, he'd certainly have the time to build it up."

For an hour or so, Bennett had been held up in his office, flipping through the papers his secretary had sent over. It wasn't seething, or stewing. Contemplating, that was the word for it. He was contemplating his next move.\n\nThe jargon was as complex as always, but the news was simple: the OFN Monetary System had failed. In all honesty, it wasn't the greatest surprise. The plan he had imagined necessitated a deep trust in the American monetary system, as well as with the representative currency to which Bennett had defined his career. This plan was a radical step for the OFN, and clearly, his partners did not feel comfortable making it with him.\n\nThere'd be tomorrow, Bennett reminded himself. Another day for another plan. If Bennett had found himself with a lack of trust among his fellow members of the OFN, that could easily change in time, as their internal politics changed or as other reforms proved successful. There would be time to build up the OFN, make certain it was ready and able to accept future reforms.\n\nStill, it never felt fantastic to see a project of yours rejected. But what else was there to do but continue? Tomorrow, he'd be back in his office, draft up something new, and work from there. Today, and only today, Bennett would mourn an idea that never got off the ground."

 WFB.84.desc: "In the Senate, Bennett mused, he had always thought of Tariff Reform as a White Whale whenever it was brought up in the Finance Committee. A magic bullet to American trade woes. Now here he was, having been sold on it, or more accurately, being harangued on it, by his gaggle of advisors.\n\nFowler, Roberston, Muskie, and just about every free-trade advocate in Congress had come into his office, argued, or lectured, with him on the specifics and then left. Nevermind the fact that the Unions, the bald, scowling eminence of George Meany, and Walt Reuther's smug smiling mug were already lining up attack ads and pamphlets. Ready to inform every Union household on just how their Congressman had voted to send their jobs overseas.\n\n\"Mr. President?\"\n\n\"Yes, son?\"\n\n\"The delegates are ready for you, sir.\"\n\n\"Let them know I'll be right there,\" Bennett motioned, looking over the draft of his speech once more. He'd be extolling the virtues of free trade, reduced tariffs and silently thanking the lord he'd be retiring once he left the White House."

To his surprise, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade had passed with the OFN after much political wrangling on his part. Fowler's wild promises had convinced him and the rest of the OFN to go through with it.\n\nHe stopped pacing at the center of his room, and looked around. It was a nice room he thought, his eyes moving to the television that was provided for him. He picked up the remote and sat on his bed, browsing through the various nightly news channels.\n\n\"Moving on to other news: the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been passed in a surprising turn of events. Here, we have economist John Aznable for comment.\"\n\n\"Thank you Walt, well I certainly think that this is a good m-\"\n\n\"Worker strikes over the passing of the GATT have already broken out in the Steel Belt, while members of the NP-\"\n\n\"Hubert Humphrey and other high profile members of the NPP have condemned the Agreem-\"\n\nBennett turned off the TV, took off his glasses and sighed. Was it really the best thing to do? Even though he got the rest of the OFN to agree with it, he still felt as if it was a mistake. Maybe Fowler was wrong, his promises too good to be true? But would Fowler have pushed for it in the first place if he wasn't absolutely sure it would be beneficial to the OFN and bring it together even more? Bennett wasn't sure, but he was too tired to think anymore.\n\nHe laid down on his bed and pulled over the blankets. A good night's sleep should make up his mind."

Come in.\" A jaded voice replied.\n\nBennett entered the hotel room of Henry Fowler, the sound of news channels being changed and TV static filled the room as he closed the door.\n\n\"Keeping up with the news of the Bretton Woods Conference, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been rejected by-\"\n\n\"Union celebrations in the Steel Belt over the rejection of the GA-\"\n\n\"In my opinion, President Bennett should have strong-armed the-\"\n\n\"Why did he let the GATT be rejected?

It could have made us even stronger against the Pakt and Japs.\"\n\nBennett took a seat and looked at Fowler. \"Look, we have to face it, Henry. There was no way they would accept it. It was too radical, and even I didn't like it. I don't think the promises you made could have been achieved, it would have just left us all disappointed.\"\n\nFowler sneered and stood up from his bed. \"I don't make empty promises, Wallace. The GATT would have been exactly what I said it would be. Yes it's radical and yes, it would have hurt us in the short term, but it would have brought the OFN closer than it ever could be. We should have bit the bullet now, and enjoy the long-term prosperity it would have brought us.\"\n\nBennett stood up and walked towards the door, turning around before opening it. \"We're supposed to keep a steady and stable ship, not a radical change of course. Who knows what the GATT would have actually brought, but I don't think it would have brought anything good. Now, have a good night and get some rest for tomorrow. That's all.\"\n\nBennett opened the door and left before Fowler could respond, but he felt as if there was nothing he could say to change the President's mind."
 WFB.86.a: "A true what-if."
 WFB.87.t: "On Papers and Trade"
 WFB.87.desc: "Bennett glanced at the opinion piece. He had the New York Times delivered to Oval Office every week, its editorials and opinions usually critical, and the latest issue was no exception. \"Lack of Trade Reform Threatens OFN Unity.\"\n\nIt was ironic, truly, one of the few issues where he had found common ground with George Meany and Walter Reuther was being used as a cudgel. Men who he'd otherwise have very little in common. Bennett's rejection of the Trade Expansion Act introduced in the house symbolized, depending on who you asked, the Administration's dangerous isolationist leanings, its hidebound conservative tendencies, or proof of its association with corrupt unions.\n\nBennett checked his watch, resisting coffee's temptation before his 6 o'clock meeting, lest further rumour of that leak out to Utah. Oh sure, Robertson and Fowler had tried their damndest to sway to their views. Of increased growth and further prosperity from American goods, and they did nearly convince him, but his principles had trumped his pragmatism.\n\nForeign goods could still come to American shores, of course, but not at the cost to the worker, or farmer, or rancher. Now that had got him the first good press in the Steel Belt he'd had in months.\n\nThe Steel Belt. That reminded him. George Romney was going to be running for something, or other soon enough once tenure as Governor ran out, and Bob couldn't exactly work at the White House. George was a friend, perhaps something could be worked out. Bennett glanced at the editorial again, and threw it in waste paper basket."

 WFB.88.t: "Weathering with the OFN"
 WFB.88.desc: "Bennett entered the conference room with his cabinet, the once bustling and cramped room now empty for themselves as most of the OFN representatives had gone home. He took his seat, as did the members of his cabinet.\n\n\"Alright. That was an exhausting week but I'm glad we got it done. What do you all think of the things we've achieved?\"\n\nDefense Secretary Clark Clifford snapped before the rest of the cabinet could speak. \"Well sir, I think we did a fantastic job of getting the OFN closer together than it already is. If we continue on this steady course and not rock the boat too much, so to speak, then I can easily see us being able to further develop our joint military capabilities and the military-industrial complex to counter the Pakt and the Sphere.\"\n\nThe cabinet chuckled, but Bennett found himself irritated at the boat comment. \"That's certainly true, Cliff. This should act as a way for us to be able to develop the alliance further. Is that all?\"\n\n\"I think it'll also-\" Clifford's reply was cut off by Vice President Gerald Ford. \"It's all great, sir. This whole thing only benefits us, the OFN and the broader world. While we've got some grumbling from the unions and the progressives, I think we should be able to convince them of its benefits. It's up to us to implement what we've agreed on as a community.\" Ford remarked, sneering at Clifford.\n\nForeign Secretary Edmund Muskie interjected, gesturing at a map of the OFN and the rest of the world. \"Now, if I may, sir, Clifford's right, this'll enable us to further develop our relations with the rest of OFN as we now come closer as a community of nations. It'll also present other nations with a much more appealing bloc to align themselves with, a bulwark against the Germans and Japs.\"\n\nBennett paused to think. They're all right. While they might not have gotten all of what they wanted from the conference, it certainly brought them closer and promoted cooperation amongst nations. Politics aside, he wondered about the economics of it all.\n\n\"So, uh, Robertson. Your thoughts?\"\n\n\"I agree with them all, sir. This will bring us closer as an alliance. Though I don't personally agree with some of the things we've agreed upon, I think it should be just fine in the end.\""

The sky is gray, having let loose an anemic inch's worth of snow over Washington D.C. last night. It looks lovely on the trees, perhaps, but everyone can see the grimy slush on the ground. For all of Bennett's rhetoric, protesters rally for segregation in Birmingham, and for liberation in Little Rock. Against all of this, what can new monetary policy and \"sensible\" civil rights efforts do? The early 1960s brought disenchantment on unprecedented levels.

They are notoriously stubborn, and now that particular characteristic is shining through. Several Dixiecrat senators have threatened to filibuster the upcoming bill pushed by the Bennett administration, egged on by Strom Thurmond, NPP senator from South Carolina, generally considered to be the current head of the Southern Caucus.

These tests were disproportionately given to African American voters, and had an astronomical failure rate.\n\nConsequently, an official investigation into Southern voting stations and practices, as well as into what voter verification measures are and are not permitted, is beginning to take shape.

As things stand currently, Bennett's Civil Rights bill would be narrowly defeated in Congress.\n\nConsequently, both the RDC House and Senate whips have been working round the clock to bribe, bully, blackmail, or otherwise coerce the more conservative elements of the party into voting for Bennett's bill. This situation is particularly worrying, as it is becoming more and more apparent that some compromises may need to be made with the Dixiecrats if any Civil Rights legislation is to be passed."

Influential figures in the party, such as Michael Harrington, found the bill fell short of true social equality, and believed that, were it passed, there would be no more political will for further Civil Rights legislation. On the opposite end of the spectrum, many fence-sitting, old-fashioned Democrats feared that the bill was perhaps too ambitious. Balancing these two groups proved to be an immense challenge; the bill would not pass without their support. Despite some setbacks, the President and Senator Lyndon Johnson were able to convince them to throw their lot in with the bill.\n\nNo official announcement regarding the alliance has been made, and likely never will. Word spreads fast of changing loyalties, however, and the lips of politics are the loosest in existence. No doubt Strom Thurmond and his Dixiecrat caucus already know of the success of Bennett's gamble, and it no doubt terrifies them."

 WFB.114.desc: "Today, in a surprising announcement, President Bennett's liberal Civil Rights bill has been passed, with possibly the most significant legal protection for non-whites since the passing of the 15th Amendment in 1870. It includes comprehensive protections for voting rights, forbidding state-mandated \"literacy tests\" targeted at African Americans. It also includes timetables for the total desegregation of American society, demanding that all Jim Crow laws and other race-based legislation be repealed within four months. Most importantly, however, it forbids the discrimination of employment on race, color, religion, or national origin.\n\nMany are surprised that such an all-encompassing, liberal Civil Rights bill was even passed in the first place. In the weeks leading up to the voting on the bill, there was quite a scramble in the RDC, as President Bennett and his allies struggled to gather the votes. In the end, however, it appears the President was able to get the bill passed, with no compromises on the rights and freedoms of minorities."

The bill, while less comprehensive than some might have hoped, is still one of the largest steps towards total equality between Americans since the passing of the 15th Amendment in 1870. The bill includes federal protections for voting rights, prohibiting \"literacy tests\" and other such fraudulent measures at the state level intended to disenfranchise minorities from voting. It also includes the prohibition of discriminatory employment based on race, color, religion, etc.\n\nMany more liberal-minded citizens are dissatisfied with how the bill has turned out, however. The bill was originally much more liberal and comprehensive, with far greater protection of the rights of minorities. Due to the need to compromise with Conservative politicians in Washington, several of these protections were loosened or simply removed entirely. Despite this, the majority of people across the nation are simply pleased that any Civil Rights legislation was passed at all."

All provisions for voting protection against minority disenfranchisement have been removed, and only moderate prohibition of discriminatory employment practices. In addition, greatly encompassing exceptions have been added to the bill, dictating that in certain circumstances, minority protections need not be enforced.\n\nOverall, the bill has drawn a vast amount of criticism from the more liberal-minded politicians in Washington, with many deeming it ineffectual.

Three combat veterans, three Southern Democratic Senators, three figures in the Silver Act vote. \"Good morning, gentlemen.\" He said. \"Let's face the light here: the Silver Act's vote is creeping up, but the Congress remains polarized, and I fear the worst; so, I'm sending you three down to the Serpent of the South himself, George C. Wallace to guarantee the extra votes. Understood?\"\n\nAnd there we were. The room was silent. The three of us were silent. The Governor of Alabama just sat there, quiet, the whole fucking building was just quiet. \"Senators, may I ask what you three are doing down here in my office?\" he said, as the pouring of whiskey into five separate glasses flowed in front of us. One Senator picked up first, coughing, \"Well, sir, the President sent us here to-\" \"Oh, my apologies, gentlemen, please, the travel must have dried your throats; please, enjoy a drink.\" He interrupted. \"Don't worry, Mr. Governor, I do not drink.\" I said, shooting me with eyes like daggers. \"Now, as I was saying, sir, President Bennett sent us here to discuss the proceedings of the Silver Act coming up, and how we can align our interests for the betterment of the nation.\" the Senator said. Wallace swiveled his chair to face the man, stating, \"Align our interests? Funny little phrase you put together there. Now, what could the President offer that I may want?\" The air in the room tightened like a noose around a criminal's throat. \"Well, segregation, sir.\" the younger Senator with the Southern drawl voiced.\n\nWallace turned. \"So, Bennett's finally ready to ease down on protecting the Afros? Well, you have my attention, gentlemen. Go on.\" the Governor asked with a wicked smirk and unending stare. \"Well,\" I finally spoke up, \"the President would be glad to have your support, as well as the Nationalists' support of the terms of the Silver Act. In exchange, he'll look into delaying the work towards Civil Rights legislation.\" The room stood silent, and still as Wallace's face twisted with contemplation. Suddenly, the room exploded with the slamming of the Governor's fist onto the desk, succeeded by a fierce cackling. \"Well, gentlemen, you can go tell Bennett that Governor Wallace shall be considering his proposal to rectify relations with the NPP and the Republicans. For now, however.\" He stopped short, clearing his throat. \"A toast, to the people of the United States.\" I shakily led our side of the toast and downed the liquor before leaving."

With low interest rates, adjusted oversight, and more provisions, a lucrative section of the finance industry has just exploded. New applicants fresh out of college walk through the office doors seemingly every day. And on the other line of their phones and meeting with people who want to invest, business confidence is being revitalized.\n\nDevin hangs up. He never thought after barely getting his degree, he'd be working in a practically brand new industry. He resigned to a middle management position, but was now making his own money and helping other Americans make it too. To his side, a new arrival sits down, carrying a cardboard box of belongings.\n\n\"Hey.\" The two men exchange an awkward handshake. \"You've been here a while, right?\" Devin nods.

They drill our military, they send our boys to die in South Africa, they have massive investment into our economy as investors and trading partners, and our diplomats are forced to play second fiddle to American ones. Michael knows that all too well, being a part of Australia's diplomatic corps. Perhaps, deep down, he was only worried about his 1st son, Gil. If those Yanks send him to die somewhere else, he wouldn't know what to do.\n\nThat is, until the American Ambassador paid a visit to Canberra today. And with him, he brought some very interesting news.\n\n\"President Bennett has readjusted his policy dealing with members of the OFN. As of today, we'll be withdrawing some of our own administration and diplomatic staff, and giving more autonomy to the Australian government in terms of who and what they want to proceed with diplomatically.\"\n\nMichael couldn't believe his ears. After the speech from the ambassador, he turned to the man next to him. \"Hey, mate. You really believe what this Yank is saying? They've been up our arse for decades at this point.\"\n\nThe man nodded. \"That Bennett really is doing his best to equalize OFN policy. I may not like the Yanks either, but they're doing their best to finally even the scales. About bloody time, if you ask me.\"\n\nMichael had a sigh of relief internally. Years of worry, and reform is finally upon us. Even if he still had doubts, the new Administration in Washington was at least trying to not be the hegemon in which the OFN relies on. Much like before, Michael knew with confidence now that his opinion was shared with many Australians."

In order to ensure that the foreign policy across the OFN is consistent, we will decide exactly what the OFN is- not the sphere of influence of America, but a proper bloc against the fascist forces of the world.\n\nIn order to ensure that all within the OFN are taken into account, we will rework our own foreign policy, in order to ensure that even the least noteworthy members of the OFN can properly make an impact on world affairs. As well, to ensure that our nations closely coordinate, we will host a yearly meeting of all members of the OFN to discuss the situation in the world, and how to deal with these challenges.§!"
 USA_WFB_CFN_reform_3_tt: "§WIMF and the World Bank§!\n\n§FThe International Monetary Fund has been a subject of heated debate until recent years, thanks to the efforts of President Bennett to ensure pan-national economic stability, and not just within the realm of the OFN. Through establishing a fund for nations across the world to contribute towards, the IMF system would establish a financial pool of resources, which would be used to create string attached loans and provide partial economic stability to a country facing a financial crisis.\n\nWhile this system may initially seem to be a way to lend aid to nations that may be susceptible to the whims of the OFN -which it partially is- the system is also capable of pressuring other nations that would profit from this system to begin adopting capitalism like they never have before and to begin prioritizing fiscal discipline over economic growth. This will only benefit America, the OFN, and the world as a whole.§!"
 USA_WFB_CFN_reform_4_tt: "§WFixed Exchange Rates§!\n\n§FThe notion of mending the currencies of the OFN to that of America has been one familiar to the countless avid supporters and fierce opposition to the proposed system of the OFN Monetary System. Consisting of using the various central banks of the OFN nations in question to balance the currencies, this system has gained plenty of support thanks to President Bennett stabilizing the American dollar. By linking the currencies of the OFN to the now stable dollar, we should be able to maintain some modicum of stability and prevent massive fluctuations in the value of other currencies within the OFN.\n\nOf course, the exact value will not always be directly proportional to that of the American dollar, as through the proposed system, the OFN Monetary System will operate off of a band system, maintaining a price floor and ceiling, allowing for acceptable trade prices to be maintained, at least to some degree.§!"
 USA_WFB_CFN_reform_5_tt: "§WTariff Reform§!\n\n§FWhile the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade may sound mundane, the GATT is perhaps one of the most essential aspects to the economic mending of the OFN. through promoting international trade, the various economies of the OFN will only grow, though this wonderful advancement can only be reached if compromises are struck, and agreements are made.\n\nThrough deciding the place of trade barriers such as tariffs or quotas, as well as eliminating preferences on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis, we will be able to substantially increase trade, stimulate the economies of the OFN, and to closer mend our nations through breaking down the walls of tariffs that hold back economic progress and prosperity. Even still, free trade as an idea is political poison, and the RDC will need to swallow such a tough pill if we hope to bring further prosperity to the OFN.§!"

The administration's fiscal conservatism demands this halts immediately so the government can apportion tax dollars more judiciously; as well as explore other solutions to social and infrastructural maladies than vomiting Federal coffers dry into them. To prevent extremity from outdoing itself, Goldwater and company are pushing a cap to the debt ceiling. However, Goldwater knows from his Senate days that this manner of push may be fatally tainted from its outset. Knowing this, his cabinet is hiding a card deck of various spending stopgaps off the table to enter play in the event that the debt ceiling is allowed to fizz out of the bottle. The extraneous buck stops here."

In a White House Press Conference, President Goldwater himself has stood up for his proposals, saying that these programs have been given too freely in the past to \"... those that can, and should be working, but choose not to because they think the government can provide for them.\" But it's the last line that dominates headlines: \"Working men should work!\""

However, that can lead to situations where American made products are expensive and out of reach of millions of poorer Americans. Regan has proposed that maybe tariffs should be cut on imported goods from other countries, to allow cheaper products from overseas to provide for these markets that American companies aren't providing for. Plus, since the US isn't spending as much money on welfare anymore, we don't need to collect as much money as before. So why not make the accountants jobs at the Treasury Department a little bit easier?"

Patience with its engorged stature has only led to failure in the limited four year stints of other chief executives, and Goldwater refuses to be another complacent zookeeper that feeds into its bulk. The administration will begin an effective immediate lobby push for reduced social programs, moderate prohibitions on Federal loan taking, slashing a chunk from commerce regulations, particularly as levied at farmers, small businesses, and interstate merchants. Special, pricey, and cronyist protections for unions and massive companies: out. More money for defense, civil services, and necessary infrastructure: in. Cut the fat and produce a smaller budget in proportion to the realistically smaller legitimate duties of the Federal government."

With the lazy bums forced to find jobs since their monthly free money has vanished, there are now millions more people looking for work. So what if the bleeding heart liberals are crying at us for pushing poverty levels up? It's only because they aren't working hard enough. With an expanded workforce crying for jobs, we can now encourage companies to invest and build in America, making all the stuff our nation will ever need. They don't need to build their branch plants or invest overseas. We already have the largest single market in the world. America First!"

The American war machine hasn't thoroughly greased its joints in what seems like ages, and little eases friction in them quite like money for war machines and a place to send them. Needless to say, this entails a comprehensive austerity to reserve the funds for purchasing equipment, arms, and such; not to mention the scrap materials to manufacture them. Public allotments for social programs, subsidies, and commerce enforcements evaporate from their original applications and resurface back in the Defense Department's coffers via executive order and urgently phrased, persuasive communiques to Congress. The skin is pulled tight to Uncle Sam's face and he's letting the excess come out in munitions and engines to drive them to their scheduled destination."
 USA_gld_68_rumsfield's_plan: "럼즈펠드의 계획"
 USA_gld_68_rumsfield's_plan_desc: "A vaguely technocratic ideal of the military, Donald Rumsfeld's program is one for endorsing hardware over manpower, while paring down, refining, and reapplying the select droves of men we already have enlisted (usually in more sparing placements and field assaults, but on what are deemed to be more strategic contact points). Rumsfeld specifically has an interest in higher technology, aeronautic war-making, including using satellites more robustly, developing sleeker spy planes with better photographic powers, and honing airstrikes into a precise art form which devastate pressure points rather than merely carpet bombing South Africa into whatever predated the Stone Age. Goldwater in his air force background finds this appealing if a tad wishy-washy in its forcefulness. Nonetheless, it would prove an immense shift in American war doctrine, and, if the war is lost, we'll lose more money than men."

 USA_gld_68_mcnamara's_vision_desc: "In Washington quite a few of the big wigs in Goldwater's military cabinet, chiefly Robert McNamara, have had a mana from heaven realization; more troops mean we can simply swarm the RK forces with raw numbers. The Nazis are already reliant on strained slave labor conditions for their resources, even a good portion of their conscripts. If they can be exhausted thoroughly via good ole fashioned G.I. mass deployments and mass encirclements, they can be driven back, their resolve as well as their personnel depleted and broken. No nation on Earth save Japan could withstand the full blooming mobilization of America's young men against it all at once. Those paltry few that could would usually need weapons of mass destruction to definitively repel the pressurized application of so many well-coordinated invaders. Enough men will send the Reich packing, of this McNamara is positive."

 USA_gld_68_a_specialized_defense_desc: "The average grunt, noble though he is, is proving vastly insufficient to cope with the most battle-hardened RK units. In tandem with the adverse, novel climate in which the war is fought, such lack of veteran specialty in jungle combat is becoming disastrous for American forces. As such, the request has been made and granted for trained special forces units for whom underhanded, unorthodox warfare tailored to the difficult African climate is an object rather than an inconvenient resort. In lieu of overwhelming the Germans with old fashioned G.I.'s en masse, a more scalpel-esque approach will be adopted. Saliently, these divisions will engage the enemy in booby trapping, sabotage, guerrilla tactics, deep reconnaissance measures, skirmish and ambush oriented firefights; the genuine article of commando-focal warfare. If all goes swimmingly, the Nazis won't be able to out-adapt this rigorously versatile approach before it is far too late."

 USA_gld_68_better_vehicles_desc: "The country's armored warfare capacity is long overdue to be updated. This means introducing, manufacturing, and developing superior trucks, half-tracks, tank destroyers, and of course, tanks. With a fresh steel bulwark driving at their weary heels, the Krauts scarcely stand a chance. An increase in armored vehicles, particularly tanks will provide a boon, both literal and figurative to the average G.I. who will be able to call a much harder hammer down on skirmish prone swathes of RK-held territory. To boot, modern tanks can aid in the eventual push back to conventional war doctrine as the Germans are compelled to do battle in the open air as well as African villages."

 USA_gld_68_military_is_of_public_interest_desc: "Without our servicemen and their well-worked tools, the country's shores would fall to the jaws of fascism, and as such each sound man alive can see the import behind a well-muscled military. As a matter of national livelihood it should take a role on the center stage of government spending and prioritization. Greater portions of collected taxes will be delegated to the defense budget, and the budget itself will be marginally enlarged. Public support of the armed services will be encouraged, war austerity policies fostered, factory jobs lauded, and domestic morale safeguarded. The land of the free and the home of the brave will live up to its name under Goldwater as it has so many times before."
 USA_gld_68_land_air_integration: "공지합동"
 USA_gld_68_land_air_integration_desc: "Aerial warfare is precisely President Goldwater's wheelhouse as a senior USAAF veteran, a period in which he doubtlessly learned a key lesson about air support, which is that it can only reify ground troops' ability to function for so long, and with only so much efficacy in being high flying craft opposed to enemies well-equipped with flak cannons. That is, until the modern helicopter. Mobile, speedy, low flying, and bristling with machine guns, a properly outfitted Huey chopper is the new Sherman, and arguably less fragile. An encroachingly irreplaceable element for American G.I.'s as it ferries them with facility, speed, and force to each front as battles ever-changing-ly unfold; providing a formidable hailstorm of leaden cover fire whenever needed. Synthesized with hardened infantry, the helicopter and its tactics are a revolution in American war-making ability."

 USA_gld_68_specialized_demands_support_the_best_corporations_desc: "Immense arms have to be mustered against a foe that won't fight fair, even larger ones to strike them down once they are flushed out and forced to do battle on an even, open plain. The gargantuan demand for better guns has transformed into an equally exigent insistence for arms with growingly staggering caliber and destructive capacities. Larger artillery pieces, more efficient mortars, and bombs that can level the fortified installations which dapple the enemy's lines; anything with a bang big enough to ensure they think twice about advancing or sticking it out. The guns of Goldwater's service years are no more with modern technology coupled alongside the need to beat down a newer foe."
 USA_gld_68_limited_conscription: "제한적 징병"
 USA_gld_68_limited_conscription_desc: "With the war at hand, it is hardly unreasonable to start making some demands of those who live in this grand republic. Great men have to risk their lives for it without fail throughout the annals of history, and that time has come again, both for it and the liberty of our dear friends in Africa. Far from being lethally drastic; minimal conscription measures are what Goldwater has in mind. A selective service and lottery system will be more than apt to bring in the surplus manpower necessary to bow the head of the Reichskommissariats. Every man who gives his life for Africa's liberty will go down as a hero, and those heroes who haven't stepped forward may yet be found."

 USA_gld_68_lessons_from_saf_desc: "It occurs to any forward thinking man of war or the world that one can only wage war as successfully as he knows the grounds where he wages it. It's about time we took measures from the playbook of the local guerrilla fighters and integrated them into our own combat doctrines. As our allies they should be more than willing to aid the force superior in strength to them on their side. That might will only supplement their own so much if it is left to languish confused as it is consistently outwitted by a far more locally acclimated enemy. Spotting unique styles of booby trap, learning what to listen for in the underbrush, and understanding ambush positions in the foliage before they can be sprung among other things will all work towards our boys' favor."

 USA_gld_68_well_trained_men_need_good_guns_desc: "The firepower needed to raze the fascists from their jungle roosts has proven to be greater than ever imagined. More of the defense budget will be repurposed towards the manufacture of only the finest quality of mass issue small arms, and new designs befitting a jungle soldier's war considered for service. Flame-based and explosive projectile weapons capable of being fielded by small companies, platoons, and squads will also enter development and selection to enable their progress through the sweltering verdure populated with Nazis. There are few things that can overpower a vile jackboot, but a preponderance of arsenal in the hands of hardy G.I.'s is among them."

To put it mildly, this translates to yet another upping for the military's ever flowering new demands, with another matched-ly extensive addition to their coffers. War and its fruits are never costless, such is the eternal burden of free, fiercely principled nations who must resort to it against such tyrannies as the Nazis. Arms and armor manufacturing, conscription, and industrial production orders will all measurably intensify for the war effort's sake, without which victory is forsaken."

 USA_gld_68_more_men_more_munitions_desc: "It's an imperishable fact of armed struggle that you never know the lengths to which your dedication and nation may be tried. The manufacturing foundries which fuel the conflict's success must be tried yet further with an increase in locales, loans, and assembly lines to get more guns, gear, vehicles, and shells to the latest wave of valiant young Americans to stomp the RK's guts out. Regarding those courageous youth; there simply are not enough of them in the service to deploy against the Reich's tides. Conscription will be accelerated to meet the call of duty against the unrelenting Nazi specter. No man can fight forever, which is why fresh faces with fresh reserves of combat vigor must sally forth to crush the fascists head on. With their well-oiled tools, they will end this, for as Goldwater knows, you don't start a fight you have no intention of finishing."
 USA_gld_68_military_keynesianism: "군사적 케인스주의"
 USA_gld_68_military_keynesianism_desc: "Keynes may have been a fool in most respects, but at least he grasped the needs of wartime production and the benefits it confers for the larger market economy. The debt we owe to our coffers is negligible against the backdrop of the ferocious clash throughout the bottommost ranges of Africa. The prospective boom from cycling against the ravages of war with raw production is tempting to say the least too. Reganist financial doctrines shift to reflect a Keynesian, demand-focused military industrial policy that the administration is convinced can give the desired push that will collapse the enemy's resolve through sheer, brute war production overclocking. The war has to be fought, and political economy cannot stand in the way."

 USA_gld_68_the_best_defense_is_a_funded_military_desc: "A full, Congressionally mandated budget increase for our defense has been called for, and with the raging, pitched inferno covering South Africa, it is inevitably necessary. If the Reich cannot be halted in Africa, Lord knows what they may be bold enough to attempt next, anything on the spectrum from strikes using weapons of mass destruction to another global conquest; the likes of which has not been seen for years. Safety can always be bought in more guns and war supplies, so why not secure oneself in the event of Reich getting any more audacious or threatening they already are? The war's continued frustrations are proof positive that it's a warranted concern, and that decisive victory requires decisive commitment with considerable sums of pure cash."
 USA_gld_68_a_modern_banking_system: "현대적 은행 제도"
 USA_gld_68_a_modern_banking_system_desc: "The Interstate Banking Act of [GetYear] is now on President Goldwater's desk, one of his pet projects. For years the various states have put up barriers to the workings of financial institutions, forcing banks to keep their money in their states and not transfer the money where it needs to go. Some of the smaller states are pleading for more money to invest into their economies, but the larger states jealously guard the money, seeking to keep it where it already is. But with regulations slashed and taxes dropped, soon the local and regional banks that were long complacent will have to compete again, which will only help small businesses and entrepreneurs to get the financing they need to get growing."
 USA_gld_68_mortons_plan: "모턴의 계획"
 USA_gld_68_mortons_plan_desc: "Not everyone is on board with Regan's bold schemes to change the economic future of America. Some oppose it altogether, of course, but they weren't voting for us anyways. More importantly, however, is the opposition to Regan's plan within our party, led by Thurston Ballard Morton. Morton's clique, large and growing, objects to Regan's most outlandish plans and aims to reel his ambitions back in.\n\nTheir ideas heavily lean on massive expansion of trade with OFN allies, as well as using said trade leverage as political power in international politics. By strengthening our trade bonds with our allies, they say, we will both solidify our economy at home and our reputation abroad. It's important to note that these plans do not entirely conflict with Goldwater's own views, and that the President and Morton are quite aligned. Siding with Morton would, if anything, strengthen the President's bonds with the RDC.\n\nOf course, such an alliance would require compromising on some of President Goldwater's deepest-held values, and Regan is staunchly against any infringement on what he sees as both his and the Administration's responsibility. On the other hand, going with Regan would risk the plan failing in Congress - a much less likely outcome with Morton's plans, even if ultra-conservatives rejected the compromise in protest.\n\nPerhaps it's worth listening to what the moderates have to say."

In fact, it is imperative that America should trade with the world, especially with the anti-fascist Free World. The resources of Canada, South Africa, Australia and Latin America is worth a pretty penny, and they in turn can purchase products made in factories in the States, which will only require more resources, which will result in more money for them to spend on goods Made in America, and the cycle will continue, on and on, making everyone richer and happier.

However, the leaders of the Republican-Democratic Coalition, blindsided by the President's announcement, are horrified. Embargoing the largest markets in the world for being brutal dictatorships could cause a lot of economic chaos since the members of the OFN are a lot smaller economically, as they can't afford to buy all of America's goods.

But no longer. We will make the right choice. We must make the right choice!\"\n\nThe President has made \"The Goldwater Way\" position crystal clear: either stand with our allies and our freedoms, or to continue trading with murderers and criminals.

While businessmen in New York and the politicans in Washington in their pockets will complain, it's a popular idea with everyday Americans. After all, buying products made by slave labor or under oppressive regimes is tantamount to supporting them, and all red-blooded, freedom loving citizens of the US will never stop that low."

Any economist or business leader who dared to publically state that banning trade with the largest nations on earth could be detreminetal to the American economy have been denounced as \"fear mongers\" and \"Nazi sympathizers.\"\n\nBut the bill has passed the House in large numbers, and with a healthy majority in the Senate, though some notable RDC members voted against it. Most of them won't be seeing re-election next time, Goldwater is sure. But in a ceremony in the Oval Office recorded on camera, the Free Trade Act is signed, and it's official.

Big-shot liberals like to talk about their social programs and their massive government expansions, but they never seem to dwell too long on the price tag of their pet projects. Year after year, America has been forced to watch helplessly as their representatives drive their taxes higher and higher, ravaging their wages with inflation and bloating their government into an unrecognizable morass of waste and corruption. President Goldwater has no intentions of standing for this any longer.\n\nOne reason for this glut in spending is the almost comically weak debt ceiling that America has in place today. Weakly enforced and almost powerless in effect, the debt ceiling has been trampled again and again by the big-spending Washingtonians - a useless speed bump instead of a hard guardrail.\n\nBy working within the Senate, President Goldwater will change that. The debt ceiling will no longer be made of paper, but will be instead replaced with a concrete limit, a red line that tells Capitol Hill - and the nation - that reckless spending will not go beyond this point. Then, and only then, will the process of cutting government down to size become a true movement.\n\nAfter all, what good is policy if it gets reversed in four years time?"

Really, all they've done is strangle the life out of those entrepreneurial pioneers who boldly march America forwards, tightening the noose even as hard-working Americans gasp for help. It falls to us to cut that rope, and free the market once again.\n\nIn general, the smaller the government, the better, as Goldwater argues. Getting Washington out of the way of the liberty of the people to do what they'd like with their money and ideas is more difficult than it should be, but it is not impenetrable - soon, business owners will find their hands untied and free to build new prosperity for America to share in, and they'll know to thank the President for it."

Tax-and-spend liberals see no problem with this, of course, but President Goldwater knows better than to shut his eyes to the danger.\n\nThe interest rates that the government pays seem to grow every year, taking more money out of the average American's pocket, and it's past time that that trend was reversed. By contacting the Federal Reserve, the President will lower interest rates on the rapidly expanding debt, stunting its growth in its tracks. Not only will this stuff the growth of the debt, but it will also stimulate economic growth in the private sector. Goldwater wins, business owners win, and Americans win. What's not to like?"

Presidents before Goldwater were too weak, too passive, or even too attached to this back-door dealing to do anything about it, but President Goldwater has no such hesitation.\n\nWith haste, we shall get to work in plugging these leaks that allow millions of taxpayer dollars to fall into the hands of the greedy, ensuring that only projects that really need the money get their funds. The citizens have less of their hard-earned cash taken out of their paycheck, the projects that truly need funding get dollars once earmarked to politician's bank accounts, and the President strikes yet another blow against the big-government interests that have held our nation down."

 USA_gld_68_ensuring_a_strong_dollar_desc: "The American Dollar has long been one of the most important currencies in the world, rivaled only by the German Reichsmark and the Japanese Yen as the world's reserve currency. However, it's been left to float free for a while now, which causes rapid rises and falls depending on the markets and politics. This has caused uncertainty and economic issues for years now, but now President Goldwater wants to stabilize the system. A whole suite of executive orders and laws have been proposed to keep the dollar stable. The goals should be to get the value of the dollar compared to the Reichsmark and the Yen, as well as OFN currencies, that should be perfect for businesses who want a lower dollar to encourage exports, and for companies that want a stronger dollar to make importing from other countries less expensive. While we can't please both sides at once, we can at least keep them in balance, and ensure prosperity for all."

 USA_gld_68_north_american_trade_cooperation_desc: "The final step to weaning the American economy off the fascists is to bring North America closer together. Canada has been in lockstep with our economy ever since the collapse of the British Empire. Mexico, while not part of the OFN, has always been a major trade partner. But now is the time to reduce all the trade barriers between our nations, implement standardizations in our economies, and bring everyone together in peace and prosperity. It is time to negotiate the North American Trade Cooperation Agreement (NATC). We will provide millions of dollars to help build up industries in both countries to the same standards as ours in interest free loans, and in turn we will make it easier for them to sell their resources, such as oil, food, iron ore, aluminum, and more, to America. It's a win-win-win!"

Other bonuses including reducing inflation, keeping government spending under control, and generally making the US a better place to do business with. With a strong dollar and fixed exchange rates, America will no longer be tied to the whims of dictators across the sea playing with their levers of control to undermine the United States like they have done before. Never again will the dollar be held hostage by a fascist state!"

But Goldwater's hard work has paid off. The economy is roaring! Businesses are expanding rapidly, the GDP is growing at record rates, and everyone that wants one has a job and enough income to not only get the essentials, but all the consumer goods they ever needed. America looks forward to the future with pride and optimism, casting aside the doldrums of an old generation."

 USA_gld_68_a_militarized_economy_desc: "The Second World War showed us that we cannot allow ourselves to be caught flat footed again. One of the biggest problems we had was our industry was in poor shape to rapidly switch to military production from consumer goods. Therefore, a series of semi-private military companies are being set up around the nation to serve as the new backbone of the Military-Industrial Complex. Freedom isn't Free, as much as we would like to say so. We must be prepared to fight for the freedom of America, of the OFN, of all freedom loving people around the world. To do that, we will need the weapons of war."

Oil refineries are straining at their limit as the number of cars on the roads skyrockets, which makes gasoline way too expensive. These and many other businesses across the country need a bit of help. Even though Goldwater is a Free Market proponent, he has agreed to help set up a series of part private, part state owned businesses to help keep the economy going. They will get loans and grants from the federal government to get started, but will act as private businesses otherwise, selling their products on the open, Free Market. This will go a long way to stimulating the economy of the US, the OFN, and the world at large."

Now it can be said that he has come closer than any President of the United States to turn water into gold. America now has, unquestionably, the most powerful economy in the world, riding high on Free Trade, Limited Government, and American Ingenuity. With this combination of ingredients, the United States is well poised for the future."

Swayed by fiery, passionate rhetoric aimed at the corrupt bosses who sought to undermine our great democracy in the name of Marx and Lenin, strongarming hard-working Americans left with no other choice but to contribute to their glorified protection racket, the American people have given him the mandate to excise this grave threat lurking in plain sight.\n\nBuoyed by their trust, the President has chosen to dedicate his energies in the coming days to make plans for the task which he had been entrusted.

If we wish to keep our nation safe from these radicals, we must fight fire with fire. President Goldwater has ordered for another round of investigation on the NPP. The government will use every method we have against them, and we will bring them down, destroy their reputation, and lift those misguided fools who have fallen for the siren song of communism or fascism back to the light of democracy.\n\nSome of these methods taken may not be legal. Some of these methods may not be moral. In the end, however, it will all be worth it. If American democracy is not protected and these traitors win an election, it will spell the doom of our nation!\n\nSome advisors say that we are walking in the same steps as Nixon did on his road to impeachment. These cowards seem to think that we will commit the same mistakes as he did. No doubt they would hand over the White House to Yockey and his gang. Goldwater knows what he is doing, and he will keep the tightest lid on any of the more shady parts of this operation.\n\nAfter all, perhaps Nixon had some good ideas when it came to suppression."

In such a manner does it get zealous servants while only paying them pennies and a pat on the back for their good work.\n\nUnsurprisingly, their spawn the trade unions emulate its progenitor. America's unions get membership dues and oaths of loyalty out of their peons, and nothing to give them but the euphoria of belonging to some \"higher cause\". A card of pyramids held together by simple gravity. But with one good kick, believes President Goldwater, it might just come crashing down..."

A mob, regardless of ideology, will always rally around men of action and results -- men who have proven their worth in the eyes of their lessers, and who have the means to direct their zeal towards their cause's ends. Equally true, then, is its corollary: That a mob scatters like dust before wind without a leader to guide them.\n\nFor a movement that derives its strength from countless many mobs, an equally countless number of leaders is their direst necessity... and their weakest link. The next step forward has thus revealed itself in the eyes of President Goldwater's vengeful government."

Instead it has amassed strength with every convert, turning into a beast stained with the crimson of its terrible banners. No force seems enough to banish it fully, as if it were a hydra that gains a hundred heads for each severed neck. Why and how socialism has become so is a query that has driven many conservatives to drink and desperate prayer -- even while a red noose tightens around their own necks.\n\nThe President does not wish to give the socialists any further opportunities to oust him from the White House. To that end, Director Hoover shall task his agents to uncover the nature of America's red hydra, and how it gains such widespread appeal with such a God-fearing people as Americans."

The same can be said of any effort to definitively end the socialist menace; let foster the schemes which breed socialist thought, and there will be no end in sight for the riots and rebels socialism inevitably spawns.\n\nIn any case, President Goldwater already has his hands full dealing with the red bastards who've already organized. Painstaking progress has been made to isolate them from their sources of support -- progress easily undone if newer unions were to spring out like summer pox. He believes that imposing additional restrictions in establishing new trade unions will further weaken the extant unions to a point where he can do away with them in one fell swoop."

 USA_gld_68_from_blacklist_to_whitelist_desc: "In dealing with American society's more seditious elements, the federal government's extensive security and intelligence apparatuses have taken to keeping an equally-extensive register of persons who had been, have been, or are suspected of having engaged themselves in illegal or traitorous activities. The thinking goes that such elements should be isolated away from where they can do the most harm. Spies and smugglers make up a healthy portion of these registers, although criminals and rabble-rousers form their majorities.\n\nThe converse of this \"blacklist\" is a register of individuals who have demonstrated deep loyalty to America and its laws. Investigating loyal citizens is a fruitless, wasteful endeavor; thus, President Goldwater believes his anti-corruption campaign is best served with a whitelist for the most exceptional members of his party."

Man is easy to tempt away from their duties with money as it is; with the stakes involved in the formulation and implementation of laws, money tends to appear to Beltway officials and employees like oases of manna in the dry desert. Incidentally, America's trade unions happen to be among the largest sources of this sweet, sticky fluid, tempting Senators with an ear for the common man with bribes for \"the common good\".\n\nThus, the Goldwater administration now sets its sights on Senators and their past and present affiliations. They can take care of snooping around for \"conflicts of interest\" with trade unions; an incensed public will do the bludgeoning for the President."

One need only look at the first hundred years since it crawled out of Marx's orifices to make patterns: Agitators, bomb throwers, harassers, vandals, reds and blacks sweeping over paralyzed nations in a tidal wave, causing the fall of empires and the suffering of millions. In democracies, that wave tended to strike on Election Day.\n\nPresident Goldwater knows the unions will do their skulduggery leading up to the elections, and has drawn plans with Director Hoover to nip their rituals before they can unleash October surprises of their own."

To be specific, certain Senators in... \"labor-friendly\" states, in a manner of speaking. Lamentably, even statesmen of such caliber are not immune to pecuniary concerns -- and it is these concerns which bosses of ill-begotten wealth and renown offer to ameliorate. For a price, of course; after all, it is only fair for a man to ask compensation of equal value to his services.\n\nAnd so, with bare-naked bribes conducted behind doors, the reprehensible are shielded against justice's otherwise terrible reproach by a bulwark of pocket-bulging Congressmen. President Goldwater believes addressing this, with the hammer of public opinion if need be, takes precedence over other concerns."

An ideal world might grant their wishful thinking some physical manifestation; alas, no man in this sinful Earth is rid of it, not completely. And politicians, as centuries of human history has demonstrated, tend to bear more sins than any other man, in pursuit of their coveted positions. Senators are no different in this respect.\n\nIn most cases their reputation is their first and only bulwark against the truth, yet one which has proved its resilience time after time. But with the right attack ads -- messy, unglamorous, dishonorable attack ads -- at the right occasion, a skillful man can bypass this bulwark and illuminate these hidden sins for all of America to see."

 USA_gld_68_some_unregistered_gifts_shouldnt_bring_it_crashing_down_desc: "Moral quandaries and dilemmas are typical of any government in any nation in written history, and rightly so. After all, decisions which change the lives of millions never come without benefits and drawbacks, and not treating them with the gravity reserved for dilemmas enables decisions that can easily undo centuries of sound governance in a fraction of the time. These dilemmas are uncomfortable to face, albeit a necessary discomfort for good policymaking.\n\nAt present, President Goldwater faces one such dilemma in the form of some... unregistered gifts, just uncovered by some curious government auditors. Would if they belonged to the hawks; alas, their receipts bore the names of elephants and donkeys instead. Perhaps hard times call for hard decisions...?"
 USA_gld_68_exonerate_the_rds: "RDC 무고 입증"
 USA_gld_68_exonerate_the_rds_desc: "The Republican-Democratic Coalition is the last bastion of normalcy that reigned before the Great Depression, and its two halves the architects of America's recovery in the leadup to the Second World War. It is the greatest compromise American politics has witnessed -- for two foes locking horns since before the Civil War to dispense of their enmities and join hands says more than enough of their earnest belief in the country's long-term future. A complement which hardly applies to the Frankenstein of an opposition that seeks to counter their every move in Congress.\n\nValues shine brightest in times of adversity, and through their partnership the Republican-Democrats have demonstrated values worth fostering in the country's otherwise decrepit and lackadaisical politics. President Goldwater sees no need to disturb this relationship by bandying empty accusations over their income."
 USA_gld_68_the_big_bad: "빅 배드"
 USA_gld_68_the_big_bad_desc: "Like a demon from Scripture, trade unionism casts its blood-crimson shadow over the good men and women of America. The sharp edges of its manyfold jagged teeth glimmer as daggers against pale moonlight, ready to sink deep into fair Columbia's unsuspecting flesh and veins. What sort of beast must it be that it can bear its terrible implements with little in either recognition or repercussion from America's God-fearing folk!\n\nFortunately, this red-tainted beast is not as invulnerable as it is terrifying. The American people united can be fashioned into a sword that strikes true at its heart, made sharper with whetstones of knowledge. President Goldwater plans to seek out notable actors to fashion such whetstones with their wit and charisma -- and as if by Providence's command, one promising Ronald Reagan has immediately answered his call..."
 USA_gld_68_the_afl_cio: "AFL-CIO"
 USA_gld_68_the_afl_cio_desc: "The AFL-CIO has reigned supreme over the quiltwork of American unions ever since their Faustian merger in the mid-fifties. In the frightable perceptions of your lay American, this \"national union\" controls a nationwide network of bosses, bribes and vassals from their velvet chairs in Washington, like puppet masters toying with the marionette strings of their servile dolls.\n\nThis, of course, cannot be any further from the truth. The union today operates as its constituent parts have always had since the age of letter and telegram: A cartel of organizations that have given the country's labor geographical bounds, organizing them into territories for each to rule as they see fit. With the symbol they present, and the cracks they offer unawares, President Goldwater has made it his ambition to split this beast into pieces before he leaves office."
 USA_gld_68_the_attorney_generals_report: "법무장관의 보고"
 USA_gld_68_the_attorney_generals_report_desc: "The Attorney General of the United States is the greatest legal consultant the federal government has in its arsenal. The President may represent the American people, but his Constitutionally-mandated lawyer represents America as a whole in courtrooms both foreign and domestic. His words carry the weight of a bicentennial superpower, and the targets of his ire become unwilling volunteers for demonstrations of its sheer resources and patience...\n\n...Which is why enlisting his help is crucial for the task at hand. By preparing a scathing report against the AFL-CIO, packed with all the dirt the FBI can get its hands on, President Goldwater will have all the excuse he needs to file a ruinous lawsuit against America's most malignant union."
 USA_gld_68_go_with_what_we_have: "우리가 가진 것들로 가자"
 USA_gld_68_go_with_what_we_have_desc: "Nearly two centuries have passed since the Founders have uttered their inalienable truths, and now truth is rarer than it has ever been before. Duplicity and corruption stain all discourse and business with murky black ink -- a putrid, oily and slimy backdrop against what in better times would have been picturesque communities filled with the pleasantries of brotherly love. But it is in such despair where pinpricks of earnest truth shine brightest, giving hearts the strength to lift their burdens one day more.\n\nPresident Goldwater's greatest weapon against the AFL-CIO is just that: Earnest, naked truth. He has faith it will carry him through better than Director Hoover's increasingly hairbrained schemes, at least."
 USA_gld_68_a_limited_case: "제한된 사례들"
 USA_gld_68_a_limited_case_desc: "So many ways the case can go -- and if President Goldwater were being honest, not a lot of them had the victory he wanted to happen. On the contrary, most he thought of had him eating crow as the Supreme Court shoots his case down in front of national television and two hundred million pairs of eyes. This paled, of course, to the worst case scenario: Hoover's boys getting caught where they shouldn't, kicking off yet another political meltdown so soon after the Nixon scandal.\n\nSo in his wisdom, he decided to stick with the arguments he's absolutely certain will make a compelling case. All white collar crimes and old boys' networks, only sparking interest because of a fresh coat of red paint. Much less glamorous than smoking guns, but leagues safer and ironclad regardless."
 USA_gld_68_the_constitution_demands_it: "헌법이 이를 요구한다"
 USA_gld_68_the_constitution_demands_it_desc: "In his eyes, President Goldwater saw himself as nothing less than a devoted adherent to America's Constitution. And why shouldn't he be? The document is the bedrock atop which the nation is built, the basis of its core essence and distinctive character. The crystallization of the Founders' hopes and dreams, the fruit of their effort, their last gift to their children, that they may live and die free -- to deviate from it is nothing less than heresy against America itself.\n\nWith the rise of socialism, more have strayed away from America and into heresy. Any good American would be incensed at their gall, but only the greatest few would rise above as the Constitution calls loud for aid. Let her government's people be assured: They have placed their trust in one such great few last Election Day, and he shall not shirk from it."
 USA_gld_68_its_not_enough: "충분하지 않다!"
 USA_gld_68_its_not_enough_desc: "Time was something President Goldwater had precious little, and his adversaries plenty; if they absolutely must, the unions can just dig their heels and drag the hearings out until half of America boots him from the White House next elections for doing nothing in their eyes. For a feat as big as bringing the AFL-CIO down, nothing's ever enough for him.\n\nFactor in the FBI, however, and... well, he'll have a bigger shot in bringing them down, at least. And wasn't it said that fortune most favored the bold?"
 USA_gld_68_self_made_man_self_made_evidence: "스스로 성공한 사람, 스스로 만든 증거"
 USA_gld_68_self_made_man_self_made_evidence_desc: "Director Hoover has prepared the documents: forgeries, stolen mementos, coerced testimonies. At the President's word, agents in every major American city will receive their orders and begin the largest ever infiltration campaign the FBI has ever conducted. Disposable, nondescript -- no less a John Q. Public than the civilian beside them -- and devoted to the crusade, the Director's pawns will see to it that America will wake up with news of socialist skulduggery conveniently unearthed.\n\nIf nothing else, all good Americans can have a chuckle over seeing 'self-made men' become undone by... self-made evidence, suppose to say."
 USA_gld_68_american_federation_of_labor: "미국노동연맹"
 USA_gld_68_american_federation_of_labor_desc: "The American Federation of Labor forms one half of the largest socialist hydra terrorizing American labor today. But these union bosses have the genteel their 'fraternal comrades' don't, born as they are from the more respectable, well-meaning artisans of the Gilded Age: clerks, foremen, teachers. They carry themselves with the grace and good manners that befit their well-maintained clothing and unblemished countenance; again, unlike the unwashed masses that compose their 'fraternal comrades'.\n\nSuch differences have contributed to an underlying tension among the two, though until now their mutual antipathy against the current state of things has prevented it from becoming an ignorable issue. President Goldwater believes there is merit in exploiting the AFL's hypocrisies in full view of the American people, both to galvanize his cause's support and undermine theirs."
 USA_gld_68_congress_of_industrial_organisations: "산업조직회의"
 USA_gld_68_congress_of_industrial_organisations_desc: "The Congress of Industrial Organizations forms one half of the largest socialist hydra terrorizing American industry today. They are the bilge rats, roaches and locusts every God-fearing man abhors: drunkards, wife-beaters, lazy workers all. They demand the \"right\" to shamble into work with the dignity of a vagrant and exert no more than four hours' worth of work into the American economy. Fueled as they are by base, narrow-minded desire, it is a wonder how they were able to organize at all.\n\nThe President will not offer the CIO the same leniency he does to their 'fraternal comrades'. Director Hoover will be delighted to hear of more opportunities to practice his agency's competence in... clandestine operations, so to say."
 USA_gld_68_usa_vs_aflcio: "USA 대 AFL-CIO"
 USA_gld_68_usa_vs_aflcio_desc: "Tomorrow will arrive the prophesied day of reckoning. A million man-hours spent painstakingly constructing the case against trade unionism, both legally and illegally, now begins to make their weight known in the court of law.\n\nHow many nights has Barry Goldwater spent poring over case files, apprising Hoover and his goons, practising his sermon-like speeches decrying the unions lording over American workers for their supposed benefit? Coffee was the blood of God Himself; however, even holy water has limits. And Barry felt he had surpassed every known limit it's ever had since he began his crusade.\n\nHe sighed, sinking deep into the Oval Office's velvet chair. God will protect His own tomorrow morning."

 USA_gld_68_the_american_nature_desc: "America's lush, fertile lands are blessed by God Himself. From the thunderous roars of Niagara Falls' waters to the Grand Canyon's towering ravines, not one inch of America's three thousand-mile length lacks in the divine beauty envied by men and sung by its poets. Its forests, its waters, its hills and fields and mountains -- our nation's natural plenty is and should be an object of pride for those fortunate to call these their own.\n\nYet men still seek to imperil America's pristine majesties with misdeeds to sate their own greed; much of them, in fact, are companies with the gall to call themselves Americans. President Goldwater may be an ardent believer in free enterprise, but above all he is the democratically elected steward of the Lord's most beautiful creation. No burden is too heavy, nor cost too great, against their defense from the corrupting tendrils of mankind's pollution."
 USA_gld_68_the_yellowstone_speech_desc: "What first comes to mind when President Goldwater thinks of America's natural beauty is the mighty, watery bellows of Yellowstone National Park's Old Faithful. The ancient caldera's most famous geyser forcefully ejects jets of superheated water from Earth to Heaven, seeming to all and sundry like a wrathful pillar from the Old Testament. Yet for all its awe-inspiring power, Old Faithful and its adjunct supervolcano is helpless against the clouds of industrial smoke that clog its airs, or against the heaps of scrap metal that defile its lands and waters.\n\nThe President feels it is only fitting to announce his next great effort before such a strong, yet helpless creation -- for is that not what now best describes American nature?"
 USA_gld_68_the_enviromental_protection_agency_desc: "Despite his support for the states' constitutional rights, President Goldwater acknowledges that some responsibilities are too extensive for any one state to handle themselves. Aside from interstate commerce and foreign policy, he also believes environmental protection is a burden only the federal government can guaranteeably shoulder. Thus, a hypothetical \"Environmental Protection Agency\" will better harness the country's will towards the stewardship of its natural bounty than the quiltwork, often underfunded programs of its individual states.\n\nThe President has directed his staff to draft plans for such an agency, keeping in mind the likelihood that Congress and its lobbyists will approve of it. If they won't, then... well, the White House will cross that bridge in good time."
 USA_gld_68_anti_corruption_measures_desc: "It is said that Congressmen convene in Capitol Hill to vote bills into law, but convene on the backrooms of K Street to draft and plan them. Meanwhile, the big names of the donor circles would hover by Senators and Representatives' shoulders to ensure that these bills satisfy, or at least do not affect overmuch, their paymasters' bottom lines. An undemocratic travesty it may be, but such is as part of life in the Beltway as sunshine and traffic jams. Presidents who fail to take the lobbyists' grip into account become lame ducks after their first hundred days.\n\nPresident Goldwater thinks likewise -- but not to appease them. He seeks ways to instead sideline them with corruption charges long before they inevitably become obstacles standing between the EPA bill and the Resolute Desk."
 USA_gld_68_investigate_the_legal_possibilities_desc: "Good lawmakers know what provisions their bills can cover without running afoul of already established precedents. To the dismay of American environmentalists, we've had nearly two centuries of precedent in allowing our captains of industry to dismantle the country's forests and pollute its waters for the sake of progress. This trend had suffered somewhat in President Roosevelt's heyday, but not to the point where environmental legislation can pass through Congress without heavy opposition.\n\nNevertheless, President Goldwater has begun consulting his most trusted advisors regarding the EPA bill's shape. At this time, Secretary Regan and Vice President Judd hold conflicting opinions over how much power the new agency should have to fulfill its mandate."
 USA_gld_68_expand_the_national_parks_desc: "President Grant had made the prescient decision to set aside a parcel of America's thousands of square miles from civilization in 1872. Since then, the registry of the now-named National Parks have been updated 31 more times. These vast natural preserves are the jewels of our country's natural beauty, filled with flora and fauna only their ecosystems can support... but as it is the law recognizes only 32. We have much more than that.\n\nLet the damn fool Republicans, Democrats, and National Progressives call him a tree-hugging hippie as much as they like, but President Goldwater will gladly draw money from the budget to protect more square miles, enroll more of America's natural wonders into the registry of National Parks."
 USA_gld_68_increase_national_park_funding_desc: "We may pass however many environmental acts we wish, but the trees and fish won't care any less for the borders we set, or for the penalties we enforce. Governments will hence always have a need for people to uphold its ordinances involving its voiceless, unheeding domains.\n\nThe good men and women of the National Park Service are assigned this important task for all laws related to its special preserves. Like all federal agencies, the NPS needs money from Congress to do its job well. The White House feels they need the cash injection more than most, and has drafted this year's budget with the National Parks' proper protection and management well in mind."
 USA_gld_68_the_clean_water_act_desc: "Clean water is more than just water to safely drink. Clean water is water free of metals and plastics, for to water our farms and let breathe our fishes. Clean water is water free of taint, giving whatever landscape it courses a beautiful trail of shimmering blue. Clean water is water unblemished by the hands of men, made closer to Providence for its existence alone. It is through laws and decrees that such hands are kept away from such a precious resource, for as recent memory unfortunately shows, men are happy to corrupt clean water into impure water without the visible hand of government to chastize their foolery.\n\nNow more than ever, President Goldwater believes, the federal government needs such laws before America's fresh waters are polluted fully. He will not find many allies in Congress for this purpose -- the left prefer their handouts uncompromised by nature's laments, whereas the right bleat about yet another of a million supposed federal overreaches -- but the President himself remains undeterred over his commitment to walking life's narrow gate."
 USA_gld_68_send_it_through_congress_desc: "After weeks of compromising, appeasing, negotiating and strongarming, the National Environmental Policy Act is finally ready to be voted upon in both houses of Congress. For a bill with just as much bipartisan opposition as bipartisan support, the passage of one of President Goldwater's major pieces of legislation is by no means certain according to observers and insider information.\n\n...When asked about his outlook for the law's fate, the President said that he \"will personally see to the enactment of a greener America's herald, no matter the cost...\""
 USA_gld_68_a_green_future_desc: "History is wont to write hagiographies of its great men one moment and hurl diatribes of their failings the next. One need look no further than the esteemed line of Presidents to see this phenomenon in question: According to literature, George Washington was both America's beloved pater patriae and a slave owning tyrant. These very same books lift Abraham Lincoln up as a paragon of American virtue, at the same time denouncing his heavy handed suppression of American freedoms under the duress of war.\n\nDecades from now, Barry Goldwater will meet their inevitable judgement like the Presidents before him. What Goldwater will their narrative depict? He hoped it would be Goldwater the environmentalist: The ardent champion of the greatest among the American people's shared heritages. But it was equally likely that the Goldwater they paint will resemble a tree-hugging dictator more than a civilized man.\n\nWith a swig, Barry emptied his mug before forcing his attention towards other Presidential matters. He can mull over his reputation after he gets out of office. For now, America has an infestation of extremists to exterminate."
 USA_gld_68_shady_measures_desc: "One morning, when Regan was exchanging barbs with the Federal Reserve in the Treasury Building, McNamara was crunching his numbers in the Pentagon with Curtis, and Judd was calming long-time Republican donors in some fancy restaurant in downtown DC, Director Hoover made his appearance in the Oval Office with a modest proposal tucked in his underarm. Washington's own kingmaker was straightforward enough: If President Goldwater required the FBI's help in uncovering \"compromising information\" about America's extremists, then he need only ask.\n\nIn better times, the Director's offer would merit a warning shot for its sheer unconstitutionality. On the other hand, it would sure be nice to see the country's miscreants behind bars before they poison its politics any further. Maybe ratfuckery is slightly more tolerable if it's for a good cause...?"
 USA_gld_68_IRS_audits_desc: "Al Capone's sprawling empire of bootleggers and mafiosos went under not because of his misdeeds as head of the infamous Chicago Outfit, but because of a record of tax evasion sniffed out by none other than the Internal Revenue Service. Say what you will about America's pencil-pushing tax collectors, but they must have done something right if they were able to accomplish what so many commissioners either can't or won't.\n\nPresident Goldwater aims to use the IRS as a weapon like in the Prohibition, but against America's domestic enemies this time around. Targeted investigations over extremists' finances will eventually trip over a case of fraud, evasion or embezzlement, giving us all the excuse we need to shut their gatherings down when we see them."
 USA_gld_68_create_blacklists_desc: "\"To curtail the influence of extremism in the United States, the President has approved a confidential record of persons with confirmed or suspected links to extremist groups. The names in this watchlist shall be kept under heightened surveillance by the appropriate law enforcement agencies -- that means us, by the way -- in order to evaluate the risk they pose to the government and the American people at large through their activities.\"\n\n\"All evidence gathered from enforcement of the watchlist are deemed admissible under court. Under threat of expulsion and a minimum sentence of ten years, agents aware of the watchlist are forbidden from confirming its existence to the general public until or unless the President himself deems it necessary...\""
 USA_gld_68_supress_there_votes_arrest_there_leaders_desc: "We've gathered enough material from the first few names in President Goldwater's new watchlist to issue warrants for their arrest with a healthy degree of plausible deniability on our part. Seeing the program's overwhelming success, he has encouraged the FBI to expand the list with the names it's comfortable going after.\n\nIf everything goes as planned, then American extremism will eventually be found only within the grey bar hotel, kept far away from the rest of society."
 USA_gld_68_focus_on_the_socialists_desc: "Fascism may be one of America's most hated enemies, but it is also among its youngest. In due time the inefficiencies of such an embryonic ideology will manifest, and its adherents will be swept like sand onto history's dustbin by waves of either reform or revolution. For the empire of liberty's ancient ideals, fascism is merely a twinkle it is destined to outlast.\n\nThe same cannot be said for its other nemesis. Clothed in blood-stained red parroting the false German prophet's heresies, socialism has left more scars on Uncle Sam and his children than all the world's fascists put together. Like the hydra of myth, socialism grows despite injuries that would kill lesser men, and it will return to our shores again and again until our cities are crushed beneath its crimson feet.\n\nAll American Presidents are duty-bound to cull socialism before it grows into a juggernaut. President Goldwater sees no reason to abandon this responsibility."
 USA_gld_68_ostracize_the_far_left_desc: "American politics is built from the bottom up in compromise. The system that has supported American politics since independence was thus also built to work only when compromise is observed and good faith assumed by all parties. Conversely, a few bad actors can send the government into a screeching halt with filibusters and quorums.\n\nFor the President, none fit the title of \"bad actor\" better than the opposition's ardent leftists. No middle ground can be found with men who stubbornly insist on wholesale nationalizations, state-funded bribery, and other such reckless, pie-in-the-sky policies. Nevermind Judd's advice -- America's better off if these men were excluded from its politics altogether!"
 USA_gld_68_infiltrate_the_NPP_leftists_desc: "In their reckless push for relevance, the schizophrenic coalition called the NPP has taken to accepting anyone who at the very least harbors a strong antipathy for the Japanese Empire. Its leftist subfaction appends the party's already loose membership criteria with a pathological love for socialism in any of its shades; so long as one loves Marx and hates Japan, in other words, they are free to wear the gold eagle wherever they go.\n\nThis presents an opportunity for the President to exploit: By sending plainclothes to join their ranks, digging for dirt becomes as easy as attending a rally. The information they extract will have much use in his hands, whether as \"informed predictions\" or... something markedly less pleasant."
 USA_gld_68_an_anti_socialist_education_desc: "The biases and beliefs we hold to our graves coalesce in the classrooms of our youth, hardening with age. Because a nation has such a narrow window to enculture its children with a shared identity, school curricula emphasize civic education as early as grade school or their equivalent thereof.\n\nSimilar logic applies to reinforcing their worldview from certain ideologies -- a man taught to steer away from socialism's allure in his childhood is less inclined to join protests and vote for socialist-friendly politicians than one whose tryst with it began in college. Consequently, inoculating the nation's youth from socialism entails enforcing anti-socialist curricula in all levels of education. This is a mission the President is all too happy to undertake."
 USA_gld_68_a_media_firestorm_desc: "If rumors are faster than the speed of light, then the only object faster than rumors themselves are rumors fed with kompromat. Additionally, the blazing trail they leave behind is enough to engulf entire worlds with a conflagration that ends only when the last atom of oxygen is fed to the fires.\n\nUp until now, President Goldwater had seen no need to liken himself to a slash-and-burn farmer. But with the overabundance of kudzu threatening to cover all ten million of America's square miles with a thick, suffocating layer of red leaves... well, he imagines Cronkite will spend a whole day thinking of a good lede for some of the scoops Hoover's boys digged up."
 USA_gld_68_conservatism_reigns_supreme_desc: "To the glee of President Goldwater's fellow conservatives, socialism has taken a bloody beating across all fronts of American life since he began his not-so-discreet war. Their reputations tarnished, their bases starved of new blood and their ideas thoroughly discredited, the NPP's leftists and their fellow travellers have either retreated from the public sphere or left our shores for more hospitable climes.\n\nThe President's party members have celebrated his victory with triumphant speeches and extravagant dinners throughout the Beltway. Some sympathetic, if unusual, fellows from the opposition congratulated him in private -- apparently \"despite (his) traitorous heritage\" to quote one of the letters verbatim -- for conclusively dealing with one of their party's unwanted sores.\n\nHe knew better of course. Only fools with the arrogance of Hercules, but with none of his strength, would say that the socialist hydra was slain for good. The President has merely done his part, and all he can do now is hope the American people will maintain vigilance for its impending return."
 USA_gld_68_focus_on_the_yockeys_desc: "Socialism may be an old enemy of the American way, but even a conservative can admit that both ideologies agree to some extent on the value of freedom and the rights of man. These similarities make socialism familiar -- comforting even -- to many Americans, for all its faults. However they disagree on the means to achieve peace and prosperity for our people, either side's adherents can take comfort in knowing that the other will eventually be swayed to theirs because of the common goal they share.\n\nFascism, on the other hand, deifies unthinking obedience and lionizes the omnipotence of strongmen. Nowhere else can one find an ideology more anathematic to American values than the Reich's slavish adherence to the supremacy of one race over all mankind. To combat this unnatural foe, and their present sympathizers within the United States, President Goldwater was convinced to set aside its century-old blood feud with socialism for the time being."
 USA_gld_68_wiretap_yockey_desc: "Francis Parker Yockey is, to put mildly, fascism's messiah in the United States. Despite the hate -- in some cases, because of the hate -- that leaves his mouth as spittle, he has garnered himself a steadily-growing base of disaffected Americans from all walks of life, all willing to hear his proffered solutions to their many problems. Often these solutions involved the brutal acts his Nazi inspirations conduct, chief among them wanton violence and the persecution of America's sheltered oppressed.\n\nJust as mildly put is President Goldwater's antipathy for a man who would shoot him out of a principled hatred for his father's ancestry. An intern questioned if his personal spite for the beloved fascist had driven the order to ruin him with blackmail from CIA infiltrators; to that, the Arizonan simply answered with a knowing smile and a pithy about cutting a snake's head off before it can slither away."
 USA_gld_68_investigate_the_kkk_desc: "By 1960, the infamous cross-burning lynch mob had dwindled from its peak of six million in the Roaring Twenties to several thousand at best, united only by their opposition to the civil rights movement. Nevertheless, the word of Klansmen have hefty weight still in the sympathetic South, and they continue to terrorize unimpeded the lives of families throughout the Black Belt.\n\nWith rumors saying that the Imperial Wizard had professed his support for Yockey's burgeoning movement, President Goldwater now has an alibi to justify going after them in front of his advisors. All he now needs is a convincing enough excuse to lock them up for life..."
 USA_gld_68_dig_up_evidence_desc: "There must be something inherent to an extremist's mindset, President Goldwater wondered, that not only inclined them towards hypocrisy but also shielded their worldview from the dissonance it causes. The latest dispatch from Hoover's agents only confirmed his suspicions. Why else would a tablecloth parade founded in direct opposition to the evil that is respect for your black compatriots apparently enjoy their ebony as much as any hot-blooded teenager with a roaming imagination?\n\nPersonally, he couldn't care less about the smut some lynching schmuck consumes. The folks around him, on the other hand -- friends, family, Southerners, National Progressives? They probably will."
 USA_gld_68_crack_down_on_fascism_desc: "It was pitch black in the White House when the phone rang. Director Hoover's gravely voice carried through the receiver as pried-awake Barry Goldwater picked it up.\n\nHe reported that he had finished gathering every last speck of dirt on Yockey and his surprisingly wide network of donors, advisors, henchmen and advocates. The good Director likened the experience to opening a matryoshka doll: Opening one reveals another, and another, and another, all the way to Washington, D.C. and the party leadership. With the big names his agents had dug out, and the debauchery they'd kept far away from the public's noses, an anonymous midnight leak into the Beltway's press corps will tear a third of the NPP apart the following morning.\n\nThe bleary-eyed President approved Director Hoover's innocuous suggestion before he went back to sleep.

How they hobbled into Congress with dishevelled hair and bloodshot eyes, making like cornered hyenas whenever their fellow critter passed by; how they delivered yesterday's stump speeches with sore throats and a fraction of the energy; how they sat next to one another as if they were bunkmates with Satan himself... the debacle that had played itself out in the days and weeks after was what he'd asked for and more.\n\nAlmost fittingly, Yockey was nowhere to be found. So much for a man who thought himself an American Hitler -- son of a Jew nipped his little putsch in the bud, imagine that! The irony was thick as buttermilk, and just as sweet.\n\nBut the cherry on top was a nondescript letter from one Gus Hall. Goldwater swore he could hear grumbling from the neat cursive that offered the communist's congratulations and thanks.\n\nAll told, America's true loyalties reasserted themselves as soon as its fascist malcontents began cannibalizing one another to irrelevance. No friend to the Reich's poisoned honey indeed."

Resultingly, some sense of common decency and good faith had returned to the debates in Capitol Hill -- minuscule compared to the genteel of pre-Depression Beltway politics, but present nevertheless. It was fair to say that, despite the rhetoric bandied about, Congress was the friendliest these last few days than it had been in twenty years.\n\nGreat men often tell of the long nights and sleep-tossing agony before and after making a hard choice.

America's faith in its noble ideals, forever tarnished by the scandals many had thought are beneath the hallowed office of presidency.\n\n[USA.GetLeader] now takes his place, immediately burdened with the ashes Wallace had left behind in his dogged quest to burn America down.

In or against its pursuit America had been laid to its lowest point a century ago; not a few days ago, America teetered dangerously close to a deeper nadir, stopped only by quick action.\n\nAmerica has had enough. The people have had enough. Blood shall be spilled no longer. Peace shall be restored, ancient enmities resolved, bonds of brotherhood reforged. One way or another, civil rights must be resolved now, lest brother fight brother once more."

By calming them down with token concessions in civil rights, the President will remove a major source of concern for American conservatives, in turn making them more amenable to cooperation."

After having been proven right, they both celebrated his downfall and loudly reminded everyone that they were right.\n\nThe President agrees with them with Wallace and other things besides -- but now is not an appropriate time to act smug. Such behavior will eat away at the slivers of unity the government has left; yet if they break away, then the hope of a functioning Congress will soon follow. For the time being, the President will reproach the progressives and their allies in private, and ask them to desist until we get things in better order."

The heavy tension that had undergirded sessions after Wallace's impeachment has faded away, now replaced by the familiar vitriol exchanged by adversaries on a regular basis. Barbs may now flow freely in Capitol Hill, but no longer do Congressmen spend hours worrying over gridlock instead of running the country.\n\nWhile cooler heads prevail, the President seeks to better bring both houses of Congress into order. A few more visits and promises might just be enough to achieve this before the rest of the government falls into similar dysfunction."

Thus, after months of deliberation, the President has chosen to side with the nation's progressives in their onwards march to a promising future.\n\nNot all musings went to the appeal of righting past injustices, however. Just as much effort was spent on predicting the fallout of such a move in America's conservative half. Needless to say, its displeasure -- though weakened by Wallace's self-induced damage -- will bellow loudly from atop chimneys, church steeples, and Capitol Hill's marble dome itself. Care must be taken to subdue these voices before they coalesce into a dagger aimed at our throats."

He sought to reignite the American people's passions towards a great crusade against tyrannical government, but in doing so had also inflamed the ire of those who saw past his bluster and civil veneer. He sought to advance the rights of states, but in doing so had compelled the federal government to commit many egregious violations against them. His hatred for the Black had instead became the Blacks' greatest asset. By the time his face kissed the White House's lawn, support for civil rights had reached highs unprecedented -- and he has only himself to blame.\n\nNow it is up to the new President to address the reintensified debate over civil rights. The task of bringing Congress to accord over this issue will not be easy, but neither will the President shirk from it."

After all, what well-meaning citizen won't at least feel irritation upon perusing the unconstitutional drivel marketed to cleanse the nation of an original sin? It is telling that millions of Americans still listened to Wallace's firebrand speeches at the height of his reign of terror -- in point of fact, much of the country preferred the despicable man over his equally-despicable progressive nemeses.\n\nLet not history regard Barry Goldwater as a politician devoid of principle.

He was only human, after all, and not without the preferences and inclinations present in any man. These biases, so to say, make accepting certain facts an exercise not unlike herding rabid cats.\n\nFacts such as the public's reaction to his last veto. He had expected, and did receive, the well-wishes from good Americans, yes. But overall... well, perhaps the reds held more sway than he thought.\n\nBut no matter.

America's setbacks in bettering its civil rights may be the most notable, so capturing the public's imagination and attention with its violence and rhetoric, but just as aggrieved -- yet given far less attention -- is the dismal state of its education system. Underfunded and overburdened, schools all over the country languished for years as they presided over the lowest graduation rates in decades.\n\nThe wounds may have already been dealt, the President says, but it is not too late to stymie the bleeding and restore the quality education Americans had once enjoyed."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_refunding_american_schools_desc: "Whether it was an earnest, yet short-sighted attempt to save money or an attack on notable wellsprings of government opposition, few can argue the repercussions of the Wallace administration budget cuts on education: less skilled people entering the workforce, more dropouts who can't get a job, and an unemployment rate steadily ticking upwards with every quarter. In a few years' time, Wallace had single handedly impeded America's economy from improving for years yet.\n\nThis mistake must be rectified not only for the good of the nation, but also for the good of its citizenry. Effective immediately, the President will restore funding for public schools and educational institutions back to their pre-Wallace levels."

Cleaning it up will take time, and one can never assuredly say that things will go back to the way they were before his reign of terror. Regardless, the worst of the damage is being unwound inch by gory inch.\n\nFew elsewhere does this show more than in reverting his \"reforms\" to American education. Streams of money, once dried but now restored, have slaked the thirst of schools longing for new textbooks and classrooms. Teachers and students return to their desks in droves. Like well-oiled gears sprung into motion, the great machine of academia now turns with more rust lost and old smoothness regained with every gyration.

Rather, it is a federation of fifty separate states, linked by the chains of perpetual Union through shared identity, and whose unified direction is decided by the consensus of an assembly of elected statesmen. This unique arrangement justifiably requires some form of leeway for the states subsumed into one politic to act on their own accord. In most cases, giving these states the powers they enjoy as Constitutional right is a goal worth lauding.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Wallace's own acts to \"improve\" states' rights. Put short, a man who wields the federal government like a mallet to force laws into Congress only has states rights as a tangential goal at best. We should best get to work undoing the damage he's dealt to an otherwise noble goal's repute."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_a_rat_in_sheeps_clothing_desc: "Never before has \"states' rights\" been so associated with segregation as it is today. As expected of a simpleton with little in the way of tact, Wallace never once erred from speaking of \"restoring the rights of states to choose their destiny\" in the same breath as \"keeping the equals separate\". Did he truly clamor for states' rights when he attempted to enforce segregation in the North? Or when he cut much-needed funds for public schools in the poorest of America's states?\n\nNo two ways around it: Wallace exploited the public's sympathy for the liberties of their states in order to violate these very same liberties across two-thirds of America. It will take time to untangle the mess he had left behind to local laws, but restoring faith in an integral aspect of America's political system is worth any effort."

Only through repeated exercise, and not a little guidance, can a victim perform as well as they used; in some cases, their past performance will forever be lost in the scene of the crime.\n\nRestoring the prestige of states' rights in this nation is no different. With the disrepute it had gained under Wallace's tender ministrations, only a proportionate amount of outreach and reassurances to the once-bitten American people can ever convince them to throw their weight into it again. That said, the South will surely look favorably upon someone willing to help their dearest cause at its very nadir."

The administration insists on the legality of the executive order, while citing its necessity in order to ensure America's nature is preserved. Some voices within the Republican half of the Republican-Democrats have denounced this move by the administration as authoritarian. Nevertheless, few others have protested at this measure of the administration.\n\nThe bill is a great step forward in environmental legislation. Regardless of his firm belief in laissez-faire, President Barry Goldwater has always had a special appreciation for America's natural beauty, enough that he would see it protected by the federal government. Particularly younger voters seem to agree with and appreciate the President's environmentalist tendencies, making it likely that he is to enjoy a small surge in support among this demographic.\n\nWith the bill, the President's bill has created a new federal agency: the EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA will be made responsible for ensuring that all of America's nature will be preserved and not subjected to needless and excessive pollution, through helping develop and enforce environmental regulation in cooperation with Congress.\n\nThe President can rest a little easier knowing that America's beauty is preserved for the next generation."

It was a surprise to many when Goldwater asked Judd to be his running mate on the 1968 ticket. Many assumed that Goldwater would have sought a more malleable, meek man to serve as Vice President than the very outspoken Judd, who represented the \"Eastern Establishment\" that Goldwater rallied against during the entire primary season. Someone that could accept being second fiddle, little more than someone to bolster the demographics needed to win the election.\n\nOf course, Goldwater would never come out to say such a thing publically, even if it was true.\n\n\"I'm currently assembling my cabinet.

The Treasury Secretary stood in front of the desk, shaking his head. \"The first thing I did was get my staff to create this, with a brief description of each program the federal government runs, so we can figure out what we can get rid of.\"\n\nGoldwater flipped the page to the first program, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the AAA, and quickly read the description. \"Pay farmers to not plant some of their land, and sell excess livestock to the government?\" He frowned, grabbed the page, and with a satisfying rip, tore it from the binder. \"That's the first one to go.\"\n\nThe President stuck his finger part way into the pages, and flipped the binder there. The Works Progress Administration, WPA. \"Provide contracts to companies to hire unemployed workers to build parks, post offices and other public infrastructure.

If someone wants to buy their art, then they should make it worth being sold.\"\n\nGoldwater turned to the last program, the Veterans Pension Act of 1947. \"Provide a pension to all members of the US Armed Forces who served in the Second World War,\" Goldwater read. He looked at it for a long moment, before grabbing a pen. \"Getting rid of all the pensions would be a terrible move. But if a former soldier is healthy, fit, and working, I don't think he needs an extra hundred bucks a month.\" \"I agree, Mr. President,\" Secretary Regan said, a grin on his face. \"I've already marked about a third of the programs that we can get rid of without too much fuss.

So catchy names and programs with a word-scramble of acronyms were created. The SSA, the WPA, the AAA, the FRA, NIRA and several dozen more. Slogans like \"The New Deal,\" \"the Fair Deal,\" and more have been bandied about for just as long. Every single one a further burden on the taxpayer, all of them a further expansion of the government.\n\nBarry Goldwater is going to be different. Instead of making the government fatter, he is imposing a strict diet. Gone will be all the silly letters. The bloated budget will be slimmed down. By the end of his administration, the US Federal Government will be a sleeker, slimmer, and more effective government, doing what governments do best: maintain an army, negotiate with other countries, and stay the hell away from ordinary Americans.\n\nThe problem is that a lot of ordinary Americans have been brainwashed for two generations, told that the government will always help them when they need it. Did you lose your job? Here's a cheque! Did you retire without saving up enough? Here's a cheque! Is your farm or business underwater because you made some bad decisions? Don't you worry, because here's a cheque! The problem is those cheques add up, and add up fast. Now the US is in debt and in crisis.\n\nThirty years of coddling, consoling, instead of toughening and strengthening. Americans now hurt themselves, and cry to the government to help them. But no more. It's time for some tough love. In order to save America, Goldwater is going to have to make some tough choices. Unpopular choices. Choices that others, like the lily-livered Democrats or the Fascist-Communist NPP are loathe to make. But he's ready to do that. Anything to save America from itself."

It finally culminated in a massive, nationwide \"March Against Welfare Cuts\" that filled every city, from the metropolises of New York and Los Angeles, to the smaller cities like Boise and Akron, and everywhere in between.\n\nThe leaders of the strikes were, as to be expected, from the National Progressive Pact, the opposition.

The supporters of Yockey's branch of the NPP were also out in force, though they were more focused on the \"clearly Jewish conspiracy\" of Goldwater rather than particular care for those that would be impacted.\n\nBut even the Nationalists, notably segregationist and conservative, were standing up against Goldwater's proposals, as their Southern supporters would be drastically affected by the cuts to farm subsidies, health programs and old-age assistance.\n\nHence the picture, taken in Atlanta on that fine day: the sight of Nationalist leader and avowed segregationist George Wallace, standing arm in arm with African-American Progressive supporters, together holding a banner saying: \"Goldwater = Gold for the Rich, Water for the Poor.\""

In fact, they were tough, brutal, and sometimes deadly. But if you worked hard, if you worked smart, you could reach a higher station in life than any that could have been imagined back in The Old World.

This was possible when every man could work.\"\n\n\"But now, with all the regulations and conditions of a nanny state, Americans' have lost the will, the ability, the right even to work.\"\n\n\"So you may ask why my administration is undertaking the Herculean task of reforming our welfare. For one very simple reason: 'Working Men Should Work!'\"\n\nThe applause for the President's speech at a rally in Chicago was intense, the cheering nearly muting the audio on the TV.

But the President is also keenly aware that he will need help from the more liberal Democrats within the coalition in order to pass such a budget, and compromises will have to be reached. In fact, the proposed cuts that are coming out now seem to actually be rather moderate, and more technical than anything. Few programs are being shut down, while others will be merged to realize efficiencies in administration and the bureaucracy, which usually is the largest expense anyway in these kinds of assistance programs. Some funding for grants to states on health, education, food and shelter assistance and more is also being reduced, and more requirements are being put in place to ensure that only those that actually need it are receiving the funds.\n\nIn general, no one is happy with the budget, but few are really angry over it either: Republicans are displeased that the spending cuts aren't even more drastic, while Democrats are disappointed that funding for some benefits that they consider worthwhile and important has been reduced. The NPP is on both extremes: demanding more social spending, or demanding the whole system of Social Security and Medicare and more be totally demolished. So Goldwater can rest easy in that, with everyone not getting what they want, but not totally losing everything either, that must mean he made a compromise that will pass Congress."

And by god, Goldwater and the Republicans are going to take advantage of it. There will be no compromises, no mercy. The proposed cuts that are coming out are extreme. Many programs are being shut down, and those that are surviving will have their administration costs severely curtailed, which will result in a lot of unemployed bureaucrats. Funding for grants to states on health, education, food and shelter assistance and more is being slashed to barely anything, and vastly greater requirements are being put in place to ensure that only those that actually need it are receiving the funds.\n\nIn general, only the Republicans can be happy with the budget, but few are really angry over it either: Republicans are generally pleased that government spending is going to be massively curtailed, while Democrats are furious that funding for many of the programs and benefits that they consider worthwhile and important has been erased. The Marxists are riotous, and even the Nationalist Caucus is rather hesitant to actually support such drastic measures.

 GLD.20.t: "모턴과의 만남"
 GLD.20.desc: "The interesting thing about Thruston Ballard Morton, Goldwater mused to himself, was that he was such a profoundly uninteresting-looking man. If you combined the faces of all the members of Congress into one man, the result would probably look quite similar to him. Clean-cut, short hair, square face. It was hard to imagine such a non-descriptive man could wield such power - yet, here he was, facing the President down in the Oval Office.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" he began politely, \"it's the opinion of myself and my friends that Mr. Regan has gotten a little carried away with his plans.\" Goldwater's head cocked to the side, light glinting off the lenses of his glasses. \"His heart is in the right place, of course, but he's taking it... well too far with these tax and welfare cuts. Some of what he's pushing for is economic nonsense.\"\n\n\"I chose him for his role because I agree with much of that so-called nonsense, Morton.\" Goldwater responded. \"Frankly, I don't think it's nonsense at all.\"\n\n\"You may not, Mr. President, but the party doesn't agree. A lot of people are worried. I can't guarantee his ideas make it through the Senate.\" Morton replied, settling in his chair as he lined up his main attack. \"Now, I think there's more than enough room between us to compromise, especially on trade and the national debt. We work out a deal there, and I guarantee that whatever bill we put out passes. You have my word.\"\n\nGoldwater considered the offer for a moment - Morton was not speaking emptily. A fair number of moderates in the RDC would be sure to follow what he did. Approaching it pragmatically, he made his choice. \"Alright, you have your deal. I hope you're ready to explain to my voters why I'm going back on my words.\""

 GLD.21.desc: "For the past seventy years, the American economy grew by leaps and bounds. We did so by embracing ideas and technology that older powers, content with their empires and wealth, ignored or disdained. But we were never daunted by distance or space, by lack of expertise or technical knowhow. We forged our way across a continent, united Pacific and Atlantic with ribbons of steel, filled a land with settlers with the masses driven from their homelands. We embraced electricity, the assembly line, the telephone, the automobile, the radio, the airplane and most recently, the television.\n\nMost of these inventions were developed or created, or refined and perfected, here within the United States. But to achieve these great feats, to the point where we've made more steel than both Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire combined, and built an economy and nation far richer than any in the world had seen before, we isolated ourselves. Tariffs were high, and trade limited. We shunned the outside world, and in turn, they shunned us. We contented ourselves with making our cars, our washing machines, our televisions, and selling them to ourselves. Sure, some would be exported to Canada, some to Mexico. But never in huge numbers, and only limited ways.\n\nBut tariffs and trade barriers is a mark of one of two kinds of economies: a young, struggling one, seeking to carve out their place in the world in the face of international competition. Or it's the sign of a degenerate and fearful people. Corrupt leaders and greedy businessmen who content themselves to grow fat off a people that are hostage to an economy of overpriced and underperforming goods, monopolies that seek only to further their own wealth and power by sucking it from their nation, instead of challenging the world, seeking new markets, offering good quality and service for a fair price.\n\nWe are no longer a weak and struggling country, so that excuse has no holding. But are we a nation of cartels and monopolies? Are we willing to just lounge and laze in decadence, letting our standards slip and prices rise? I say no. America can compete with anyone in the world. If someone can do something better, we should learn from it. We should be willing to embrace trade with the whole world, with no limits or restrictions. Now is the time for America to embrace free trade."

Are you willing to spend money on products made in prison camps? I think the answer is clear.\"\n\nUnfortunately like much of American politics, the answer is never so black and white. While embargos with the German Reich, the Italian Empire, and the Empire of Japan have been in place since the end of the war, they have steadily loosened and opened up in time: American TVs travel across the ocean for German beer, Japanese cars, or Italian wine. After all, with two-thirds of the world, and nearly half of the population of the globe under their sway, totally cutting links with the fascist and ultra-nationalist powers of the world would be like cutting off your arm. At least many of the big businessmen, many of them on the more right wing side of the Republicans, are oft to say such.\n\nBut there has always been an uneasiness, a disgust, with trading with such nations. Such goods are not readily available, usually for the simple reason that no one wants them. To drive a Mercedes is to mark you out as a German sympathizer, maybe even a supporter of Yockey's madness. To buy a Mitsubishi car shows that the thousands that died in the Pacific were in vain, to value foreignness and efficiency over patriotism and love of country.\n\nGoldwater, as the valiant anti-fascist he is, tapped into that sentiment in a big way. To him, \"Free Trade\" means more than low tariffs and few restrictions: it means trading with democracies, with nations that value freedom and liberty over totalitarianism and iron fisted rule. Many of the leading Republicans, businessmen serving their nation in Congress for a period before returning back to their family business or the big corporations, are horrified at this \"Goldwater Way.\" Some have even come out and said so. But the public reaction is overwhelmingly in favor of Goldwater's idea of \"Free Trade.\" It's even seen as a courageous act by an otherwise loyal Republicans, to stand up to the wealthy elites, to stand up for what he thinks, what he knows, is right."

After all, nations like Australia and South Africa, with smaller economies and businesses, would have to face off American behemoths like Ford, Standard Oil, and Boeing. With vast resources, skills and labour, the US conglomerates could quickly monopolize these new markets, undercutting their competition and driving the smaller, local companies out of business altogether. But at the same time, the thought of Australian Holden cars or Canadian Avro planes being sold into one of the largest markets in the world with little in the way of tariffs is also deeply appealing.\n\nBut once we are all together, with the diplomatic niceties of being greeted by an honor guard of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a delicious dinner of wild-caught salmon in their bellies, the real work of international affairs can begin.

There are three paths forward, as far as Goldwater can tell. The first, and most simple, is to keep the Organization of Free Nations as a simple military alliance, focused on the external fascist threat from Europe, Asia, and Africa. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the more hawkish advisors are in favor of this course of action, to keep America and her allies focused on the true threat.\n\nAnother group, lead by the Secretary of State and those seeking to push diplomacy, seek to use the OFN as a force to encourage free trade around the world, especially with nations that may not be the most democratic or open, but are still important geo-political partners to the US. By convincing these nations to open their economies to the OFN, they will be tied even more directly to America, and those levers can be used in the future.\n\nThe final group, promoted by the Secretary of Commerce and business leaders, seek to make the OFN more than a military alliance, and even more than just to push for free trade around the world, but as the establishment of an entire economic bloc. Reducing tariffs, cutting regulations, and establishing common standards, all to push for more economic ties between the various nations, making everyone richer in the process.\n\nThe decision has been made, and now it's time for Goldwater to make the announcement.\n\n\"I've gathered you here today to discuss...\""

In order to achieve this, and to strengthen the OFN, streamlining of equipment such as rifles and ammo, as well as standardizing training, communications and more.\n\n\"The war against freedom is a war against America and the OFN,\" President Goldwater stated in his speech. \"America should not flag nor fail to protect not just our friends and allies, but anyone who seeks to free themselves from the Nazi yoke, or the Imperial chains.\"\n\nPublic response has been mixed so far. In some countries, the thought of sending their young men to poke at the fascist bear by aiding resistance groups has caused anti-OFN protests, while supporters of liberty and freedom have marched in support. Some countries also have anonymously expressed concern that America will have way too much power, being the largest military in the OFN, and could be using the smaller nations as cannon fodder for their own goals, or worse, stripping away historical traditions in the military in favour of American ones. But closer ties within the alliance, and strengthening everyone's economies in turn, may in turn make the whole stronger.

However, the bill passed with the majority support from the RDC and the more moderate members of the NPP, as it was fairly non-controversial in the halls of power. Outside Washington, though, some commentators have expressed reservations about the financial cost of removing tariffs, and some have talked about the impact on good paying American jobs in comparison to cheaper labour elsewhere in the OFN. There are also concerns over the unilateral action that is not being reciprocated by other OFN members immediately, over all the opinion on the bill is seen as a net positive for the US.\n\nWith the bill now on it's way to be signed by the President, soon the vast majority of tariffs will be erased from the law books, allowing products from all over the OFN to be sold in America without the artificial price increased by taxing imports. This will be a victory for everyone: the price of raw materials, oil, consumer goods, and more from nations like Canada, Australia, and South Africa will be cheaper for US companies and consumers, while giving an economic boost to America's friends and allies."

The unilateral effort to remove trade barriers was supposed to make trade between America and her allies cheaper and more expedient, which would have benefited all sides, or so Goldwater and the RDC have claimed.\n\nThe Marxist faction was opposed from the get go, as they claimed the bill would pulverize the American economy, and more importantly, the American worker. By allowing products from nations with lower labor costs, it could see many highly-paid workers lose their jobs, which would cause ripple effects throughout the nation. The Yockey branch of the NPP was even more vitriolic in their denunciations of the Free Trade Act, considering it little more than a tool to drag America into the morass of global politics, and damage their \"America First\" ideals.\n\nHowever, the impact could be even worse on President Goldwater than a failed bill to lower some tariffs: with the extremes of the NPP now holding the balance of power in the Senate, that can only mean one of two things: either Goldwater is going to have to compromise to get anything done, or he's already been rendered a lame-duck President.

However, concerns regarding the removal of tariffs, the dismantling of import quotas, the harmonization of regulations and the extension of copyright protections need to be addressed in the NATC negotiations. Labor unions in Canada and the US are afraid that big businesses will seek to lower costs by building factories in the cheaper and less unionized Mexico, while farmers in Canada and Mexico are afraid of being overwhelmed by American food without the import quotas they currently have, or Hollywood and American TV networks destroying her neighbor's cultural institutions. And of course, nationalist forces in all three countries are reluctant, if not downright hostile, to the idea of making all three countries more open, facilitating immigration, culture and trade. Mexican's especially believe that the NATC is just a way to get their nation to join the American lead Organization of Free Nations alliance, which would end their decades of neutrality.\n\nAll these problems, and many more, will have to be overcome if the NATC is to be put in place.

Some call it Libertarian, some call it Fiscal Conservatism. Barry Goldwater calls it Common Sense.\n\nEver since the Great Depression, Washington has steadily gained more and more power.

Then with the war and the mobilization for it, came inspectors, support for unions, restrictions, rationing of resources, all called temporary, all to win the war.\n\nBut even the war ended in humiliation and defeat, the technocratic, heavy handed bureaucrats and their stalwart allies in Congress doubled down, clinging to their offices and positions, throwing more and more money at every problem. But this only bloated every element of government, ballooned an already astronomical debt.

He reflected on the obstacles he had skirted around or smashed through to bring the EPA into being. The corrupt lobbyists he had to silence, the local governments who needed to be brought into line, the difficulty of getting the details right with his advisors, and finally the bloody path he'd had to carve through Congress just to get them to read the bill.

Unfortunately, there was a price: major concessions to the same polluting industries that the EPA was being established to regulate. It was, in effect, a blunting of the teeth. A domestication, intended to hobble the EPA and prevent it from tackling the big dogs. Sure, it'd do some good, but the richest and thus most powerful offenders would get away virtually scot-free, with only a slap on the wrist for the future crimes against the environment they were sure to commit if McNamara's proposal shaped the EPA instead of his.\n\nGoldwater's pen hovered over the dotted line.

Of course, he'd need to find a way to actually, you know, pay for it, but that was something he could deal with later.\n\nFor now, filled with the lightness of being that comes with accomplishing a long-held goal, Goldwater rose and made a mental note to have every available newspaper praising his speech delivered to him as he made his way with his entourage back to Cadillac One."

Lobbying is one thing, outright bribery is quite another.\n\nDriven by that ball of cold fury that burned within him, Goldwater decided to push the big red button and call out the corrupters and their lackeys who were so willing to undermine America's democratic traditions to continue unabated their plunder of the environment.

He'd spoken to his advisors the previous day: Judd strongly supported it, Regan disapproved, insisting it would be a waste of government funds, and McNamara and Curtis were relatively blase and disinterested. Nevertheless, they'd thrown around a lot of ideas, some of which, to the President's surprise, were even half-decent. After waking up, he had immediately started working on a plan of what the EPA should look like.\n\nAnd, goddamn it all, he was nowhere closer to figuring it out than he had been yesterday! Through exhausted eyes, Goldwater once again looked over his work so far, trying to make it all come together in his mind. The EPA couldn't be too radical, but it couldn't be limp-wristed either or he might as well just not create it. It needed teeth, but it shouldn't be so powerful as to completely alienate the world of business and their 'friends' in Congress. And, of course, there was the small matter of how exactly the EPA would be funded, meaning which program would have its budget drained to bankroll it.\n\nThe President rested his chin on his hand. So many problems, all requiring decisions. He couldn't let himself forget that what he was doing here was important, that it would change the lives of Americans for decades to come. Picking up the phone, Goldwater decided to arrange for a press conference to announce that the Environmental Protection Agency was more than just a dream, that he was serious about preserving America's natural beauty for their descendants.\n\nSurely nobody could begrudge him if he left the details until later.

Why do these fat, balding old men never get suspicious when centerfold girls half their age suddenly find them impossibly alluring?\n\nSupposing he shouldn't complain as it made his job a hell of a lot easier, he got to work.

Effort has been made to assemble a concise yet thorough briefing on the group. Further materials are available at your request.\n\nThe Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, to use their full appellation, represent America's foremost domestic threat, in the view of the Bureau. The KKK and its predecessors have been monitored and actively engaged by the Bureau since the late 1910s. Around 1920, Klan activity became far more bold, corresponding with an explosion in membership. Despite the Klan's ostensible support for law and order, they have actively menaced both the Bureau and any state or federal authorities who oppose them. Even so, the Klan has been consistently protected for decades by corrupt and/or segregationist state governments and courts, as well as many state police forces - overwhelmingly in the South, naturally. KKK membership within all three of these institutions is common throughout the former Confederate states, while minor branches exist in most other states.\n\nThe KKK should not be misunderstood as merely a pro-segregation activist group, Mr. President. They are a genuine threat to American citizens of all colors and creeds, so long as those citizens are not both white and aligned with their cause. Both ordinary crime - mostly violent in nature - and outright terrorism are standard practice for the group. Naturally, their main targets are civil rights activists and institutions which support them. You will recall the bombing of Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama - that was the Klan's work, though we still lack sufficient evidence to prosecute our suspects. That was only one of many similar attacks, which range from bombing to arson and murder.\n\nThe Director agrees that the KKK poses a serious threat to domestic stability and the lives of our citizens, and must be dealt with decisively as soon as possible."

After worming his way into Yockey's circle, an agent had reported to Quantico that Yockey always had with him a suitcase filled with forged passports with false identities; Mexican, Swedish, Australian, no doubt as insurance should he ever be forced to flee the country. Ironically, his attempt to escape the law had attracted them to him like a moth to a light. Before the day ended, Crandall would see the Nazi bastard in cuffs.\n\nCrandall and his boys marched across the Sheraton's opulent lobby, making no effort to wipe their feet. He flashed his badge at an irate desk clerk, and, without breaking his stride, flung open the doors to the convention hall where Yockey and his coterie were supposed to be hosting a fundraising event.\n\nInstantly he felt something was wrong. A hundred faces turned to him, but none of them were Yockey's. Gorge rising, his eyes groped for the sign proclaiming the name of the event: Christian Mothers for Teenage Abstinence.

To this I answer: with what men and on whose dime? If even you and I know how costly running a large peacetime army can be, imagine the things a HBS graduate should know better than us but won't!\"\n\nDespite having acquired President Goldwater's ear, Donald Rumsfeld has intensified his feud with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara over the administration's planned military reforms by publicly insulting his proposals in a Washington function. Several Republican-Democrat Congressmen attending the event were seen voicing approval of the Rumsfeld's long-winded heckling of the \"McNamara Plan\", ostensibly including inappropriate insinuations of the eponymous man's intellect and moral character.\n\nNeither President Goldwater nor Secretary McNamara have issued statements regarding the incident thus far."

Does the nation have a mighty army, capable of defending its borders when war is thrust upon it, or being able to expand through might and power? The United States of the present time is, indeed, a strong, powerful nation, with an arsenal of weapons that could obliterate the world many times over.\"\n\n\"Second: Is it a rich and prosperous nation? Does the nation have the economy and resources, the technology and know-how to use what they have been blessed with in their land and people? The United States of the present time is, very much so, a rich and prosperous nation, with food and steel and consumer goods in excessive abundance.\"\n\n\"Third: Is it a just and moral nation? Does the nation, with it's great army and rich economy, use both to help all the citizens of their nation, and not just a small elite, either of power or a certain religion or race or class? Or does it enslave, brutalize, suppress and impoverish?\"\n\n\"And here, I say that the United States of the present time does not fulfill its duty to its people.\"\n\nMichael Harrington, writer, radio commentator, professor of Political Science, a leader of the National Progressive Pact, and former candidate for President of the US, has given a blistering speech at a rally in Chicago that has been broadcast around the nation. Without once mentioning Goldwater's name, Harrington has picked apart, piece by piece, the whole domestic policy of the President, focusing especially on the budget cuts to welfare programs.\n\nWhile Goldwater has been attacked and criticized by many others for these same plans time and time again, they were barely pinpricks to the President. But with Harrington, it could make or break everything, a full body-blow that could torpedo Goldwater's reform plans."

The recent speech by NPP leader Michael Harrington has set Washington ablaze with questions about how the President would respond. Today, the President replied, and offered a cool-headed and reasonable response.\n\n\"I understand that many of the programs that are currently being examined have become very important for many people who have disabilities, were injured, recently unemployed, and are currently down on their luck,\" Mr. Goldwater said. \"And I will assure them that the proposed budget will still make it possible for those that absolutely need the social safety net will receive it.\"\n\n\"Our biggest focus is trying to ensure that federal finances will be sustainable for the long term. This means that some cuts will have to be made, and revenue increased. Welfare and tax reform will go a long way to solving both issues.\"\n\nThe President spent over half an hour answering questions that the reporters asked regarding costs, who would still qualify, and how the cuts will be implemented over the next few years. While there are many who are disappointed in the cuts, especially in the Democratic faction of the RDC and members of the NPP Progressive Caucus, early reports from pollsters indicate that many swing voters have been convinced by the President's speech. Mr. Goldwater's approval has already increased, and some analysts believe that his 1972 re-election campaign will benefit greatly from the President's speech."

Sometimes that involves a little tough love,\" the President continued. \"If you want a nice house, a nice car, and not be a burden to society, then get off your butt and go find a job!\"\n\nThe President cut the question section short after that, storming out of the press room. The unprofessional and rage-filled question session was compared by some who witnessed it to a nuclear bomb going off, an angry Mr. Goldwater sounded more like a disjointed and incoherent rambling letter to the editor in a newspaper. Early reports from pollsters indicate that many swing voters have been turned off by the President's speech, and a surge in approval for the National Progressive Pact, especially the center and left factions.

I'm Walter Cronkite.\n\nWashington, D.C. is in turmoil and shock today with the presentation of President Goldwater's proposed budget to Congress. In a stunning move, many Senators from the President's own party stood up and left the Senate Chamber soon after the debate began on the budget.\n\nThe Democrats have been vocally opposed to the President's language and actions in the past few weeks in attempting to cut spending, especially on welfare programs. However, many senators are saying that it was even worse than they thought once they got the chance to read the budget, which led to the Democrat Walkout today.\n\n\"It is perfectly clear now who the President is supporting,\" one senator said to reporters as he left the Capitol Building. \"And it isn't the average American, or those in dire need of help and assistance. All Goldwater is helping is arch-conservative allies, who want to run roughshod over the poor and struggling.\"\n\n\"This isn't simply balancing the budget,\" another Senator remarked. \"This is an outright declaration of war on the poor, the colored, and disabled. How can we even consider such a proposal without looking at the blood on our hands?\"\n\nRepublicans have long supported cutting such spending, seeing it as wasteful, ineffective, leading to a larger government and reducing the liberty, freedom and work ethics of the American worker.\n\nThis may be a huge blow to President Goldwater. The Republican-Democrat Coalition, working together since the end of the World War, now seems to be on the verge of collapse, with the Republican faction of the alliance gaining ascendance. But it remains to be seen if the budget that the President proposed will actually pass Congress."

However, many Americans are not going to immediately exchange their bills for gold coins, but there is a confidence amongst everyone that if they want to, they can.\n\nWith the confidence of gold backing up the US dollars, and the measures we put in place to keep prices stable and reasonable, we should soon be seeing inflation level off and businesses profits increase.

Not only that, but our efforts to set price limits on goods to prevent inflation has also backfired: most of the goods we sought to restrict are now being sold for much more than we decreed, and many stores are being overwhelmed as panicked shoppers try to stock up on everything from canned foods to toilet paper.\n\nNeedless to say, this has been perhaps the worst thing to happen to our economy since the Great Depression. Already many businesses are facing a credit crunch, and layoffs are soon to be widespread. Republican-Democrats in Washington are unable to work together, with liberals blaming conservatives for their misguided actions, and conservatives are accusing liberals of sabotage.

Many assumed that Goldwater would have sought a more malleable, meek man to serve as Vice President than the very outspoken Judd, who represented the \"Eastern Establishment\" that Goldwater rallied against during the entire primary season.

On the Governor's order, the FBI was stood down and the perpetrators were engaged by riot police. By 8:45 PM, police had breached the house and killed all four perpetrators, all confirmed to be white males aged 22-38. They also took one unarmed white female into custody. Upon investigation of documents recovered at the scene, the perpetrators have been identified as members of a fringe-right terrorist group comprised of former followers of fascist criminal Francis Yockey. Though it may sound incredible, according to their records, the group, calling themselves Avengers for America, were formulating a plan to assassinate the Hollywood actress and outspoken left-wing activist Jane Fonda for her connection to the Black Panther Party on an upcoming film shoot in Maryland.

Surprisingly, the all-American corn-fed football-playing beer drinking Maryland cop turned out to be as red as cherry pie due to his upbringing, raised in an odd socialist commune by a pair of avowed leftists.\n\nThanks to Tarrant recently becoming a household name, his public endorsement of Hall has had the same effect for the usually obscure leftist faction of the NPP, catapulting them and Hall to the forefront of the public's attention. To Goldwater's consternation, he'd already heard whispers about Hall using the momentum from Tarrant's endorsement to even further increase the relevance of the Far Left NPP.\n\nIrritating that a single nobody could have this much impact, thought the President. If it wasn't for that photographer being in the right place at the right time, Tarrant would still be just another Joe Schlub and Hall would still be an obscure nobody.

Several days have passed since the inauguration of America's most recent President. Barry Goldwater gathered his notes together and faced the restless crowd as he began one of his first speeches as President of the United States. Today's speech consisted of his plan to improve the economy, invest in the defenses of the OFN, and handle America's foreign policy. However, as the former Arizona senator dragged on, his words began to target specific parties in the United States.\n\n\"I've encountered plenty of 'bad apples' in the political system of our country, but I have never seen a party more destructive to our way of life than the Marxists. You can't find a good politician in the group, they're all bad! And they want to introduce harsh civil rights policies that would change the country all too quickly! These guys preach the nationalization of every business in America, obviously they want to crack down on individuality! They even want to expand welfare far beyond what we're capable of right now! I don't believe a single 'true' American would support their policies!\"\n\nOnce the President finished his speech and began the trip back to Washington, he received a phone call from his Vice President Walter Judd. \"Barry, did you not hear yourself up there?!\" the VP exclaimed, \"I hope you remembered that our allies is advocating for the same principles you just denounced. Not only are you slinging mud on your own party for no reason, but you were targeting your fellow Americans today. I encourage you to think harder before you make another move against the Democrats, whether intentionally or unintentionally.\""

Congressman Miller is addressing the rally, enunciating every word to make his speech sound both judicious and vital. The crowd claps gamely, although everyone knows that William E.

 GLD.union.1.desc: "For much of his near-sixty years of life, President Barry Goldwater had maintained one routine without ever skipping a day. At around six in the morning he would wake up, make for the kitchen, and prepare himself a cup of coffee. Larger, more staffed and more stocked his new DC abode may be -- but the ingredients and proportions in use hadn't changed from his shack in Paradise Valley.\n\nThe Arizonan's recipe of choice was simple: Two sugar, one cream, no milk, five ounces of water -- just enough to keep the slightly sweet taste potent. He wouldn't trade it for any other mix in the world. If someone else prefers their coffee with more or less sugar and creamer then that was fine too. Any self-respecting man would tailor their coffee to their own unique tastes instead of letting someone else decide the flavor for them.\n\nBarry smiled to himself. It seemed fitting that centuries-old, future-proof wisdoms can be gleaned through the simple act of preparing Earth's black blood. But what did it say when half the country still acted as if they only drank instant coffee their whole lives? That wouldn't do at all.\n\nAs he stirred his mug with a teaspoon, Barry thought of the future. The country has no shortage of troublemakers who'd love nothing more than to herd the American people along like unthinking sheep. Strays from the flock, dreaming of the freedom they deserve, would be brought back by gentle-looking hands to await the inevitable slaughter. Plenty of those in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, banners red like the blood of lambs. In his weaker moments the desire to fight evil with a lesser evil grows strong... but it was far too early to make such a drastic decision.\n\nAmerica's new President took his first sip for the morning. He promised every American would have the chance to brew their own coffee. Can't do that without starting the day right, now can he?"

Barry suspected that these deals had become far too commonplace for the Midwest's politicians to garner their concern. The statesmen of Congress are no less vulnerable to pecuniary concerns than the working man, after all -- what was a little quid-pro-quo with the local union for some pocket change?\n\nNaturally, any man of principle would feel incensed at such blatant corruption. The Arizonan himself was reminded too much of New York and old Tammany Hall -- a well-oiled machine of bribes, favors and ballot boxes -- for comfort.\n\nAnd so it was that he said just as much to Don in a private lunch, to which the Secretary of the Treasury replied shruggingly:"

At best it's a questionable, dubious attempt to hold the nation's labor leaders accountable. At worst...\"\n\nThe Vice President held a glare at his colleague. \"It's a blatant smear job,\" he said sotto voce.\n\nRed-faced, Secretary Regan began to burst a reply-\n\n\"Gentlemen.\"\n\n-were it not for President Barry Goldwater's sharp rebuke.

He let it linger on his Vice President a fraction of a moment more. \"Need I remind you both again to settle your differences like adults, and not like schoolchildren?\"\n\nChastised, Regan returned to skimming the portfolio with a grimace.

Up until now he said nothing, only scanning the names and details on the briefing like a hawk appraising helpless worms writhing above ground.

With a breath he edged closer to the microphone and said, \"Unfortunately, I am not at liberty to release the details of an ongoing federal investigation. But know this: Corruption undermines both the integrity of the government's laws and its people's trust therein.\"\n\nHe soothed his parched throat with a gulp of bottled water. \"If these... frauds, as Director Hoover describes them,\" the President continued, \"were proven to have used their subordinates' money to enrich themselves and their political allies, rather than to better their workers' lot, then I will not hesitate to wield all the implements the Constitution has bestowed upon my office to see these men answer to the Blind Lady in court.\"\n\nA nod from the journalist as she sat down. \"Thank you, Mister President.\""

Companies, friendships, even governments aren't immune to this ugly manifestation of human nature -- Barry needed to glance only once at the muck and grime in Capitol Hill he'd seen since his tenure as Senator to impress that immutable fact into his head.\n\nLabor unions are no different, else why would so many millions flock under their cogs and hammers and sickles? Their playbook is a masterstroke in both its simplicity and its grasp of men's inner machinations: Workers join a union and get all these wonderful benefits, but not before coughing up their cash every now and then and pledging their fealty. Just like that, John Doe gets conned out of both his savings and his free will, tempted by the money to hedge their bets on collective fraud disguised as the highway to a wonderful career. For the rudely awakened... Well, peer pressure and the threat of exile do just fine keeping these comrades in line. Meanwhile, their bosses are free to do whatever they will with countless millions in ill-gotten paychecks. Despicable and abhorrent, but successful all the same.\n\nThis time the roast on Barry's mug was strong and potent, scalding, bitter. It roiled and burbled on his tongue as he read one of several thousand tragedies the White House's mailbox had received since he announced his war on union corruption. After reaching the last dot, he tossed the letter aside and scratched another missive to Director Hoover.\n\nSomething had to be done before these duplicitous \"vanguards of workers' rights\" swindle another hardworking American.

So-called \"scabs\" have no place with the boys, after all; more importantly, bosses love to see their numbers grow.\n\nWhat happened afterwards resembled more of a protection racket than a confraternity of workers. Aforementioned benefits were \"delayed\" due to supposed problems with their employer, all while payments were leaving their owners for their boss's pockets. The unions stifled all attempts to speak out against such cases of unfair treatment, either with community conformity or with brute thugs masquerading as their \"comrades\" glowering behind every eye corner.\n\nLeft with no other recourse, these men took the federal government's hand, no matter how questionable its presence, if it meant the chance to sterilize these reservoirs of corruption from top to bottom..."

Its title succinctly summarized its contents: Extensive restrictions on the how's and what's of union recruitment practices. Maybe then, its authors hoped, unions will be compelled to comport themselves to the image they promote... and show the American people how spectacularly they fail at practicing what they preach.\n\nNaturally, the now-named Union Recruitment Standards Act was received just as partisanly as it was written. Republicans bellowed their assent, Democrats muttered their approval, over half the National Progressives screeched their opprobrium, and the rest broke ranks and hollered their \"commitment to beloved principle\". America fell in line with their Congressmen soon after; needless to say, its discourse over the proposed legislation violently reflected the animus that had settled in Congress like miasmatic vapor since the Second World War.\n\nBut there is nothing else both its supporters and detractors can do, now that the bill has entered judgement by Capitol Hill. The Ayes and Nays have been courted, arms twisted, favors owed and hands shaked. President Goldwater can only shuffle in his seat and see these maneuvers waltz a Congressional ballet on the session floor -- if, of course, they decide to attend at all."

Less sympathetic observers would describe the President's response as a diatribe spoken in bad faith.\n\nTwo hundred million Americans react as variedly as one would expect from two hundred million minds.

At least there was consensus on who first to deal with -- that onerous honor belonged to the Senators sympathetic to the trade unionists' cause. Where American compromise stumbled was in these Senators' party affiliations.\n\nIn this issue his allies are split into two roughly even camps. The first he calls the Partisans, so named for their visceral hatred for the cretins in the NPP. One can even say their willingness to toss the opposition into the howling wilderness supersedes their commitment to ending corruption in politics, adamant as they are in ensuring that the campaign focus only on the leftists and progressives among the NPP's ranks. Nevertheless, they do raise some good points; chief among them is the fact that, should their strategy be undertaken fully, the NPP will leave this mess a shattered pot money can no longer repair.\n\nThe other side of the conversation is the Idealists: Noble men who rallied around the President's clarion call against the socialist menace and of their own volition. They suggest that the sword of justice fall equally onto both parties, else the people would see the campaign only as an act of hypocrisy. Notable in their rhetoric are suggestions that the Democrats share their adversaries' fate -- after all, have the Senators of New England and the Midwest not received their share of the red-tainted spoils as well?\n\nWhatever President Goldwater chooses will decide the course of his campaign hence.

He took a small sample of minutes-old coffee, wincing at the acrid taste as he set the mug onto its plate. Pure black's never easy to get used to, even after drinking nothing but it for days.\n\nBut it was easy to lash out when he heard the news. Lash out at his fellow Americans for not backing him to the hilt. Lash out at the Justices for letting the union bastards get off scot-free. Lash out at God for not sending him a miracle at the end of so much effort. Hatred was strong and raw then, so very tempting to wield.\n\nThankfully, reason quickly reasserted itself. He had his victories, the unions have theirs. He may not have brought the whole thing down, but neither had they gotten away without a nasty limp. He still has half of America on his side, and a good chunk of Congress to boot. His campaign's wounded and bleeding -- but it's not yet out. Never out, if he had his way.\n\nAnd so it was that he addressed his Cabinet later in the day, thanking them for the work they were putting to bring the unions down. They needed reassurance after seeing them \"come to naught\" against the AFL-CIO. No matter, he said, there's still everyone else. If not America's biggest union, then the bottom feeders nibbling at the scraps it leaves behind.\n\nHoover got a different message shortly after, in yet another of their \"personal conversations\" behind closed doors."

Sweeter than his standard fare; then again, today was nothing standard either.\n\nGlancing across the table, Barry saw the Director's poison-laced stare bore holes at today's issue of The Washington Times. Its front page had a still of the Supreme Court immediately after the vote, captioned \"SC VOTES 5-4 TO CUT AFL-CIO DOWN\" underneath. The President felt his grin grow wider.\n\nSure, the union bastards got away in the end. But they also left behind a waterfall of blood as they shambled away to wherever dark crevasse they'd come from. He took another sip from his mug -- slightly bitter, just the right amount of sweet. He can live with a flavor like that.\n\n\"What do you mean, Speed?\" the President inquired. \"We'll do what we've been doing ever since I made the Oval Office my bedroom.\"\n\n\"The Court didn't do enough. Who's to say they won't get back up again?\" The Director swigged half his coffee in one gulp, before setting it aside.\n\n\"With the penalties coming their way, and the other laws besides? They'll be lucky to make it past the end of the century.\" Barry continued, \"The message got across, that's what matters. We'll come for the rest of them soon enough.\""

Barry Goldwater always preferred the slight hint of sweetness two cubes of sugar and one teaspoon of cream offered to the palette. This time he added twice the sugar and thrice the cream to the mug, before pouring boiling water to mix. Hot mocha seemed appropriate for starting a very promising day -- a little treat every now and then never hurt anybody.\n\nHe had every reason to treat himself, really. If bringing down the fattest socialist hydra in America didn't at least deserve a sugar rush on his part, then why bother celebrating anything at all?\n\nLast night's celebrations still struck vivid images in his mind. Good cheers rang throughout the White House as rich vintages, reserved only for special occasions, flowed the length of its hallways like life-giving rivers. His staff unstuck themselves from that one moment of disbelief upon hearing the decision by hugging and kissing each other as if Christmas Eve and New Years put together had come. He joined in of course. If the kids can have their fun, then so can this old timer with all the stress to burn.\n\nBarry allowed himself a gulp of rich, creamy hot mocha. Of course there'd be fallout; he heard fallout shouting and chanting slogans even from the comfort of his kitchen, sounding like gouts of fire sweeping a crackling inferno across DC. He can start putting fires out after getting prepared for another day in the White House. But for now?\n\nThe President downed the rest of his coffee with one flick of the wrist.

None of them bode well for Goldwater.\n\nIt began, according to testimony, when a guard working the night shift in the American Federation of Teachers building at New Jersey Avenue spotted unusual lights coming from one of the fifth floor facade windows. The nine-story compound had already closed for the day hours earlier; that the lights seemed to flicker from spot to spot roused the guard's suspicion that thieves had broken in. Entering with a spare key, he climbed the stairs hoping to apprehend them before they accost with stolen valuables.\n\nWhat followed was a scuffle with no less than three persons, fully clad in black from head to toe. Surprisingly the guard only received minor cuts and bruises from the group, who had suddenly fled after knocking him to the ground. Why they didn't bother checking if he was conscious remains a mystery, but it was one that proved to benefit the disheveled officer as he inspected what they had left behind.\n\nPapers covered the desks and floor, scattered haystrewn across the office. Drawers gaped open, now emptier without their paper -- but their more valuable effects were left virtually untouched. Cubicle after cubicle of upended folders and undisturbed paper bills. By now the guard was befuddled and confused; just what were the thieves looking for?\n\nAfter switching the lights on, however, he then noticed gold glimmering half-beneath the sea of crisp, white letter paper. Brushing aside the sheafs, he picked it up.\n\nThus, at 1:13 in the early morning, the Metropolitan Police Department woke up to a security guard with an FBI badge held by a shaky vice grip. Thirty minutes later, every news station in the country woke up to an MPD statement that said FBI agents unlawfully entered the AFL compound at midnight. Five hours later, two hundred million Americans woke up to headlines, in bold, flashing print, that said the FBI had burgled a labor union."

But with the way Reagan put it...\n\nLaid in front of his half of the sofa, Willow shuffled deeper into James's lazy, one-armed embrace.

Finally, he responded: \"Get me Schmidt. Tell him to stop whatever he's doing and come here at once.\" At this command, the orderly gave him a quick salute and departed the office immediately.\n\nA furrowed brow was the only indication of the fury building within Speer's heart. After all his valiant effort towards détente with the Americans, this new President was simply about to throw it away to satisfy the whims of his electorate. He stood, pacing towards the window to calm his mind. Beyond the glass, Germania still bore the scars of the war. Trade was the lifeblood of nations, and without it a wounded nation like Germany would struggle to pull itself up from the ashes.\n\nA few moments passed before Helmut Schmidt strode briskly into the office. The concerned look on his face as he saluted indicated that he was clearly already aware of the situation. \"You asked to see me, my Führer?\"\n\n\"The Americans have restored the embargo.

He supposed it was only a matter of time before they came protesting about the embargo, though he wished it had not come during his brief respite.\n\nHelmut Schmidt was a curious character. Despite his nation's poor diplomatic reputation, the man seemingly oozed a calm sort of confidence. Irrespective of the animosity between their nations, Schmidt was cordial as he spoke at length with McNamara.\n\n\"Mr. McNamara, speaking on behalf of Führer Albert Speer and the Greater German Reich, I implore your government to reconsider this course of action. There is much benefit to be had from trade between our two great nations, I'm sure you understand. I am willing to personally travel to negotiate with your President, in the interests of normalizing diplomatic relations once again.\"\n\nWithin hours of this phone call, McNamara sat in the Oval Office, recounting the discussion to President Goldwater. \"The Germans seem willing to parley with us, but the American public expects us to uphold our promises and stop trade with the fascists,\" McNamara concluded. \"I told him I would call him back with your response shortly. What do you want me to say, Mr. President?\"\n\nGoldwater thought for a moment. It was certain that America held the upper hand. Perhaps if he met with this Schmidt, he could twist the Germans' arm and get them to make some major concessions in exchange for a more lenient policy. Done well, he could really show the world that America was undisputedly a superior power to Germany. On the other hand, simply telling the Germans that no means no would be a firm statement in its own right, and stonewalling them would reinforce his voters' faith in his commitment to shutting off the fascist powers.\n\nAfter a discussion with his advisors, Goldwater turned once more to McNamarra. \"Get him back on the line.

German businesses in the OFN were rapidly shuttering, and some Reich owned cargo ships had reportedly made a hasty retreat from American ports for fear of being arrested or even fired upon.\n\nAfter the two men exchanged some words, Schmidt left Speer to go and fetch the advisors for a meeting. Once more, Speer found himself glancing out the window at the scarred cityscape of Germania, wondering what more could be done. If he faltered here, this loss of prestige could prove damaging to his already tenuous leadership of the Reich.\n\n\"The Americans aren't taking us seriously.\" He pondered to himself for a moment. It was then he had an idea. It was unprecedented and downright improbable, but he had to try. \"They will not take Germany seriously, but perhaps they will take me seriously.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, Speer sat with Schmidt and several adivsors to discuss the situation. Amidst the chaotic chatter and contingency planning, Speer spoke up suddenly. \"Perhaps the Americans will listen if I talk directly to them.\"\n\nThere was silence at the table. \"Pardon, my Führer?\" asked Schmidt, incredulity barely concealed.\n\nSpeer gazed back at him, a determined look in his eye. \"We can arrange a meeting.

This was certainly unprecedented. Barring the brief period of the embargo being lifted, relations between America and Nazi Germany had been cold at best, and their heads of state had never met directly. He stroked his chin for a moment as he considered the implications.\n\n\"Where would we even meet? I doubt he'd be willing to come to America, and I'm not stepping foot in that cursed country.\"\n\n\"He has proposed that you meet him in Geneva. The Swiss are leery of the Germans at the best of times, but they're willing to offer us neutral ground to meet.\"\n\nSo the man has clearly given thought to this, thought Goldwater. At first, he almost laughed. It was absurd, and quite frankly reeked of desperation to overturn the embargo. What was he supposed to do? Fly to Geneva, tell Speer 'no' and then fly back home?\n\nAnd yet as he thought on it, that alone almost sounded like a golden opportunity. As he had already remarked, the Germans were desperate; America had the upper hand here. To go to Geneva, meet the Führer face to face, and then before all the world tell the leader of the so-called \"master race\" where to shove it?\n\nGoldwater would be an American hero overnight.\n\nIt was still perhaps a simply unnecessary exercise, and he still had half a mind to refuse outright. But perhaps this was the optimal moment to show the Germans who was boss. After all, it was unlikely a despot like Speer was likely to change Goldwater's mind on anything."

You can leave now.\" Schmidt gave a final salute and an apologetic look before he turned and left the office.\n\nSpeer sat quietly at the desk and ruminated on this defeat snatched from victory. He had been close, so close, to repairing relations between two of the world's foremost superpowers. Alas, thanks to the whims of American democracy and stubborn American pride, Germany was back at square one. The loss of prosperity to both nations would be significant, but undoubtedly it would be Germany, cast in the role of pariah once more, that took the greater hit to its prestige.\n\nThe Führer sighed heartily. He supposed there was little to be done. The Americans had made their choice, and perhaps four, eight or however many years from now they would change their minds. For now, all he could do was lead as he did before. Pacing once more to the window and looking out at the city, he resigned himself to the hope that the people would struggle on regardless. The German nation was strong, and there were other partners to be made in this wide world. Germany would have to pull itself from the ashes without reliance on America or any other nation, just as it had done once before."

A moment passed as Speer collected his racing thoughts. Finally he stood, almost too quickly, and motioned for Schmidt to follow him as he marched from the office. \"Cancel my appointments for the week,\" he instructed his secretary as he passed, \"and have someone pack my travel essentials.\"\n\nStriding further ahead, Speer had an almost manic energy in his step as he conversed with Schmidt. \"We have much to prepare.

Pushing back the more ridiculous scenarios like this being some harebrained German plot to assassinate him to the back of his mind, Goldwater himself began mentally preparing himself for the meeting.\n\nThe Swiss capital was undoubtedly beautiful, and sizable crowds had gathered to watch as his armored motorcade passed through. As he approached the designated meeting point, Goldwater wondered what Speer himself would be like. He had seen some footage of Speer speaking, in the aftermath of the German Civil War and several times since, and while he certainly seemed to be less of a firebrand than Adolf Hitler had been in his heyday, he was still most definitely a Nazi. Speer would almost certainly be speaking from a position of deluded superiority, which might make talking to him more difficult.\n\n\"It will at least make putting him in his place all the more sweet,\" he remarked to no-one in particular.\n\nThe scene outside of the hotel was intense as his car pulled up. Several Secret Service agents had gone ahead and secured the hotel, while some of Speer's bodyguards had done the same. The two groups regarded each other with a mixture of cold contempt and silent curiosity, but both maintained their distance and followed protocol. As Goldwater stepped out of the vehicle, another car pulled around the corner and parked a short distance from his. And out from the car, wearing a plain grey suit marred only by the armband of the swastika, was the Führer himself.\n\nThe two men stared at each other for a moment. Goldwater expected him to give some long winded remark about the pride of the German nation and then greet him with a Nazi salute.

 GLD.Speer.8.desc: "The American President Goldwater had arrived at the hotel shortly before Speer himself. Speer had debated what to do upon meeting him, considering a quick salute and a bow of acknowledgement, but Schmidt had argued that a simple handshake and a greeting in English would be more diplomatic. And so the two had shaken hands, being immortalized in an image likely by now already circling through the world's media. The two entered a reserved hotel room along with their respective translators, with their security details waiting outside the doors.\n\nThe world leaders were tense as they sat opposite each other. They danced around the subject at hand for a while. \"How was your flight, Mr. Goldwater?\" asked Speer.\n\n\"Pleasant,\" replied Goldwater tersely, before pausing for a while. \"I understand that the reconstruction of your country is going well?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\" As the small talk wore on, Speer knew that they would soon have to face the subject at hand. He thought back to the angles that he had discussed with Schmidt, and weighed up his options. He could try to address Goldwater's concerns about Germany's past, using his reforms as proof that Germany had changed enough to appease the Americans' sense of righteousness. Alternatively, he could push for Goldwater to consider allowing his allied nations to sidestep the embargo in the interests of free trade, allowing Germany to retain some of its business ties there. Finally, if all else failed, he could resort to flattery to appeal to the famous American ego.\n\nA silence had begun to build between them. Speer knew he had to say something, or else Goldwater would surely grow bored and leave."
 GLD.Speer.8.a: "I swear to you, things are changing!"
 GLD.Speer.8.b: "Surely the OFN gets a choice?"
 GLD.Speer.8.c: "You are a bold and wise man, Goldwater."
 GLD.Speer.9.t: "아버지의 죄"
 GLD.Speer.9.desc: "After the clicking of the press cameras and the heavy footfalls of their combined security entourage had faded away, Goldwater and Speer now found themselves alone (barring their respective translators) in the designated hotel room, with their security details waiting outside. The two men sat together at a table. Several attempts at conversation were made, though the language barrier and the latent tension of the situation made the initial smalltalk rather stilted. Goldwater was beginning to consider whether this had truly been a waste of time, before Speer's face became set with determination and he began to speak in earnest.\n\n\"I will confess to you, Mr. Goldwater, that my nation has made many... misjudgements in its past. We allowed renegade groups such as the SS, and power hungry men like Bormann and Göring to wield power, and in doing so allowed terrible acts to be committed in our Fatherland's name. Understand that the Germany I rule over now is not the Germany of yesteryear. I can assure you that all we desire is peace, trade and brotherhood with the nations of the world.\" Goldwater listened as Speer's translator relayed this spiel to him, noting the translator's clear shock and discomfort at Speer's denunciation of his regime's past actions.\n\nIn spite of himself, Goldwater felt a rush of fury. Speer sounded sincere, but he was being careful. Careful not to implicate himself, or his dear late Hitler. Careful to lay the blame on his enemies, absolving himself of any part in the crimes of his despicable regime. Careful to present himself not as a snivelling minion of evil but a blameless savior. If ever there was a time to denounce Speer as the monster he was and make his bold exit, now was that time.\n\nAnd yet perhaps he could work with this. Speer wanted to present himself as a reformer; maybe it was time to make him put his money where his mouth was. He could offer Speer the trade he so dearly wanted, but only if he agreed to end Nazism, allow free elections, decolonize Europe, free the slaves and abolish his oversized military. If he refused (which he obviously would), then all the world would see what a hypocrite the Führer was.\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a moment's pause before he spoke."
 GLD.Speer.9.a: "당신은 많은 좋은 일을 해왔지만..."
 GLD.Speer.9.b: "You are a self-serving bag of excuses! We're done!"
 GLD.Speer.10.t: "The Door to the Face"
 GLD.Speer.10.desc: "\"...and in doing so allowed terrible acts to be committed in our Fatherland's name. Understand that the Germany I rule over now is not the Germany of yesteryear. I can assure you that all we desire is peace, trade and brotherhood with the nations of the world.\"\n\nSpeer waited as his translator relayed his words to the President. He noted two things. The first was the look of clear shock in his translator's eyes at the words he was made to say. He supposed it was only natural - the man had been brought up to love his Fatherland unconditionally, so acknowledging its faults must feel like finding out a dark family secret. The second thing was Goldwater's reaction. The President was silent for a moment, but a brief flash of anger appeared in his expression. This was quickly replaced by what could only be a look of cunning, and Speer braced himself for what he was about to say.\n\n\"It is true that you have done much to reform your country, but I question how much of what you say is genuine. You say you are a reformer, Herr Speer? If what you say is true, then perhaps you will stand down? Allow the German people free and fair democratic elections and open up your economic sphere to the world. Perhaps then I would be willing to allow trade with Germany.\"\n\nSpeer stared for a moment, dumbstruck. Was this some attempt at American humor? He had made the effort to reach out, and now the American mocked him with such unreasonable demands! He was almost tempted to storm out immediately, but his thoughts caught on something. Specifically, Goldwater's insistence that Germany open its economic sphere to America. Was this not a little hypocritical, given Goldwater's strict missive to his allied nations to cease trade with Germany? Perhaps he could capitalize on this contradiction... or he could leave the arrogant American to his delusions."
 GLD.Speer.10.a: "The pot calls the kettle black, Mr. Goldwater."
 GLD.Speer.10.b: "Are you serious? This was a waste of time."
 GLD.Speer.11.t: "응수"
 GLD.Speer.11.desc: "\"You say you are a reformer, Herr Speer? If what you say is true, then perhaps you will stand down? Allow the German people free and fair democratic elections and open up your economic sphere to the world. Perhaps then I would be willing to allow trade with Germany.\"\n\nAs Goldwater's translator relayed his words to Speer, the Führer's face grew increasingly aghast. Goldwater actually had to suppress a laugh. He had caught Speer out on his hypocrisy, and as soon as he got back to America he would regale the press with how the Führer sputtered and stumbled and came up with a thousand excuses for the continuation of his regime. He could already picture the headlines, the documentaries, the inevitable historical significance of -\n\nSpeer laughed. Not a laugh of nervousness or fear, but of amusement. Speer began speaking, his brow cocked slightly as he spoke, and Goldwater found himself suddenly on edge as he awaited the translation.\n\n\"You are clearly committed to your ideals of democracy, Mr. Goldwater. Or are you? I notice that you insist upon principles of free trade, and yet in your embargo you expressly forbid nations under the American alliance from trading with Germany. This is somewhat hypocritical, no? Especially for an alliance known as the Organization of 'Free' Nations. Perhaps if you wish to talk of openness, you should start by allowing the many great nations under the American wing to trade with whoever they please.\"\n\nGoldwater started. Then he stopped. And started and stopped again. He tried to think of a retort but fell short. Did Speer have a point? Goldwater felt sweat building as he tried to respond. If Speer made this same point to the wider world, perhaps the other OFN nations would agree. Perhaps they were right to agree? Attempting to keep his cool, Goldwater began to consider conceding Speer's point. Or perhaps, to prevent further unfortunate lines of questioning, he should end the session here."
 GLD.Speer.11.a: "...oh. He has a point."
 GLD.Speer.11.b: "I... you... what?! No, we're done here!"
 GLD.Speer.12.t: "The German Sidestep"
 GLD.Speer.12.desc: "After the clicking of the press cameras and the heavy footfalls of their combined security entourage had faded away, Goldwater and Speer now found themselves alone (barring their respective translators) in the designated hotel room, with their security details waiting outside. The two men sat together at a table. Several attempts at conversation were made, though the language barrier and the latent tension of the situation made the initial smalltalk rather stilted. Goldwater was beginning to consider whether this had truly been a waste of time, before Speer's face became set with determination and he began to speak in earnest.\n\n\"Mr. Goldwater, I understand that our nations have had a historically strained relationship, and I will not attempt to alter that perception today. What I would instead propose is that you leave your allied nations out of it. The rest of your Organization of Free Nations should be permitted to trade with Germany if they so wish.\"\n\nAs Speer's translator finished relaying his words, Goldwater immediately scowled. \"Is this why you brought me here today? So that you could propose sidestepping my authority and slipping into the western markets through the backdoor?\" He leaned forwards before Speer had a chance to speak up. \"Listen to me, Mr. Speer. I vowed to my people that I would shut fascism out of the Organization of Free Nations. I must emphasise - Free nations, Mr. Speer. As long as your people continue to goosestep their way into the darkness, I will uphold that vow.\"\n\nSpeer stuttered as he tried to respond. \"I have done much to bring Germany into modernity! Even a man like you must see that-\"\n\nGoldwater stood, a dark look taking his face. \"A man like me? And what do you mean by that? Do you insult me as an American? Or perhaps you refer to the fact that my father was a Jew? Does that make you uncomfortable, Mr. Speer?\" As the Führer stumbled for words, the President scoffed. \"I can't believe I agreed to come here. You are no different to your beloved Hitler. Good day, Mr. Speer.\" With nary another word, he turned and stormed bitterly from the room."
 GLD.Speer.12.a: "What nonsense. We're done here."
 GLD.Speer.13.t: "The Unlikeliest Deal"
 GLD.Speer.13.desc: "Goldwater had expected to come to Geneva to show Speer who was boss. Instead, they were now making a deal.\n\nSpeer, somehow, had convinced him. While the specifics of the agreement would still need to be formally ratified, the embargo would soon be significantly loosened and trade would flow once again between the OFN and the Einheitspakt. Goldwater wondered how exactly congress and the voters would respond to this development, and even as they began to depart he wondered if it was too late to back out.\n\nAs the President and the Führer stood in the hotel foyer, Speer turned to Goldwater and offered a handshake for the second and final time. \"This was a productive meeting, Mr. Goldwater. I look forward to future dialogue with the United States\".\n\nGoldwater paused as he returned the handshake. Shaking hands with a man whose country would consider someone of Jewish blood like himself as less than human still felt troubling. \"This was more... diplomatic than I was expecting. Thank you for your time\". With that, the two men departed the hotel for their respective return trips.\n\nGoldwater had a lot of time to think as his flight made its journey back to America. What would he say to the press? How would the party respond to his unexpected u-turn? What was his own take away from all of this? This had certainly not been the trip he had anticipated, and he was unsure if he would ever feel completely at ease about it. It was all making his head spin. Whatever else happened, he dearly hoped that this would be the only time he would ever meet Albert Speer."
 GLD.Speer.13.a: "Let's never do this again."
 GLD.Speer.14.t: "The Door Lies Open"
 GLD.Speer.14.desc: "Speer felt confident, proud even, as he sat in his jet back to Germania. He had come to Geneva with the most bold, longshot diplomatic overture Germany had made in a hundred years and come out on top. Goldwater had agreed to loosen the embargo and German business would surely breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nFor years, Germany had asserted its might through military dominance, yet Speer had now proved that they could also stand up in a war of words. That Goldwater, a man who had taken power on a platform of anti-fascist opposition and anti-German sentiment, had been convinced of the error of his ways was a great victory for the Reich - and for world trade as a whole.\n\nAs he returned to Germania, he was first greeted by Schmidt. \"An excellent display, my Führer!\" said Schmidt as he pushed a copy of the morning paper into his hands. The headline celebrated Germany's diplomatic coup, hailing Speer's overpowering of the USA's decision. It was a little embellished, as all German media tended to be, but Speer supposed it would do.\n\nAs he returned to his duties as Führer, Speer felt satisfied that he had proven his worth and demonstrated his new path for Germany. The time for tanks charging across Europe was over; now was the time for the Reich to take its place on the world stage as a true diplomatic player."
 GLD.Speer.14.a: "The pen is mightier than the Panzer."
 GLD.Speer.100.t: "The Door Creaks Closed"
 GLD.Speer.100.desc: "Despite it all, Speer had failed. Goldwater had had enough and the world's press was already awash with the images of him storming angrily from the hotel, Speer himself emerging regretfully a while afterwards. He was not terribly surprised - the talks had been a long-shot after all - but he was disappointed all the same.\n\nThe condolences from Schmidt and the assertion by the German press that the failure was entirely the fault of the unreasonable and arrogant Americans did little to sooth his gloominess as he arrived back in Germania. The ceaseless messages from the major conglomerates lamenting their lost foreign assets left him gloomier still. He had failed. A man in his position could not afford failure. Weakness in the face of the tasks that still lay ahead for Germany was unacceptable.\n\nSitting at his desk, he considered where Germany might go from here. A relief package to dampen the woes of affected businesses was a given. A meeting with the economic bigwigs to determine alternate trade partners would also be essential. Yet no matter what, this failure would hang over his head for a long time. Securing free trade with the west had been one of his greatest diplomatic achievements. Now he had lost that and lost face all at once. It seemed that America and Germany were destined to be enemies."
 GLD.Speer.100.a: "망할 골드워터!"
 GLD.Speer.103.t: "예상된 결과"
 GLD.Speer.103.desc: "The talks had failed. Though it had been Speer's own idea, the world's media was already awash with images of Speer marching frustrated from the hotel. The images of Goldwater emerging moments later showed a face tinged with equal parts irritation and smugness. That was exactly how he felt as he flew home over the Atlantic. It was a wasted journey, but at least he had made Speer look like a fool.\n\nWhen Goldwater arrived back in America, he found himself quickly swept before the journalists, all eager to hear his account of things. He smiled for the cameras, and waited for the hubbub to die down before speaking.\n\n\"Mr. Speer is no different to his predecessor, nor any of those who tried to claim Germany in the past. He believes that his country deserves all the bounty of the Free World without being part of it. I tried to be reasonable, and I decided to hear him out in the interests of international diplomacy. Unfortunately, it is clear that even under its new ruler, the ego of the German nation knows no bounds.\"\n\n\"Let this be a lesson to all those who rule with an iron fist. If you are willing to extend liberty, then liberty will extend its bounty unto you. If not, then the bounty shall forever be denied.\"\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a smile as he returned to the White House. He had kept his promise to the American people, shown up the forces of fascism, and demonstrated once and for all that America would always stand tall in the face of tyranny. It would surely be a great precedent for the future of the world - and for the future of his election prospects."

Maybe it's the blandness of the tenement brick, maybe it's the polluted city air.\n\nPerhaps, though, it's the rotten state of this country. At least to Robert.\n\nRobert can trace his heritage back to some of the first emancipated slaves in America. His grandfather served in the Harlem Hellfighters. His own father gave everything in the Pacific, and never came home. Robert, directionless after high school, decided to enlist in the Army. Life was rough after being injured in South Africa. Even in a state like New York, no place had room for a handicapped minority man. He worked odd jobs for years, barely scraping by with the help of the NPP's generous welfare programs. While he didn't care much for politics, his interest peaked at a President which promised economic prosperity for all.\n\nBut that was then. No more food stamps, they say, it's a waste of money. We need to slash welfare; we could be using that for the environment, experts claim. Austerity, designed to bring economic prosperity for all and reduce the national debt, has simply taken it from the people who needed it most. Robert sighed, cold in his own home. Come next November, he's going to make his voice heard. Whoever is in that office, something is clear. He can't keep going on like this."

A bottle of champagne popped on the trading floor. Stock traders from opposite sides of the room are dancing together. \"Tonight, your families will eat well. Little Suzie will get all the toys she wants for Christmas. You can finally buy that new car you've been eyeing for ages. Tonight, you will reap the rewards of the best economy in the history of the world!\"\n\nThe sound is deafening; so much so that spectators outside pause in the street in awe. Although the people on the floor were simple stock traders, all from different walks of life, one thing was clear. They were rich, and they loved America. And perhaps, one day, everyone would be able to flourish from the economy that they've helped create. Public confidence has been restored in a system that works for everyone, with equal opportunity for success. No more will John Doe be scared of investment, scared of starting a business, or making money. The American Dream seems alive again."

Ever since that fateful day in Midway, Joseph does his best working as a shift manager at a factory. The veterans benefits are good. He lives comfortably with his wife and two children. He's active in his community, gives rifle lessons, and recently spoke at his town hall. He was one of the many people who voted in the last election.\n\nToday, Joseph woke up bright and early, as he typically does. Usually he likes to start his day with a shower, and then reading the morning paper as Lucy makes him and the kids some breakfast. But this morning was a bit different. The paperboy came early. A few people were already outside their houses, so it must've been important. With a stretch and groan, Joseph opens the front door, and picks up the paper. \"NPP OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON TAKING MONEY FROM JAPAN\" is plastered on the front. Joseph rubbed his eyes, making sure that what he was seeing was true. With a pause, he closes the door, and sits down at the dinner table.\n\n\"Honey, what's wrong? Is everything okay?\"\n\n\"Yes, Lucy. Apparently the neighbors thought today's paper is interesting. I don't blame them.\"\n\nPeople in these parts voted straight down the line for the NPP. Maybe it was out of solidarity for our brothers in California. Maybe it was because of how hard everyone here was hit by the war. Maybe it was just how things were here. But the more Joseph read of the paper, the more frustrated he got. To think that the people he voted for are taking money from the people who shot down his brother's plane infuriated him. He puts the paper down, and sighs heavily. If there is change to come this November, it'll certainly not be for a party which is funded by warmongers."

It's not right, it's not American, and President Goldwater is on the case!

We fought for American liberty, for the very American Dream which earned us our independence; however, now all we can find is the sorrow of defeat within the Presidency, and a lesser and lesser chance at reelection as thoughts towards the future echo throughout the President's mind..."

Whilst the Supreme Court did not fully obliterate the AFL-CIO, it did manage to create several impositions against the powers of the Unions and how much they can hamper large American businesses.

Furthermore, President Goldwater has realized that the NPP stands as a far greater suspect in the game of corruption within the United States; thus, it ought to be our highest priority to snuff out corruption amidst the NPP before anywhere else in the government."

Finally, we shall undo the curses of corruption upon the American market that the extremely bloated and overzealous union organizations brought upon it, and bring about a new era of shiny, golden prosperity for all the hardworking American patriots throughout the country!"

 POLITICS_GEORGE_ROMNEY_DESC:0 "George W. Romney was born to all-American parents in the Mormon colonies of Mexico. From an early age, he interacted with strong themes of religiosity, a factor that would influence him later in life. Eventually due to the Mexican Revolution of 1910, his family fled back to the United States moving from city to city, struggling financially during the Depression years, until ultimately arriving in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nAs an adult, he worked in several part-time jobs and attempted to secure a college education several times - failing each round, eventually ending up in Detroit where he worked for the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), which gained him his claim to fame as the chief spokesman within the automobile industry at the height of World War II. Dejected following America's coerced defeat, he would go on to work in the private sector - first at Nash-Kelvinator in '48 and then as CEO of it's successor, the American Motors Corporation in '54.\n\nBy 1960, Romney tired of the corporate life, inspired by his strong religious convictions he ran for Governor of Michigan in '61 as the candidate for the Republican-Democrats, re-elected multiple times he eventually took the side of the marginalized in the Civil Rights Movement arguing against party dissenters like Goldwater and Dixiecrat opposition figures like Strom Thurmond - even going as far as to condemn the NPP for harboring 'traitorous elements' in response to a speech by the Sovereigntist leader Byers in his home state of Utah.\n\nNow after a tumultuous decade, Romney represents peace, stability, order and good old Christian America, leading the Conservative wing of the RDCs, George W. Romney has ascended to the ranks of the Oval Office intent on building an America for everyone , strengthened by Christ and steadfast in spirit."

 USA_gld_68_WAL_separate_schools_arent_equal_desc: "\"Separate but equal,\" went the mantra Wallace and his cronies unabashedly uttered in front of the American people when they justified strengthening school segregation laws within and without the South. The white man cannot understand the black man fully, so they went, and neither can the black man understand the white man no matter their shared values and patrimony. Better that each race assign their own skilled to teach their own children, rather than coerce either race to fulfill a task in which they cannot possibly succeed. Again, so they went.\n\nThese seemingly sensible reassurances, expectedly, turned out to be window dressing for more sinister intentions. For while white districts carried on business as usual, black districts faced desolation from their already meagre budget dwindling into flies through a combination of budget cuts and redistricting. Clearly, separating the equal only furthered existing inequalities -- and the President aims to do away with the concept fully, despite the furor the South will raise."
