 LIB_idea_gridlocked_politics: "Gridlocked Politics"
 LIB_idea_gridlocked_politics_desc: "Many ideas may flourish in one small West African state, but one man's party has built a dynasty out of them. For well over a decade, William Tubman's True Whig party has dominated all aspects of Liberian politics, and no other political organization has mustered enough power to match the party. Tubman's grip on Liberia is strong, almost unlimited, and it can only be countered by the will of his own people. Until the masses organize enough to rally against him, Tubman's power is simply absolute."
 LIB_idea_ofn_support: "OFN Support"
 LIB_idea_ofn_support_desc: "Historically, Liberia is a product of the contemptible American Colonization Society of the 19th century. Even its capital is named after former American President James Monroe. Thus, it's no surprise that Liberia enjoys the gracious support of the American-led OFN. However, Liberia has since grown away from its American roots and more towards its own path, pursuing an open-door policy with other powers. As Tubman branches out into new markets, the OFN slowly retracts."
 LIB_idea_widespread_corruption: "Widespread Corruption"
 LIB_idea_widespread_corruption_desc: "The gateway to absolute power in Liberia is its extensive corruption; without corruption, the government will fall. With Tubman exerting almost complete control over Liberia, he can strike any deal he wants if it benefits him. He regularly invites foreign companies to purchase land in Liberia, stealing power from the people and ignoring historic treaties. Tubman himself often profits from the deals, leaving the angered masses out to dry. With every new deal, the people's voice grows louder..."
 LIB_idea_usa_resource: "American Military Support"
 LIB_idea_usa_resource_desc: "What the Americans cannot send us in men; they are sending in guns and bombs. While we still cannot defeat the Pan-Africanists on our own, it at least gives us a chance to hold the line until the OFN arrives in force."
 
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_TUBMAN_DESC: "There are many things one can call William Tubman. Corrupt is one of them. Controversial is another. A fool is not one.\n\nBorn into both a military and political family in 1895, William followed in his father's footsteps by running and winning a senate seat in 1923, becoming the youngest senator in Liberian history. From there, his political star only rose further, becoming President in 1942 as the World War raged around Liberia. No sooner had Tubman entered the office than order collapsed in West Africa, and a refugee crisis that had never been seen in African history threatened to engulf the tiny nation. However, Tubman steered the ship of state through the rough seas of the postwar order, aided by his friends in the OFN.\n\nAs time went on, though, Tubman grew more authoritarian and more isolationist, distancing himself from the OFN in favor of blissful neutrality. In today's Liberia, nobody challenges Tubman. This is not because there is no opposition to Tubman. Rather, it is because any who dare to challenge him are either too weak to command the opposition vote, corrupt enough to take the "gifts" from Tubman's administration and coincidentally end their run, or die in unfortunate accidents if they refuse the money.\n\nToday's Liberia is prosperous, peaceful, and united under Tubman. Undoubtedly the richest state in West Africa, Liberia commands a heavy trade presence in the Gold Coast. After all, despite all the differences of the Liberian people, Tubman is the father of modern Liberia. Of course, this system depends on Tubman's continued health, and if - or rather when - he finally passes on, the Liberian golden age may come crashing down on top of the Liberian people's heads."
