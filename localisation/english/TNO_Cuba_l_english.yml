POLITICS_FIDEL_CASTRO_DESC: "Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born on 13 August, 1926 to a wealthy family, the bastard son of his father's mistress. Despite a conservative Jesuit education, Fidel became a devout anti-fascist. His political life began at the University of Havana, throwing aside his law studies to join the populist Orthodoxo Party.\n\nIn 1952, General Batista launched a coup and crushed Cuba's fragile democracy under his boot. Fidel resorted to armed struggle, leading a daring but doomed attack on the Moncada Barracks on 26th July, 1953. Released from prison, he fled to Mexico to form a new rebellion under the 26th of July Movement, or M-26-7. Despite a disastrous landing in Cuba, Fidel and his rebels fled into the mountain jungles to wage a six-year guerrilla war.\n\nAlthough M-26-7's urban wing made invaluable contributions, it was Fidel and his colorful, bearded rebels who made headlines worldwide. It was their exploits and stunning victories that made Fidel the symbol of anti-Batista resistance in Cuba. The tide turned against Batista, and on New Year's Day, 1959, a triumphant Fidel entered Havana with his rebel army.\n\nCastro now serves as Cuba's Prime Minister, ruling as a flamboyant populist in the Latin American tradition. Since 1959, major reforms have swept Cuba to international acclaim, and the revolutionaries remain in the OFN's good graces for their proud anti-fascist stance.\n\nFidel espouses socialist views alongside Orthodoxo populism, and endorses direct democracy, but rules in a rather autocratic manner blended with Cuban nationalism. It's unclear if he'll be a democratic champion or another caudillo, but every Cuban knows that the self-proclaimed heir of José Martí will shape history forever."

# Ideas
CUB_idea_cuban_revolution: "The Cuban Revolution"
CUB_idea_cuban_revolution_desc: "To many, January 1st, 1959 was the end of the Cuban Revolution. Batista had been exiled, his regime toppled and his government scattered to the winds. To us, that January 1st was not an ending, but a beginning.\n\nSince that day, Cuba has been in a period of ongoing change, a permanent revolution, one where the myopic traditions holding her back have been swept aside in the name of national progress. Politically, socially, economically, nothing has been spared the hand of change, and yet, as the Revolution continues, the people rejoice. The Revolution enjoys great success and popularity at home, and even draws the interest of actors abroad. Our people are proud of the Revolution, and support its every tenet."
CUB_idea_reform_frenzy: "Reform Frenzy"
CUB_idea_reform_frenzy_desc: "Since the beginnings of the Revolution, Cuba has found herself in a state of constant flux. Nearly every month some new sweeping change is announced. Be it changes to land reform, healthcare, welfare, or education, the Cuba of ten years ago is hardly recognizable compared to the Cuba of today.\n\nTo many, these changes are a good thing; many of Cuba's immediate needs post Revolution have been addressed, and the life of the average Cuban is much better today than it was but a mere decade ago. A select few, however, worry that these changes are too much, too quickly, and fear that as the old Cuba unravels, she may find herself flying a bit too close to the sun."
CUB_idea_uncertain_direction: "Uncertain Direction"
CUB_idea_uncertain_direction_desc: "In the days following the Revolution, the myriad factions that banded together to overthrow the Batista regime have continued their one-time alliance. Forming the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations, or the ORI, these disparate factions have little more in common than a desire to see Cuba changed, and most desire to see El Comandante at her head.\n\nThis has led to an extremely dysfunctional political scene, and as the various factions that make up the ORI continue to pull the organization in opposite directions, the future of Cuba becomes more and more uncertain. Castro increasingly finds himself the only man in Cuba who can direct the ORI, and he must pick this direction soon, unless he should see his grand dream driven to ruin from infighting and division."
CUB_idea_question_democracy: "The Question of Democracy"
CUB_idea_question_democracy_desc: "Despite the extreme popularity of Castro, many in the ORI have begun to speak in hushed whispers of his more authoritarian tendencies. They speak of how comfortable he has become with his power, and question if he is to ever abandon it.\n\nAs time goes on, the idea of an end to Castro's governance seems like an increasingly distant possibility. With dissidents openly calling for elections in the streets, and Castro's ambiguous statements on the matter, the age-old question of the democracy that José Martí dreamed of has begun taking hold in the ORI's leadership. It is a question that must be addressed, and soon."
