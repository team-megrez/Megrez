 mor.106.t: "Morocco Overthrows the Protectorate!"
 mor.106.d: "Sensing our weakness against our enemies in the current conflict, the treacherous Moroccan government has elected to abandon our alliance at our darkest hour. The Moroccan King and his advisors summoned our ambassador to inform him that all of our forces in the region are to leave the country and that they will be declaring neutrality in foreign affairs. This is a deep insult, given how much we've aided their independence from French domination and how much they have benefited from our continued protection. No doubt, their neighbours are looking now with glee at the opportunity to carve up their lands thanks to Moroccan short-sightedness. Still, given our current circumstances, there have been calls within the cabinet to accept this turn of events as fait accompli. With our attention focused on achieving an ultimate victory over oour enemies, it might not be worth adding Morrocco to that list."

 MOR_country_intro_header: "모로코의 역사"
 MOR_country_intro_content: "In 1904, France and Spain carved out zones of influence in Morocco. Recognition by the United Kingdom of France's sphere of influence provoked a strong reaction from the German Empire, and a crisis loomed in 1905. The matter was resolved at the Algeciras Conference in 1906. The Agadir Crisis of 1911 increased tensions between European powers. The 1912 Treaty of Fez made Morocco a protectorate of France, and triggered massive riots. By the same treaty, Spain assumed the role of protecting power over the northern and southern Saharan zones. During the Weltkrieg, the Zaian Confederation of Berbers rebelled against France and received ample Central Power support, but failed to achieve any major victories until after the fall of France. While various pretenders attempted to negotiate with the German Empire, they were inconclusive, and in the end, Mohammed V was placed on the throne after his father abdicated. The new Sultan signed a new treaty with the Germans, one whose influence on internal Moroccan affairs was greatly diminished compared to the French Protectorate. The treaty is carefully worded as to render it as amicable as possible. However, tensions still flare up on occasion, sometimes requiring the German-backed Royal Guard to intervene. As the '30s roared in, Morocco recovered from the Protectorate era, yet relations with Algiers remain quite cool, event to the point that some nationalists advocate strengthening the alliance with the German Empire to secure Moroccan independence. The Sultan must safeguard Morocco against not only the revanchist French elites in Algeria, but also the savage revolutionaries in Paris who see Morocco as a gateway for the revolution into Africa and the Islamic World."
