 SWF_true_socialist_education_desc: "반동분자들이 만들어낸 교육은 참으로 창피하기 그지없고 그들의 유산을 우리가 물려받는 것 또한 수치스러운 일입니다. 학교는 아이들에게 반동적 사고를 가르칠 뿐만 아니라 다른 부분들조차도 제대로 가르쳐주지도 않고 있습니다. 더 좋은 교육은 모든 이들의 미래를 더 밝고 희망 차게 만들 수 있기에 에 우리는 진정한 사회주의 방식으로 교육 시스템을 변혁 해야 합니다."

 SWF_modern_agriculture: "사회주의 농업"

 SWF_artillery_effort_desc: "An armed revolution is a successful revolution, and a revolution armed with more than museum pieces and farmer's rifles is likely to be even more successful.

 SWF_army_of_maneuver: "기동군"
 SWF_army_of_maneuver_desc: "It is no longer the Weltkrieg, wars cannot be easily won by simply having a large cannon. Motorised divisions, tank brigades, and fast moving infantry are key to victory, and so they will be key to the armies of Spain."

 SWF_upgrade_air_ports_desc: "The infrastructure needed to support a large air force does not need to be built completely from the ground up.

 SWF_new_pilots: "Pilots of the Revolution"
 SWF_new_pilots_desc: "We are in urgent need of new pilots, people willing to risk death in the skies for the sake of the revolution.

 SWF_foreign_airplanes_desc: "Our country is not really in the position to manufacture an air force. For this reason, we must purchase old planes from abroad to help kickstart the Spanish Air Force. The air war is likely to become of greater importance as the Weltkrieg had suggested decades ago."
 SWF_army_air_support: "Army Air Support"
 SWF_army_air_support_desc: "The easiest enemy to fight is one who has already been killed by a bombing run before the battle begins, and so our air force should be focused on producing planes focused on battlefield support missions and bombing efforts to support our troops in their endeavours."

 SWF_voice_of_heaven: "붉은 창공"
 SWF_voice_of_heaven_desc: "Radar is a promising new technology which, with further development could provide a wealth of information about enemy tactics and positions and reveal the course of enemy aircraft. If our air force is to succeed in the skies, proper radar must be constructed to aid it."

 SWF_collectivise_factories: "Collectivise the Factories"
 SWF_collectivise_factories_desc: "No one man or woman should have the right to control the factories that are the lives of many of our citizens. Instead factories should be handed over to the collective ownership of the workers, allowing them to directly own the means of production."
 SWF_national_union: "국민연합"

 SWF_planned_economy: "Planned Economy"

 SWF_buenaventura_durruti_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gJuly 14th, 1896, in León, Kingdom of Spain\n§YPolitical Career:§! Being the son of a common labourer and socialist trade unionist, it is hardly a surprise that José Buenaventura Durruti Dumange would find his way to socialism and anarchist thought from a young age. However, very few who knew this man in his formative years could have predicted that less than two decades later he would become one of the premier commanders of the Spanish revolutionary cause.\n\nDespite strikes and worker disputes being commonplace in Durruti's childhood, his involvement in the general strike of 1917 would dramatically alter the direction of his life. Initially fleeing to France after the deployment of the Civil Guard against the strikers, he was rearrested not long after attempting to re-enter Spain. Managing to escape captivity and cross the border once again, Durruti soon found himself in the middle of the last days of the Third French Republic.\n\nUsing connections made during his prior stays in the nation, the young anarchist joined one of the many revolutionary cells across France participating in the uprising against the old regime. Distinguishing himself in the fighting for control of Marseilles, Durruti quickly attracted the attention of those in the new government who wished to export their revolution across the globe. His initial plans to return to Spain after the war's conclusion were soon scuppered by the strikes in Argentina developing into a full blown civil war.\n\nWithin a few months he would set sail for Patagonia alongside a few of his new comrades on an indiscernible vessel filled with leftover armaments from the Weltkrieg and Civil War. Their eventual arrival in Patagonia was met with a welcome from the strikers more akin to that of returning soldiers than one would expect in response to a simple military attaché. Even with this aid from France the war in Patagonia quickly reached a stalemate. With further victories seeming unlikely Durruti soon departed back to his homeland for many years, only returning to Patagonia much later alongside Nestor Makhno. Even without a full victory being achieved, words of his alleged exploits still began to spread like wildfire in anarchist circles.\n\nNow having returned to the land of his birth once more, Durruti has quickly become the figurehead of Spain's anarcho-syndicalist movement. While not often involving himself in much of the daily bureaucracy, his continuous influence upon it is hard for anyone to deny."
 SWF_francisco_largo_caballero_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gOctober 15th, 1869, in Madrid, Kingdom of Spain\n§YPolitical Career:§! Born into a life of poverty and raised by a single mother fleeing an abusive husband, Francisco Largo Caballero's journey through life has been far from an easy one. Forced to start work to support his family at just the age of 7, he would eventually find work as a plasterer, honing his trade specifically in stucco work. His continued work in this field into his twenties and the growing labour movement in the nation would soon inspire him to join the Workers' General Union (UGT). Membership of the UGT would a few years later lead to him also joining its close associate the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), the same party he now leads in the present day.\n\nLargo's fervent activism in support of the Spanish workers movement over the next two decades would see his gradual rise through the ranks into one of the primary leaders of Spanish socialism. Once merely just inspired by Pablo Iglesias, the founder and leader of PSOE, he soon became Iglesias's second in command and eventual successor during the rise of the de Rivera regime.\n\nUnder the new dictatorship, he initially adopted a controversial reformist approach by cooperating with the government. However, the untenability of complying with de Rivera's demands led Largo and the PSOE to eventually oppose the regime and join their fellow republicans in attempts to oust de Rivera, ultimately contributing to the establishment of the short-lived Second Republic.\n\nWith the new regime having seemingly cemented itself for good, Francisco Largo has assumed his role as leader of the new republic to guide it forwards. Many struggle to describe the ideology Largo now leads the nation with. Some have taken to labelling him as a \"revolutionary reformist\" on account of his more moderate views, others a \"Pabloist\" owing to his inspiration from the former leader, and some even labelling him \"Spain's Lenin\" in an often derogatory reference to the failed Bolshevik. Only time will truly show what legacy this political chameleon will leave behind for Spain and its peoples."
