As our vessels started steaming away from the enemy in good order, a pair of American destroyers arrived to investigate the skirmish. Possibly mistaking the new arrivals for being ours, the Nazi raiders changed targets and opened fire on the Americans, before beating a hasty retreat.\n\nIn the end, there doesn't appear to be casualties on any side of the skirmish, but the incident has still caused quite a stir across the Atlantic. The [USA.GetPresidentLastName] administration is calling for their country to retaliate against \"an attack on American freedom of navigation which threatens to shut our sailors out of Africa and the seas beyond\". President [USA.GetPresidentLastName] has told us privately that he means to greatly increase American aid to South Africa and ultimately their presence in the war, and this might have given him the pretext to do so."

 RD_SAF.21.desc: "Late last night, the United States Congress passed the Cape of Good Hope Resolution, authorizing President [USA.GetPresidentLastName] to take any measures he believes necessary to retaliate for the eponymous attack and to promote the maintenance of international peace and security in Africa. The [USA.GetPresidentLastName] administration has already assured us privately that they will do whatever it takes to help us win this war, and now it appears they have the legal cover to do so.\n\nThe President has already called for a substantial increase in the American presence on our continent, and large quantities of guns, tanks, fuel and ammo will soon start flowing to reinforce our armies. Soon after, American soldiers and airmen will follow, to stand shoulder to shoulder with our heroes of Africa against the vicious Reichskommissariat forces.\n\nThe mood around Cape Town is jubilant. Many, both on the street and in our administration, believe the turning point of the war has now been reached, and that victory will swiftly follow the American to Africa. A few voices caution that there will be a price to pay down the line for their involvement, but that is surely a problem for tomorrow. Whatever happens next, our fate is more intertwined with the Americans than ever before."

 RD_SAF.22.desc: "President [USA.GetPresidentLastName]'s South Africa strategy faces an uncertain future after the Cape of Good Hope Resolution failed to make it through Congress. Written to authorize the President to take any measures he believed were necessary to retaliate for the eponymous attack and to promote the maintenance of international peace and security in Africa, the resolution would have formed a legal basis for an increase in American presence on the continent and in the war.\n\nThis is a major blow to our war effort. The [USA.GetPresidentLastName] administration has been privately assuring us for some time that they are prepared to send a great deal more equipment and soldiers to reinforce us, but lacking the legal cover to do so there are doubts as to their ability to follow through on those assurances. An apologetic representative of their government has promised us they will continue to look for avenues to send us more support, but it looks like we will have to pursue the war without them for the foreseeable future."

 RD_SAF.23.desc: "At 21:17 last night, a situation emerged a hundred nautical miles south-east of the Cape of Good Hope. A small raiding force from the Afrikanische Flotte made contact with a convoy flying South African colours on a heading for Durban. Observation revealed the escort to be light, and the commodore ordered an attack. Before our ships could properly close with the enemy, however, they were reinforced by two destroyers. A fighting retreat was ordered and was executed successfully.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the destroyers in question turned out to be not South African navy, as was assumed, but American. A fact that was revealed only after our forces opened fire on them. Our admirals assure us that the US vessels couldn't possibly have taken much damage from our ships at that range, but the Americans are construing the incident as an overt attack on their navy in what seems a transparent attempt to stoke tensions. According to our sources in the country, the administration of President [USA.GetPresidentLastName] has been trying to escalate their involvement in the war for some time, and this 'incident' might've provided them just the pretext they needed."

Soon after, we believe American soldiers and airmen will follow, to stand shoulder to shoulder with the damnable South Africans.\n\nWhile our superior doctrines, will and fighting spirit will surely win us the war regardless of their interference, the arrival of the Americans will give our enemies a big boost in manpower and morale in the short term, drag out the conflict and increase the cost of our inevitable victory."

This most recent development now puts that fear to rest for the foreseeable future. Our adversaries had been foolishly hoping for the Americans to come and rescue them, not understanding that a degenerate society such as theirs could never muster the courage needed to make a significant intervention. Their disappointment now will surely be a blow to the morale of their fighting men. While our ultimate victory was always assured, it now seems a little closer than yesterday."
