 POLITICS_OLEKSANDR_SHUMSKYI_DESC:0 "To the likes of a man such as Oleksandr Yakovych Shumskyi, life is always an uphill battle. In every corner, those who opposed him would always stand in his way, and facing them was a life long uphill battle of ideals and ideologies, and the hill was not an easy one to climb. Unlike many others in his time, he was a man of action, not just words, and was sick of politicians and bureaucrats babbling about their ideal world, Shumskyi was the only one bold enough to turn his words into action.\n\nFor a Ukrainian boy born into a minor noble home, a dull future seemed upsettingly inevitable. He studied in the city of Moscow, and instead of finding life dull, he found the key to his future through revolutionary politics. Perhaps that is what pressured Shumskyi into pursuing another life, or perhaps it was destiny for a man like Shumskyi, and it would certainly seem to be something of destiny for any soldier or orator of such skill. Fortunately for the people of Ukraine, Shumskyi is both.\n\nHaving fought for the Revolution against the Whites, and then against the Germans since they first stepped foot into Ukrainian soil, Oleksandr Shumskyi has dedicated every moment of his life not only for the Ukrainian revolution, but for the Ukrainian people. Since his first clashes with Bukharin for Ukrainianization projects to be carried through, not to mention his constant pushes for a Ukrainian Home Army which have only been a blessing since, many regard Shumskyi as the Lion which has saved not only Ukraine from total Russian or German domination, but the savior of Ukrainian culture.\n\nOf course, this position can only last for so long, before the Germans come back to tread on Ukrainian soil once more, and they return to lock the chain around the collective Ukrainian neck. If anyone can put a stop to such a thing happening again, however, it is Oleksandr Shumskyi."
