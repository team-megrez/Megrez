 POLITICS_SUKARNO_DESC:0 "The father of the Indonesian nation, and the leader in its struggle for Independence: all this, and more, can be used to characterize Sukarno, the President of the Indonesian Republic. While the reality, as often, is slightly more complicated, such a description is however not that far from the truth.\n\nWhile dealings with the Japanese were needed to safeguard the young nation's independence, a quick glance at it today will show that the benefits have far outweighed the costs: Sukarno stands as the President of a proud and rapidly-rising nation, who could in a few years rival the world's largest powers in terms of economic might, a task as daring as it seems daunting.\n\nYears have passed, however, and the Equatorial Emerald's President faces rumblings of discontent. Centralization from Java, its most prosperous island, is not unanimously popular, and the Indonesian army becomes more and more of a breeding ground for polarization and radicalism. Sukarno is not afraid in the least, for he knows the masses' respect and adoration towards him.\n\nWith the mandate of its people, and the strength of its President, Indonesia shall soar to new heights, and never again shall it be enslaved."

 FIELD_MARSHAL_SUHARTO:0 "Commander Suharto of the Indonesian Army is the second most powerful and third most influential man in the entire country. Quickly rising through the ranks during the National Revolution, Suharto became an integral part of the military and constructed a minor powerbase around himself. Filled with ambition, he makes every attempt to advise President Sukarno, much to the chagrin of Vice President Hatta, who opposes him at every turn. Where exactly Suharto's ambition will take him is anyone's guess, but everyone expects, or fears, that he will do whatever it takes to get there."
 FIELD_MARSHAL_ABDUL_HARIS_NASUTION:0 "Commander Abdul Haris Nasution is feared for his brutality among the rebel forces of Indonesia and even his own troops, and rightfully so.

It was the politics of it all that had ripped him from his life of luxury, it was the ideology that would turn the streets red with blood.

The gentle yet harrowing breeze of the wind accompanied the deafening silence between the two men.\n\n\"Sir I'm sorry, again, we appreciate you volunteering on this mission, but if you-\"\n\n\"But if I what? Sergeant?\" The captain broke his gaze from the sea, and his eyes met the sergeant's as he raised his voice with a deep Australian accent, \"If I am too cowardly for this assignment? You yanks asked for a bloody volunteer, and this old wanker is what you get!\" Green tried to calm himself down, failing, and continued his rant, \"I will personally see to it that the bullets from these guns meet a fucking Japanese's head.\"\n\n\"Please sir, calm down!\" The sergeant's eyes darted around the empty docks, paranoid, \"you're going to compromise the mission!\" Green obliged, but he was still livid that the sergeant doubted his resolve.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Green was it? I have my own reasons to make this trip.\" The captain stared off into the horizon once more.\n\nThe sergeant looked down, pensive, and walked away from the edge of the dock.

The group broke to small laughter, with even the sergeant himself letting out a chuckle. It made sense, Doe had never gone to active combat before, and imagining being seasick didn't make him feel any better.\n\n\"Hey, private,\" called the sergeant to the frowning Doe, \"Don't worry, it's just a routine assignment. Most of the ships that went arrived safe and sound on the other side, don't let the others get on your nerves.\" He tried to convince the private to calm down.\n\n\"Most, sir?\" He asked, \"This isn't any usual mission. In the middle of the ocean, there is nowhere for us to run if things go awry.\"\n\n\"Then we don't run, Private,\" the sergeant had calmed Doe down, \"Remember your training, it will help you when you need it.\" It was odd, Doe thought, for a sergeant to be nice to him instead of the usual screams that he put up with during training.

It's kind of refreshing really if you don't think of what the hell is happening on these islands.\" The captain frowned in disgust as he spoke that last sentence.

He's your age, maybe a little rougher around the edges. once you got to know 'em, y'all would be inseparable.\"\n\n\"Where is he then, your son?\" The private continued, noticing the captain's dreary expression.\n\n\"Christ, stop busting my balls here kid I got a job to do.\" The captain was taken aback by the remark.\n\n\"I'm sorry sir, didn't mean no harm,\" Doe replied apologetically.\n\n\"Hey, look at those lights,\" Doe tried to avert the conversation, \"what do you reckon is going on there?

And even when they allied with the Republicans, Edward did not jump ship, and stayed faithfully by the side of the true party of American conservatism. However, things had been... different, recently.

Despite being a Yockey, he had a few good points, Edward thought: his remarks on the total and utter incompetence on the part of the Republican-Democratic coalition weren't totally unfounded, far from it; in fact, it was probably the closest he had gotten to agreeing with a politician in a long time. Crommelin was saying things like they were, unlike the honeyed words of the Repblican-Democrats; and if Edward didn't agree with most of the Sovereigns' positions, he was beginning to think at, maybe, just maybe, they could guide America back to an honorable place on the world stage."

 INS_Djuanda_Kartawidjaja_hog_desc: "§YPrime Minister\nSocial Nationalism§!\n--------------\n§LIn a seemingly endless divide between the \"administrators\" and \"solidarity-makers\" in Indonesian politics, President Sukarno had deemed it appropriate to bridge the gap by appointing a cabinet for national peace. The man chosen to lead this eclectic mix of national heroes would be none other than technocrat Djuanda Kartawidjaja, a Sundanese civil engineer who benefited under the late Dutch \"Ethical Policy\" schools. Graduating from the Technische Hoogeschool de Bandoeng, Djuanda quickly became involved in the struggle for independence, and came to be known as a reliable workhorse in the nation's cabinets post-1949.\n\nHowever, his seemingly boundless energy seems to be coming at an end. Following the chaos of the Sidik, Natsir and Manai years, Djuanda was appointed by Sukarno following Hatta and Sjahrir's advice - primarily to centralise Japanese-built railways and rationalising the patchwork economy left behind by the Dutch and neglected by Japan's wartime needs. Djuanda has spent the last year exhausting the cabinet's capabilities alongside fellow technocrats Johannes Leimena and Roosseno, leaving diplomacy in a status quo with Japan.\n\nThe effort has bore fruit, as Djuanda has laid out the Eight-Years Development Plan. Taking advantage of the chaos in Indochina and the Philippines, Djuanda's cabinet has built the base for Indonesia to become Japan's prime outsourcing location for heavy industry in Southeast Asia. The future looks bright, but Djuanda's health does not. Only time will tell if he will live to see the full fruits of his labour, and that time is fading fast.§!"

Unlike the rest of his siblings, Leimena did not move in with his stepfather, after his own father died when he was five, and lived with his uncle's family. It was in youth did Leimena see the struggles of life and family, when he grew up during the strife in the 1920's and the growing resentment that the Indonesian people had against their Dutch overlords.\n\nGraduating from the STOVIA medical school, Leimena toiled in various hospitals throughout the nation in Djakarta and Bandung. When the Japanese came - and proved that they were here to stay - Leimena had become the Director of the hospitals in Purwakarta and Tangerang. Leimena, perhaps due to his vehement Christian upbringing, developed a fiercely anti-Communist atittude against those who he thought would persecute and destroy those who believed. Yet, in contrast, Leimena rejects the creed of their masters that occupy the Indonesian Archipelago as being \"for their own good\".\n\nWhat about the suffering that they've brought upon is good? The hunger? The poverty? The death? The only way that they could ever deliver any sort of gift upon Indonesia is letting go and creating an Indonesian state, ruled by Indonesians. It's this passion that has driven Leimena ever so near to the top, as Sukarno's top foreign minister. But it's this journey that has imparted upon the now aged soul some valuable lessons. Japan is a plague, but it is a plague that can be weaponised. If their millions and their foreign advisors come to our shores, maybe they can build up sorely-needed services such as healthcare and education, especially for those in the outer core of the country.

 INS_Roosseno_Surjohadikusumo_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Economy\nPaternalism§!\n--------------\n§LSukarno's coalition is long, wide-ranging and packed with figures and individuals who, in another world, could have been the arbiters of Indonesia's Destiny, in their own right. One of the most striking of these people is Roosseno - born Roosseno Soerjohadikoesoemo. A member of Hazairin's Technocratic faction, Rooosseno is a fervent firebrand that Indonesia must be ruled by those who know best, in order to uplift its most vulnerable and its most abused into a state of dignity and peace.\n\nAlongside the Technocrats, Rooseno flirts with the Corporatists inside Sukarno's Indonesia, who demand that the country should be reorganised in order to destroy the possibility of class conflict and even the remote chance that Communists would seize on the disorder and attempt a general uprising against the government. Roosseno is an engineer. Like any good engineer, his job is to find out what is wrong with the country, find the easiest and most efficient way to fix said problem and make sure that it never happens again. In his case? The scourge of foreign domination, both from Washington and Tokyo alike, creeps across the Archipelago threatening what sovereignty they have under the Japanese yoke.\n\nIndonesia is a project - just like any other. The foundations have already been built for it to become a truly glorious nation. All that's needed is for a strong, guiding hand to finish it to the end.§!"

When his father died at 13, and he was raised by a single mother, Supeno threw himself whole-heartedly into the world of cricket, football, martial arts and scouting. A charismatic leader even then, when the Japanese first landed on Indonesian shores and ousted the Dutch colonisers, Supeno was elected as his high school's student leader inside the Student Council.\n\nIt was only natural that he came to lead men, much like himself. Joining the Pembela Tanah Air - or the Voluntary Defenders of the Homeland - a Japanese-organised and ran paramilitary force designed to assist the IJA in fighting off what remains of resistance still lay inside the Archipelago, it was here that Bambang Supeno tasted War for the first time. Dirty, blood and grime-encrusted and terrible, Supeno understood that in warfare, you can use the most high-tech weapons and bombs - they mean nothing if the men holding it don't know their place in the annals of History.\n\nIt was the fighting during both the awesome clash that was the Second World War and the National Revolution that convinced Bambang Supeno of a simple idea. Why shouldn't the military have more of a say in politics? Why condemn those who gave all they had in service of the Motherland, just because it doesn't conform to the rule of a few, pampered bureaucrats. Thousands sacrificed themselves in the most brutal war ever waged in these islands - their comrades should at least decide how they're remembered.§!"
