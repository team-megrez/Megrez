 HNN_changsha_monastery_tour: "후난 수도원 관광"
 HNN_changsha_monastery_tour_desc: "While we endeavour to bring Buddhism to Hunan, we must also consider the often turbulent politics of the monasteries. We must ensure they remain fully under our control and respect the neutrality of the state in their internal affairs. To even start on the path towards that goal, ranking officials should first tour and assess all Buddhist monasteries in the country."
 HNN_imprison_landlords: "지주 투옥"
 HNN_imprison_landlords_desc: "As was expected, many among the landed elite resent our policies aimed at protecting their workers. Our most vocal opponents, even those whose work we once promised to secure, should be imprisoned and their estates redistributed among their farmhands."

If we are to throw our lot in with theirs, we must have assurances."
 HNN_join_zhili: "직예군벌과의 제휴"
 HNN_join_zhili_desc: "While Zhao Hengti was once a close acquaintance of leader figures within the Federalist movement, events have required that Hunan be ruled in a manner at odds with Federalist ideals. As such, ties between Zhao, and especially He Jian, and the Zhili Clique should be rekindled. Let us seek an alliance."

This reform will be implemented against all odds, and we won't hesitate to challenge conservative monks if necessary."
 HNN_Affinities_Amongst_People: "현대불교교리 설파"
 HNN_Affinities_Amongst_People_desc: "Traditional Buddhist ideas tended to reinforce unequal social relations. Modern Buddhism is a social religion fighting for the oppressed. We must push a new doctrine to our people and preach the values of greater unity."

 HNN_All_the_Joy_in_the_World_desc: "True joy means to appreciate others and to be delighted by their wellbeing. All possess a spring of joy within, and the more deeply one drinks of this spring, the better for one's own abundant happiness, and the more bountiful it becomes to relish the joy of others.

 HNN_Solve_the_Landlord_Problem_desc: "Corrupt landlords have long exploited their tenants, milking them of money and denying them their wellbeing. It is imperative that the province deals with this.

 HNN_Support_Local_Universities: "지방대학 지원"
 HNN_Support_Local_Universities_desc: "Education in Hunan is still in a dire situation. We should open up 'local universities' for peasants. These universities, converted from local temples and staffed mostly by monks, should serve as a means to significantly reduce illiteracy."

We must now aid them, to improve their social status, to end the entrenched poverty that has gripped them. Peasants, workers, businessmen, students and soldiers are all for Buddhism."
 HNN_The_Gender_Issue: "여성문제"
 HNN_The_Gender_Issue_desc: "Traditionally, Buddhism viewed women as inferior and inclined to carnal desires. However, this is untrue, Buddha recognises the difference between two sexes, but is all for equality between men and women.

 HNN_Provincial_Curriculum: "성 교육과정"
 HNN_Provincial_Curriculum_desc: "We must reform our curriculum to fit Buddhist Socialism and create a more effective way to teach and learn.

 HNN_Clamp_Down_on_Dissent: "반대의견 단속"
 HNN_Clamp_Down_on_Dissent_desc: "Zhao Hengti had kept company from across the political spectrum, including any who would be his ally.

These men must be removed."
 HNN_Purge_the_Socialists: "사회주의자 숙청"
 HNN_Purge_the_Socialists_desc: "Socialism threatens to infect the people with its lies and malicious intentions. With socialism there can be no compromise. Let us eliminate by force any and all openly socialist political organisations."

 HNN_Provincial_Stability_desc: "The socialists have been destroyed, and with them, many organs of popular dissent. Quarterlies, village loudmouths, and the like have all been silenced.

 HNN_Drive_out_Federalism: "청첸 지지자 몰아내기"
 HNN_Drive_out_Federalism_desc: "By the standards of the present KMT, Cheng Qian is quite the moderate. His advocacy, however, undermines our control in this most dangerous of times. Cheng, and those of his supporters who can most easily be captured, must be eliminated. Those Nationalists hiding away on the fringes shall receive justice in due time."
 HNN_Educate_the_People: "황스헝의 교육 계획"
 HNN_Educate_the_People_desc: "Huang Shiheng, a Western-educated bohemian of many talents, greatly improved Hunan Business School as president. A staunch supporter of our regime, we should implement his newly formulated plan to transform the education system."
 HNN_Satisfy_the_Workers: "노동자 만족시키기"
 HNN_Satisfy_the_Workers_desc: "Urban labour organisations could be a source of great instability if antagonised, or a wonderful boon if properly managed. By working closely with these groups, our regime shall be all the stronger."
 HNN_Under_the_Law: "법 앞의 평등"
 HNN_Under_the_Law_desc: "The many minority groups of Hunan fear the strong character of our regime. We must meet with local leaders to offer assurances for the protection of their communal integrity. We shall help all those who help us."
 HNN_Expel_Enemies: "자오헝티의 적 축출"
 HNN_Expel_Enemies_desc: "Those who still raise their fists against Zhao must be publicly expelled, made to walk across our frontier at gunpoint, their belongings in hand. This will surely cow many."
 HNN_Populist_Ways: "성리학 재부흥"
 HNN_Populist_Ways_desc: "Hunan is a centre of neo-Confucianism. Zeng Guofan revitalised neo-Confucianism to invoke the loyalty and combat spirit of our people. We should do the same by promoting neo-Confucian doctrines and reading classics to resist the corruption of modern culture."
 HNN_The_Spirit_of_Nationalism: "중화민족 정신"

 HNN_Foster_Patriotism_desc: "As but a province of China with considerably diversity, few identify solely as Hunanese. By stressing our place within the greater Chinese project and the values we aspire to, we can begin to at least cultivate patriotic feeling, if not a unified identity."
 HNN_The_Anti_Socialist_Campaign: "반사회주의운동"
 HNN_The_Anti_Socialist_Campaign_desc: "Socialism is an endless font of moral corruption. Indeed, perhaps even our greatest foes on the left could have been allies in some other world where they had not heard its siren song. To precipitate more targeted future campaigns, we must make the people aware of the wickedness of socialism."
 HNN_Guaranteed_Liberty: "개인의 자유 보장"
 HNN_Guaranteed_Liberty_desc: "Some accuse Zhao Hengti of holding authoritarian tendencies. With a basic charter of individual rights in hand, we shall prove these critics wrong."
 HNN_The_Rights_of_Man: "인간의 권리"
 HNN_The_Rights_of_Man_desc: "While not law per se, we should officially endorse a comprehensive list of general rights to be afforded to the people of Hunan. This should serve as a robust moderating force on any future would-be dictator."

 HNN_The_Question_of_Women: "Empower Hunanese Women"
 HNN_The_Question_of_Women_desc: "Traditionally, women are expected to stay at home, but this practice does not fit the demands of this day and age. Auxiliary roles and positions in factories and workshops should be filled be the nation's patriotic women, freeing men for service on the frontlines."
 HNN_Zun_Lao: "새로운 효도"
 HNN_Zun_Lao_desc: "Filial Piety, or Xiao, is the pillar of our society.

In the end, we are all children of Hunan, and we will protect it together!"

 HNN_Align_with_the_Leftists: "좌파와의 동맹"
 HNN_Align_with_the_Leftists_desc: "While Cheng Qian is something of a moderate, those still loyal to the KMT have taken a sharp turn to the left. We must embrace this development."

 HNN_Study_Sanmin_Zhuyi: "삼민주의 학습"
 HNN_Study_Sanmin_Zhuyi_desc: "Minzu - a uniquely Chinese nationalism, Minquan - popular empowerment, and Minsheng - popular welfare, these are the Three Principles of the People. Laid down by Sun Yat-sen, they guide the Kuomintang to this day, often inspiring a near-religious fervour. We must encourage the study of this great ideology, perhaps to the point of the bureaucratic examinations of old."
 HNN_Our_Own_Path: "우리 스스로의 길"

 HNN_Improve_Farmer_Livelihoods: "농민의 생계 개선"
 HNN_Improve_Farmer_Livelihoods_desc: "While many politicians focus on the demands of the cities, most of China remains rural. To secure the people's hearts and minds, we must also ensure farmers can survive times of hardship. When prices fall, the government should pick up the slack."
 HNN_Social_Welfare_Program: "사회복지 계획"
 HNN_Social_Welfare_Program_desc: "The scope and nature of social welfare is evolving rapidly. While European nations now offer robust pension programmes and services, such are not present anywhere in China.

 HNN_Religious_Unity: "조화를 위한 봉사"
 HNN_Religious_Unity_desc: "Mixed regiments during a time of crisis were a great boon for the Xiang army. Our expanding party apparatus has become increasingly factionalised, and to combat that, we should look to the Xiang model.

 HNN_Education_Reform: "교육개혁"
 HNN_Education_Reform_desc: "Members of Zhao Hengti's government made ambitious promises towards academia. We cannot allow this insidious influence to undermine our rule. We must institute broad education reforms and invest greatly in the sector to combat the influence of his cronies."

 HNN_Enforce_Democracy: "민주주의 강요"
 HNN_Enforce_Democracy_desc: "Democracy must also permeate the workplace. We shall enshrine in law that workers in each individual shop and factory should elect their own overseers and managers.

 HNN_Attract_Foreign_Investment: "광둥성 자본가 유치"
 HNN_Attract_Foreign_Investment_desc: "Hunan is rich in resources and manpower, but direly lacking in investment. With the breakdown of the League of Eight Provinces, we have greater autonomy to boost our economic development. It's time to turn our political ties to Guangdong into economic gains."
 HNN_Reform_the_Status_Quo: "섬유산업 살리기"
 HNN_Reform_the_Status_Quo_desc: "The textile industry in Changsha faces great financial difficulty. We can't afford to let it shrink down. We have to use provincial protectionism to save our industry."

 HNN_The_Arsenals_of_the_South_desc: "Hu Shuhua, a metallurgist serving in the provincial government, has submitted a detailed report on Hunan's great potential to develop heavy industry.

 HNN_Subsidies_to_Military_Industry_desc: "Zhuzhou, a city along the Xiang River and the Guangzhou-Wuchang railway, has been chosen as the site for an ambitious development plan, thanks to its industrial potential.

The times ahead are turbulent ones - Tang Shengming, the brother of Tang Shengzhi, is making attempts to bring his brother back to Hunan and into power once again. Cheng Qian, a supporter of the KMT and a commander in the NRA, also looks to take over the province.\n\nTo the south is the Liangguang Clique, led by Chen Jiongming. Even though Zhao Hengti claims to be a federalist, Chen shows it. To the west are the Cliques of Sichuan and Yunnan, eyeing us with hungry looks.

 hnn.28.d: "A riot occurred today in Changsha. It started as a normal protest, but after a spat between a Constitutionalist and a Provincial Council member escalated too far, a full-on riot broke out, with people raising and lowering their hands repeatedly. The local army was sent in, managing to push back the rioters down the streets and putting a temporary end to the chaos."
 hnn.28.a: "젠장, 통제해야만 한다!"
 hnn.29.t: "거리에서의 폭력"
 hnn.29.d: "이번주에도 청더와 창사에 또 시위의 물결이 들이닥쳤고 그 중 한 곳에서는 유혈사태까지 벌어졌습니다. 한 경비병이 청더 시위대를 상대로 발포했고, 그 모습을 본 군중이 이성을 잃어버리면서 폭도와 경비대 사이에 거의 전면전에 가까운 전투가 벌어졌습니다. 양쪽 모두에서 사상자가 발생했습니다. 지난 한 주 간 시위는 더욱 폭력적으로 변화했고 심각한 부상자가 나오기 시작했으며, 심지어 일부 사건에서는 사망자까지 나왔습니다. 날이 갈수록 성에 질서를 회복하고 시위하는 사람들을 막기 힘들어져가고 있습니다."
 hnn.29.a: "오늘도 위안강이 붉게 물드는구나..."
 hnn.30.t: "군사 반란!"
 hnn.30.d: "This morning, under the banner of the Buddhist General, much of our military has declared a revolt! They have set their provisional capital in Changde, while forces loyal to Zhao Hengti are beginning to flock to the frontlines. Major battles are predicted to start shortly, as the province is plunged into chaos."
 hnn.30.a: "이건 좋지 않아..."
 hnn.31.t: "펑황 전투"
 hnn.31.d: "구이저우 동쪽 경계선 바로 옆에 위치한 펑황시에서 양군이 전투를 벌이고 있습니다. 자오헝티의 민병대가 도시에 돌입했고 사방에서 총성이 난무하는 가운데 탕성즈에게 충성을 바치는 병사들은 용맹하게 방어전을 펼치는 중입니다."
 hnn.31.a: "탕성즈가 방어하는데 성공했다!"
 hnn.31.b: "자오헝티가 도시를 차지했다!"
 hnn.32.t: "창사 전투"
 hnn.32.d: "펑황에서 승리를 거둔 반란군은 자오헝티의 근거지 창사를 확보하기 위해 이동했습니다. 반란군이 거리를 활보하고 성장의 자택에 날이 갈수록 접근하면서 도시는 며칠간 혼란에 빠졌습니다. 긴장이 고조되고 토지는 피로 물들었습니다. 반군이 이긴다면 자오헝티 정권이 종말에 이르게 될지도 모릅니다."
 hnn.32.a: "The rebels win!"
 hnn.32.b: "The loyalists push the rebels out!"
 hnn.33.t: "창더 전투"
 hnn.33.d: "펑황에서 상처뿐인 승리를 거둔 이후 자신감과 부대를 다시 정비한 자오헝티는 반군의 심장부 청더를 공격할 때가 되었다고 판단했습니다. 이미 일련의 소규모 접전과 전투가 벌어졌고 대포 쏘는 소리가 하늘을 가득 채웠습니다. 반란군이 패배할 가능성이 높아 보입니다."
 hnn.33.a: "탕성즈가 도시를 방어해냈다!"
 hnn.33.b: "자오헝티가 승리했다!"
 hnn.34.t: "헝양 전투"
 hnn.34.d: "일련의 접전이 지나고 한 파벌의 수도를 점령하려는 시도가 실패로 끝난 이후 반란은 마지막 단계에 다다랐습니다. 양측 모두가 마침내 전군을 이끌고 자오헝티의 고향인 헝양에서 마주쳤습니다. 양군이 끌어낸 모든 부대를 투입한 이곳이 이번 반란의 마지막 전장이 될 지도 모릅니다.  이 전투가 호남의 운명을 결정할 것이며, 둘 중 승리하는 이가 호남을 이끌게 될 것입니다."
 hnn.34.a: "탕성즈가 승리를 거두었다!"
 hnn.34.b: "자오헝티가 반군을 격파했다!"
 hnn.36.t: "이양 전투"
 hnn.36.d: "An important junction between the two cities of Changsha and Changde, the bases of Zhao Hengti and Tang Shengzhi, respectively, Yiyang has been attacked by the rebels. Tang Shengzhi and a few divisions have laid siege to the city and are currently bombarding the loyalist defences. Zhao Hengti, hearing these news, has quickly commanded his generals to send a relief force. However, there are fears that the force will not arrive in time, and that Tang Shengzhi will take over the city, bringing him one step closer to Changsha."
 hnn.36.a: "탕성즈가 방어선을 돌파했다!"
 hnn.36.b: "증원군이 도착했다!"
 hnn.37.t: "사오양 전투"
 hnn.37.d: "Shaoyang, a city in the middle of Hunan, has come under attack by the Buddhist General's forces. From Shaoyang, Tang could possibly expand his power to the city of Hengyang and capture southern Hunan, severing our connections with Liangguang and cornering us in the North. He may also gain control of important roads leading to important cities such as Changsha. It is imperative that Zhao Hengti keep the city if he wishes to survive."
 hnn.37.a: "탕성즈가 충성파를 쫓아냈다!"
 hnn.37.b: "자오헝티가 반군을 몰아냈다!"
 hnn.38.t: "화이화 공격"
 hnn.38.d: "호남 서부에 위치한 도시 화이화는 현재 불교 장군 탕성즈의 통제 아래에 있습니다. 성장은 전선을 돌파하고 화이화 시를 손에 넣기 위해 한 개 부대를 파견했습니다. 청더와 북부에 공격을 감행하고 남부에 위치한 불교 장군의 부대와 차단하기 위해서는 그 도시를 거점으로 삼을 필요가 있습니다. 도시는 잘 방어되어 있으며 전투가 임박했습니다. 누가 승리했을까요?"
 hnn.38.a: "공격이 실패했다!"
 hnn.38.b: "공격이 성공했다!"
 hnn.39.t: "둥팅호를 가로질러"
 hnn.39.d: "Dongting Lake is a large lake in the north of Hunan, after which Hunan is named; \"hú\" means lake, referring to Dongting Lake, and \"nán\" means south - thus, Hunan means \"south of (Dongting) Lake\". If we are able to cross it, it may provide us with a huge tactical advantage over the rebels and take us closer to Changde. Boats are to be built and sent out into the lake to contest its current dominance by Tang Shengzhi. The objective is to secure coastal villages and hold out."
 hnn.39.a: "호수를 손에 넣을 것이다!"
 hnn.40.t: "위안장강 상류"
 hnn.40.d: "원강은 둥팅호에서 청더를 거쳐 흐르는 강입니다. 현재 우리가 호수에 충분한 지배력을 행사하고 있으니, 강을 활용해야 합니다. 아군 병사들이 강변에 위치한 정착지를 습격하고 청더에 혼란을 일으킨 이후 창사로 되돌아오려는 목적으로 작은 배에 올라탔습니다."
 hnn.40.a: "행운을 빈다."
 hnn.41.t: "창더 습격"
 hnn.41.d: "성공입니다! 아군 병사들이 강 상류로 거슬러 올라가 청더를 습격했고 귀중한 서류와 정보 그리고 돈을 가지고 왔습니다. 여러 좋은 인재를 잃었지만, 탈출하는데 성공한 이들이 전달해준 것들은 귀중한 것들입니다."
 hnn.41.a: "위대한 성취로다!"
 hnn.42.t: "습격 실패"
 hnn.42.d: "Ou men have been captured and gunned down by the Buddhist General's forces in Changde. It seems they were expecting an attack up the river, and they sprung a trap, encircling our soldiers and forcing them to surrender."
 hnn.42.a: "너희들은 선택받은 이들이었다!"
 hnn.43.t: "수상쩍은 음모"
 hnn.43.d: "군 장교들이 오늘 회의를 열었는데, 성장 정권을 전복시키려는 음모를 꾸미는 모습을 엿들은 이가 있었습니다. 성장 사무실에 보고가 들어갔지만 그는 조용히 고개를 끄덕이면서 언젠가 이런 일이 벌이질 줄 알았다고 말할 뿐이었습니다. 임시성장은 크게 걱정하지 말라는 지시를 내렸지만, 성장이 위험을 과소평가하고 있다는 우려도 제기되었습니다..."
 hnn.43.a: "별일 없을거야... 맞지?"
 hnn.44.t: "Tang Shengzhi denounces Zhao Hengti"
 hnn.44.d: "The Buddhist General has once again spoken out, now with much fiercer anger against the Governor. He spoke from a balcony in Changde with thousands of people watching him as he listed the many things he accused the current provincial government of. He was seen flanked by his brother, Tang Shengming, among other members of the military. Many concerns have been raised that the general has connections with the plot against Zhao Hengti."

 hnn.46.d: "탕성즈가 또 다시 호남을 완전히 손에 넣었습니다. 오늘 아침 탕성즈와 그 동료들이 성장의 자택에 들어닥쳐 성장을 쫓아냈고 탕성즈가 새로운 성장에 취임했습니다. 자오헝티는 성 경계선을 넘어 북직예군벌이 지배하는 후페이로 도망쳤습니다. 탕성즈는 자신이 주장하던 '불교 사회주의'를 확장시키기 시작했습니다. 호남은 탕성즈의 아래에서 더 좋을지 더 나쁠지는 아직 모르겠지만, 아무튼 새로운 시대를 맞게 될 것입니다. 일단 지금으로서는 그가 하는 행보를 가만히 지켜볼 수 밖에 없습니다."
 hnn.46.a: "성장은 떠나갔다. 새 성장 만세!"
 hnn.47.t: "탕성즈의 혁명적 불교"
 hnn.47.d: "신임 성장 탕성즈는 자신의 새로운 이념을 또 다시 호남 사회에 투사했습니다. '혁명적 불교'라고 불리는 이 이념은 탕성즈 성장이 수많은 이념이 가진 최고의 장점만을 얻어내기 위해 쏟아부은 노력의 결과물입니다. 그는 국민당 사회주의자들과 그들이 주장하는 평등주의에서, 호국전쟁과 그 과정에서 보여진 애국주의에서, 그리고 자신과 동지들이 지키던 불교사상에서 큰 영감을 받았습니다. 탕성즈는 이 모든 요소를 하나로 합쳐 완벽한 자신만의 이념을 만들어냈습니다.\n\n일부 독실한 불교도들과 우익 지지자들은 그의 이념에 반대하지만, 대부분의 호남 사람들은 그의 이념이 성을 현대화할 가장 정당한 방향이라고 믿기 때문에 혁명적 불교를 수용했습니다. 호남이 다시 한번 중국이라는 무대에 모습을 드러내기 위해서는 가장 먼저 혁명화해야 합니다."
 hnn.47.a: "불교를 위하여! 혁명을 위하여!"
 hnn.48.t: "지주 문제"
 hnn.48.d: "호남에는 꽤 논쟁적인 문제가 남아있습니다. 국내 지주들을 어떻게 처리해야 하느냐는 문제입니다. 탕성즈가 사회주의자인 만큼 이 문제를 효과적으로 처리할 방법을 알아야 합니다. 저들을 처리하는 방법은 크게 세 가지가 있습니다. 그냥 죽여버리거나, 평범한 농부 열명분의 무거운 노동형을 부과하거나, 그냥 놓아주고 다시는 돌아오지 말라고 말하는 것입니다. 장군은 어떤 방법을 선택했을까요?"
 hnn.48.a: "다 죽여버려!"
 hnn.48.b: "노동하게 만들어라!"
 hnn.48.c: "자유롭게 놓아줘라!"
 hnn.49.t: "여성 문제"
 hnn.49.d: "여성은 우리 인구의 많은 부분을 차지하고 있습니다. 호남 성인 여성 대부분은 단순한 농부거나 아니면 주부이며, 발언권을 전혀 가지지 못하고 있습니다. 하지만 영향력 있는 여성들이 대도시에 위치한 공장에서 더 많이 일하게 해서 여성들의 지위를 높여야 한다는 자신들의 주장을 밀어붙이기 시작했습니다. 그들은 남성과 같은 노동 임금을 요구하고 여성에 대한 차별을 일소해야 한다고 주장합니다. 하지만 여성에게 자신이 가진 권력의 많은 부분을 넘겨주고 싶지 않았던 지역 남성들과 성 의회에서 많은 반대 의견이 나오고 있습니다. 그들은 자신의 위치와 가능한 한 최대한 남성의 사회 경제적 우세를 지키고자 합니다. 평등을 약속한다면 여성에게는 좋겠지만, 호남의 남성들을 확실히 분노케 만들 것입니다. 어떻게 대답해야 할까요?"
 hnn.49.a: "지금 당장 사회적 경제적 평등을 제공해라!"

 hnn.50.d: "오늘, 탕성즈는 고향 둥안현 인근에 새로운 중등학교를 개교하고 아버지의 이름을 따 '요상학원' 이라고 이름붙일 것이라고 발표했습니다. 당초 대학 설립을 목표로 추진되었던 이 학교는 이사회를 두지 않고 탕성즈를 이사장으로, 구처우를 교장으로 둘 예정입니다. 요상학원은 상대적으로 부유한 학생들을 교육할 목적으로 세워진 사립학교입니다. 그 외에는 뭔가 특별한 목적성을 가지고 있지는 않습니다. 개교일은 내년으로 예정되어 있습니다."
 hnn.50.a: "교육 향상을 위한 의미있는 시도로다!"
 hnn.51.t: "수도원에서의 시위"
 hnn.51.d: "Some Buddhist monasteries in Hunan have expressed outrage at Tang Shengzhi's new Buddhisisation programme, claiming that it took away their way of life and adapted their religion to a harmful political agenda. Tang Shengzhi responded to these monks by saying 'Buddhism is nothing without socialism or politics. If you're concerned about politics being involved in religion, you should look at the Western provinces.'"
 hnn.51.a: "They probably didn't like that response..."
 hnn.52.t: "지대 수금군"
 hnn.52.d: "It has come to the attention of the Provincial Government of Hunan that local landlords have been hiring members of the military to collect rent and evict their tenants for a cut of the rent money. This goes without saying as a severe transgression against the ideals of Buddhist Socialism, and with unanimous agreement from the Provincial Council, the military is to be told to stand down and stop its interference with landowners."
 hnn.52.a: "These pesky landlords are up to no good!"
 hnn.53.t: "Military Rent Collectors stand down"
 hnn.53.d: "With the order coming through from Changsha that all members of the military who engaged in the collecting of rent and eviction of tenants to cease their actions, most of the military personnel who engaged in rent collection stopped. They were either demoted or punished, and those who refused the order were stripped of their rank and arrested."
 hnn.53.a: "People will do anything for a little money..."
 hnn.54.t: "무기 밀수 보고서"
 hnn.54.d: "The North-South railway going through Hunan is being used extensively for the transport of cargo, and among it, weapons. These weapons are transported illegally to and from Guangxi, Guangdong, the Foreign Concessions, and the government in Beijing. There is now hot debate in the Provincial Council as to what to do with these illegal arms smugglers. Many members have stated that they do not care about the situation, and some urge governor Tang Shengzhi to take action immediately and crack down on the smugglers. The choice is ultimately his - what do we do with the illegal arms trade?"
 hnn.54.a: "Starting with the next cargo train that passes through, we must crack down on this at once!"
 hnn.54.b: "Leave them be, as long as they pay the transport fee they'll be fine."
 hnn.55.t: "샹장 사건"
 hnn.55.d: "Local reports of suspicious boats on the Xiangjiang were never a matter of importance to the police. However, after a large gunfight in Changde, leaving around a dozen dead and many more wounded involving these boats, the local police force has started to investigate more into these strange barges. Many say that the boats are just regular ones, and that the participants of the gunfight should be apprehended, but some claim that the gunfight and the marked boats are examples of something bigger."
 hnn.55.a: "I'm sure it's nothing - arrest the troublesome ones and we'll be done with this."
 hnn.55.b: "This calls for an investigation!"
 hnn.56.t: "대규모 아편밀수단 적발"
 hnn.56.d: "The investigation of the strange, marked boats and the gunfight on the Xiangjiang River have led to the discovery of a massive illegal opium smuggling ring which has operated under the nose of the Provincial Government for years. Even though the Provincial Government does not care much about the use of opium, the fact that this smuggling ring has continuously avoided taxation has made the Provincial Government agree that this smuggling ring should be stopped. Operating within Hunan, Sichuan, and Yunnan, this ring is notorious for running from the law and defying local authority."
 hnn.56.a: "This must be put to an end at once!"
 hnn.57.t: "일관도 집회"
 hnn.57.d: "A recent rural Yiguandao rally has turned the public eye to this strange religion. With an old 'Master' holding the rally, members of the Yiguandao tried to spread the word of the Yiguandao across the countryside of Hunan. The cult has been rejected by many farmers and peasants as crazy, but many other also started becoming devout followers. There is now hot debate about the Yiguandao and its possible effects on the province, with many citing the Yiguandao in Shandong, where they are perhaps one of the most powerful forces in the province."
 hnn.57.a: "This cult is a strange one."
 hnn.58.t: "Opium Smuggling Ring discovered in Southern China"
 hnn.58.d: "An illegal opium smuggling ring has just been discovered by the provincial government of Hunan. They have operated under the noses of the governors of Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, and eastern provinces along the Yangtze for many years, consistently evading taxation. Governor Tang Shengzhi of Hunan has dedicated himself in the past week to destroy this smuggling ring, or at least to make it pay taxes. Whatever the case, ceasing the evasion of taxes by this group will help us financially."
 hnn.58.a: "Good work, Tang!"
 hnn.59.t: "자오헝티의 조작을 통한 선거 승리"
 hnn.59.d: "The election was so deeply fraudulent that the results were all but discarded. Zhao Hengti has been re-elected on flimsy grounds. While Tang Shengzhi and Cheng Qian may protest, the duration of the election gave Zhao Hengti sufficient time to cement his rule. Tang Shengzhi, worryingly, has fled from the province with some of his closest advisors in tow."
 hnn.59.a: "Victory!"
 hnn.590.t: "자오헝티가 반란을 진압하다"
 hnn.590.d: "Zhao Hengti and his men have walked into Changde, ousting Tang Shengzhi and the generals loyal to him, most of whom, if not all have fled on a train to neighbouring Sichuan, where they will lie low amidst the chaos. The rebellion is over, and Tang Shengzhi has fled from the province. The Governor has called a great feast to be held tonight, with his loyalist generals, to celebrate the end of the hard-fought but short rebellion. A new age will begin for Hunan under Governor Zhao Hengti."
 hnn.590.a: "He's gone for good this time."
 hnn.60.t: "탕성즈 사냥"
 hnn.60.d: "The initial search for Tang Shengzhi has failed to turn up any leads. The team responsible for the search has begun to look further afield. It might be a while but surely we will find the traitor and bring him to trial."
 hnn.60.a: "Let's hope he hasn't fled too far."
 hnn.61.t: "홍콩에서 발견된 탕성즈"
 hnn.61.d: "After two months of searching, Tang Shengzhi has been identified in Hong Kong. A team has been assembled to drag him back to Hunan in chains."
 hnn.61.a: "Bring him back, and we will put him on trial."
 hnn.62.t: "탕성즈 재판"
 hnn.62.d: "While two of our men were shot in Hong Kong in the process, Tang Shengzhi has been brought back to Hunan in chains. A show trial has been prepared and he stands accused of treason. While our rule is secure, Tang Shengzhi remains popular and executing him might leave a number of people quite upset."
 hnn.62.a: "Death to the traitor!"
 hnn.62.b: "Exile him!"
 hnn.63.t: "자오헝티의 선거 승리"
 hnn.63.d_1: "While the voting was extremely close, in the end, Zhao Hengti won by a narrow margin. While some whisper that it was fraud which pushed him over the edge, throughout the election, Zhao was uncharacteristically restrained, and given time to cement his regime, none can openly challenge Zhao in the field."
 hnn.63.d_2: "While many expected Zhao Hengti to fraudulently affect the results of the Hunanese general election, by all accounts the election was mostly free and fair. Zhao has been re-elected governor nonetheless."
 hnn.63.a: "Victory!"
 hnn.64.t: "청첸의 선거 승리"
 hnn.64.d: "Cheng Qian and the KMT have won the election. Not willing to wait to assume the governorship, Cheng Qian all but chased Zhao Hengti from his residence. While many expect Cheng to bring Hunan under arms in support of the KMT in Longyang, he possesses a notorious independent streak."
 hnn.64.a: "Victory!"
 hnn.65.t: "호남의 길"
 hnn.65.d1: "With our victory secure, we must choose whether to align with the left or the less prominent right."
 hnn.65.d2: "The attempted Nationalist revolt in Longyang unfortunately failed before our rise to power in Hunan. With our victory secure, we must choose whether to align with the left or the less prominent right."
 hnn.65.a: "Conform to the party line."
 hnn.65.b: "Our own path - align with the right of the party."
 hnn.650.t: "Hunan Aligns with the Right"
 hnn.650.d: "While Cheng Qian only recently was a leading member of our party, following his victory in Hunan, he has officially proclaimed his desire to align with the discredited right. While perhaps some sort of arrangement may still yet be made between us, many see this as a betrayal."

 hnn.97.d: "Even though Black Monday did little to affect the inland provinces, Hunan was still hit by it. There was a significant economic downturn overnight, but it was not sufficiently damaging enough to destroy the economy. Hunan has been in a rather stable position for years now, with a relatively weak economy amongst the other Chinese provinces. Our main exports are rhubarb, musk, honey, tobacco, hemp, and birds, and we are an important producer of tea and ramie, both of which, under the League of Eight Provinces, were sold to the concessions. The provincial government must now use its abilities to improve our economy, do business with other powers in China, and set our province on the right path."
 hnn.97.a: "We must aim for a better economy."

 hnn.105.d: "General He Jian, the censor of Hunan under Zhao Hengti, has issued a unilateral ban over the book 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland', by author Lewis Carroll. He claims that the book's portrayal of anthropomorphised animals acting with no difference other than physically than human beings was an insult to the humanity. He further explains that children, when seeing humans and animals on the same level as each other, will start to regard them as so, something he described as having 'disastrous' consequences.\n\nSoldiers were commanded to throw away and burn any copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland they saw. Across the province, his action has been seen very poorly by local parents and children."

 HNN_tang_shengzhi_leader_desc: "Born in October 12th, 1889 and a native to Hunan, Tang Shengzhi has successfully clawed back power after over a decade. A graduate of Baoding military academy and a staunch Buddhist, Tang enjoyed a prominent role in Hunan's military before internal tensions resulted in his defection to the National Revolutionary Army during the Northern Expedition. There, he was appointed Governor for the KMT, but was ultimately driven out with the collapse of the NRA. Forced into exile, his brother's prominence and his shrewd political scheming has allowed for him to return to Hunan and successfully challenge sitting governor Zhao Hengti in elections.\n\nTriumphant, Tang now seeks to implement his version of Buddhist Socialism. His doctrine holds that Buddhism and socialism are identical, materialism and spiritualism are interconnected. This, however, hardly means he can take Buddhist support for granted, and to many his approaches to the faith are far too revolutionary. It remains to be seen if this so-called Buddhist general can truly transform Hunan for the better."

As Zhao emerged victorious in the 1921 election, he would bring Tang to prominence but this alliance would soon end with Tang growing jealous of Zhao's favouritism towards other military commands. Tang bided his time however, and saw his chance with the 1926 Northern Expedition. Joining up with the National Revolutionary Army, Tang ousted his former master and established his own administration under the auspices of the KMT. Deviating from his new bosses however, he began a Buddhisisation campaign, a syncretic Buddhist-Leftist programme. This would not last long however, before German intervention allowed for the Zhili government pushed out KMT forces from the region and brought Zhao back in tow. Tang fled to the concessions, where he would hide for several years in exile.\n\nThis was not the end however of Tang Shengzhi. Tang Shengming, his younger brother, proved popular enough to remain a general within the Hunan military and soon enough was able to rekindle support among the officers for Tang Shengzhi to return. Taking a risk, the older Tang returned to Hunan where Zhao proved too weak to order his arrest, instead opting to outmanoeuvre his old General in elections. Tang, for his part, has decided to take the political route as well - but regardless it is clear that his position in the military will be difficult to dislodge…"
 HNN_cheng_qian_leader_desc: "Cheng Qian was raised in a wealthy family of landlords and received a classic Confucian education. This allowed him to pass the civil service examination and study at Changsha's Yuelu Academy before switching over to a military career at Hunan Military Academy. Later, he would go to Japan for further studies, where he met budding leaders of the Tongmenghui. He would convert to their cause after meeting Sun Yat-sen, and after graduation from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, he would join the Xinhai revolution breaking out in 1911. A long-time KMT general, he would lead the NRA's invasion of Hunan during the Northern expedition and join the establishment of a provincial government under Tang Shengzhi. The failure of the expedition however, saw Cheng go into exile - at least until the emergence of a rebellion in Fujian. There he would again rise to prominence. However, with the announcement of a new election in Hunan, Cheng decided to go on leave from his post and contest the Governorship from sitting governor Zhao Hengti.\n\nWith Cheng emerging victorious in the election, he is now free to begin implementing the Three Principles of the People and the KMT programme in the province.

Although initially successful, the expedition would collapse with German intervention. Despite the elder Tang's exile from Hunan following the failure of the Northern Expedition and his Buddhist Socialist programme, Tang Shengming's rare ability to get along with virtually anybody resulted in him remaining in Hunan and even gaining a position of prominence within the Hunan military.

Although his family did not have much in the way of means, Peng would listen to his grandfather, a veteran of the Taiping rebellion, describe the ideals of social and economic equality. Initially able to go to a traditional Confucian school, his family's declining economic prosperity forced him to withdraw and beg for money to help support his family. After losing many of his family members to poverty, including his mother, he found himself working at a coal mine. It was around then that the Xinhai revolution broke out - and Peng found himself further destitute as the economy declined. He would join a local warlord army as an enlisted man and rise through the ranks - at one point his regiment joined with Tang Shengzhi's army. There Peng fought for Sun Yat-sen's forces against Wu Peifu's local allies. His attempt to join the Kuomintang in 1922 left him disillusioned however, and he initially returned home to become a farmer. Dissatisfied, he then applied to the Hunan military academy, taking on the name Dehuai. His regiment would initially back the Kuomintang during its invasion of Hunan, but Peng himself hesitated. This hesitation proved to be useful when the tide turned, and Peng successfully defected back to Zhili lines."

Tang Shengzhi would then take him under his wing, and He Jian would fight for the Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition. The collapse of the NRA in 1927, however, initially set him adrift but a general amnesty in Hunan for those who were willing to defect proved to be a fortuitous opportunity for many of Tang's subordinates. He Jian now finds himself in the service of the Hunan military, but it is widely speculated that his loyalties, as well as many others, remain with Tang rather than Zhao."

A friend of Chen Geng, he would initially flirt with the leftist part of the party, but the collapse of the Kuomintang in 1927 meant the future of the then 20 year old officer was drastically altered. Set adrift, he went to Japan to study for several years before returning home to Hunan to offer his services. There, he found plenty of old associates of Cheng Qian and the KMT serving in the Hunan army and was able to leverage his connections to slowly achieve a place of prominence in the regional forces."

Nonetheless, it would appear he had inherited some military skills from his father, a minor Qing officer, and at age 20 he began his long career as a guerilla leader after he killed a tax assessor out of revenge for the murder of his indebted uncle. Since then his legend as an outlaw and a Robin-hood figure has only grown, as He Long and his trusty signature knife built a local army right in time for the rise of the Kuomintang in 1920. A teacher and commander during the Northern expedition, He Long would soon find himself aligned with socialist elements of the party while serving under Zhang Fakui. The defeat of the KMT during the Northern Expedition has not sated his desire for change in China, and though he has fled back home to Hunan, he still commands the respect of his soldiers. His skills as a revolutionary are not to be underestimated, and he will be a useful asset to any army."

After graduating he returned to Hunan and commanded the Second Division of the Hunan Army in 1913. It was at this time that he met and become a close confidant of Zhao Hengti. In 1923 Zhao gave Ye command over Hunan’s Third Division\n\nWhen the Northern Expedition came to Hunan it was Ye Kaixin who immediately brought his army against Tang Shengzhi, but was forced out of Hunan and fled with Zhao to Wu Peifu and the Zhili. Wu made Ye the Commander-in-Chief of the Hunan Army, and when the Northern Expedition turned to favour the Zhili, it was Ye’s forces that recaptured Changsha, bringing it under Zhili control officially, but it was an open secret that Ye wanted to bring Zhao back into power in Hunan.\n\nLuckily for the General, Wu Peifu decided to appoint Zhao as the Governor of Hunan, and civilian control over the province soon came back as the KMT’s forces were driven out. While not the biggest fan of Sun Chuanfang, he accepted Hunan’s entrance into the League of Eight Provinces, although he prefers to keep his army on the eastern border, not trusting Sun to accept Hunan’s autonomy, or put down the insurgency in the Min-Gan zone.\n\nFor nearly the last decade, Ye Kaixin has been satisfied with the Status Quo, loyal to Zhao and friendly with the Northern Zhili, he’s one of the main Generals Zhao can rely on without worry, and has enjoyed the support of the Governor of Hunan."
 hnn.115.t: "Ye Kaixin flees"
 hnn.115.d: "One of Zhao’s most loyal commanders, Ye Kaixin, has fled from Hunan, most likely due to the man’s bitter rivalry with Tang Shengzhi. The two met on opposite sides twice during the Northern Expedition. Believing Tang would have wished to settle the score for Ye’s capture of Changsha back from him, the General fled from Changsha and Hunan."
 hnn.115.a: "We have no need for deserters anyway!"
 hnn.116.t: "Ye Kaixin arrives in Beijing"
 hnn.116.d: "Ye Kaixin has fled Hunan after Zhao Hengti's loss of power there. Fearing retribution from Tang Shengzhi for actions during the Northern Expedition, he has renewed his strenuous Zhili ties and arrived in Beijing to seek our protection. "
