 POLITICS_ULRIKE_MEINHOF_DESC:0 "A red state rises over the ashes of an old. Ulrike Meinhof, once a student organizer and one of Speer's most ardent and dedicated supporters has turned against her former ideals and destroyed everything that the student militias have fought so hard to build.\n\nShe preaches fire and fury. Who is Speer? The man has never been an ardent supporter of the cause. This became more clear by the day. Is he a Sicherheitsdeinst agent, simply here to ensure the rebels never reach their peak? He certainly never prosecuted the war as strongly as he could, despite accusations of child soldiers and a thousand other claims.\n\nWhat is his cause? What is liberalism in a Reich? What is liberalism when it's being led by a man a single shade of black away from Nazism? What use is liberalism when it goes against a power so evil as the slave empire of Germany? How does grey fight black? To truly do war, you must fire from as far away as possible. You can never copy your enemies ideals.\n\nCommunism, Socialism, Bolshevikism. Whatever the Nazis called it, many Germans grew up in utter ignorance of what it truly meant. Meinhof was different however, and she knew one thing was most important of all, whatever it was, it was as far divorced from Nazism as one could imagine.\n\nTo truly defeat evil, one must become what evil fears. Meinhof sees herself not only as a liberator of the people and the one who will break the chains the Reich has foisted upon them, but as the monster hiding under the Nazis bed."
