These men are the ones who have sided with the Burgundian System.\n\nThese men, once few in number, are now stronger than they've ever been. Heydrich's victory in Germany has granted the loyalists of the SS great weaponry and positions, which they now take up to defend against degenerate hordes that wish to tear down everything that the Aryan man has fought for. Many fight for the Burgundian System and Aryanism. Some fight for Himmler. Very few fight for - or know of - Himmler's true plans. Yet, no matter their reasons, they are armed, trained, deadly, and highly dangerous, and they will stop at nothing to put Europe under the cold scorch of the Black Sun."

Such a fight has been decried as useless and suicidal by many, yet their time is over.

Once, this territory and its people fought relentlessly to keep Japan from conquering them and their countrymen. Then, as the Japanese closed in on Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek, proud heroes of the resistance in Chongqing, they had no choice but to abandon the United Front and save themselves. Two decades of suffering later, a new Front has been born and the Chinese people have reforged their bonds once more. Though some may decry the mission of overthrowing Japanese control as suicidal and a journey of suffering, there are no regrets to be found. It is better to say one resisted for a day and was cut down, unlike the dogs in Nanjing who serve Japan China on a silver platter.

The diplomatic pride and joy of the Empire, the Triumvirate is- on paper- merely a defensive pact around the Mediterranean for mutual protection against the German Reich to their north. In practice, however, it was a masterstroke for Italian foreign policy. Italy's central place in the Mediterranean, and the bounty from her overseas Empire has granted her the unofficial position of first among equals amidst the Triumvirate's Founders.\n\nThe alliance has been on the decline, and as Italy seems to be its primary beneficiary, she is also the nation that has been fighting the hardest to keep it intact. Their Iberian and Turkish allies have not seen the diplomatic fruits of the partnership though, and without drastic action, this Italian bloc in all but name may indeed be reduced to merely Italy and her puppets."

What was a project in power projection for Italy and a way to shore up border concerns for Turkey was a matter of survival for Iberia, and as such Iberia fought for the formation and maintenance of the Triumvirate since its inception.\n\nBut times are different now. The Germans seem to be retracting inwards these days, or at least stagnating somewhat, and Iberia no longer feels the existential threat of the Reich loom over them so heavily anymore. Now it is the time to ask what Iberia's ambitions are, and whether or not the Triumvirate is conducive to those aims.

The Twentieth Century has seen great gains for the young republic, but with their massive successes, they have also gained much in the way of burdens, namely in the area of regional minorities that struggle ceaselessly against the nation. Turkey has needed breathing room to deal with these threats, and if nothing else the Triumvirate has provided exactly that.\n\nBut times change, and to survive, nations need to adapt to those changes. The Triumvirate is, to put it bluntly, a dying alliance. It no longer offers the security or support to Turkey that it once did, having evolved into a vanity project of Italian duces over the years.

This is all, of course, in exchange for the protection and security that the Triumvirate provides. Even still, many consider the inclusion within the Triumvirate to be more of a burden than an aid, because while they maintain their technical sovereignty over their own borders, everyone knows that Rome, Istanbul, and Madrid hold significant sway over the politicians in every one of the minor nations that seek out the Triumvirate."

The legal status of client states within the Triumvirate is murky, with the Founders desiring recognition for the full membership of their vassals, while also seeking to prevent the other two from doing the same.\n\nFor this reason, the status of clients and subordinate nations and regions will remain something of a grey area from now until the end of the alliance, which may be fast approaching. In spite of how little they truly gain from the alliance, the Triumvirate has thus far kept their master nations restrained and at peace with one another, but with the disintegration of the Triumvirate looking as likely as it is now, the smallest of nations have much to fear as the local juggernauts begin sharpening their knives..."

LEV_UNION_Member_desc:0 "This nation is a member of the Levantine Union, a mutual alliance, a powerful economic bloc, and a foreign alignment at the same time. Born after the Jerusalem Conference, this nation is young but promising. If the Union survives, perhaps it could be the first of a new breed of cooperation between nations..."
LEV_UNION_Mandate:0 "Levantine Union Mandate"
LEV_UNION_Mandate_desc:0 "This 'nation' is a Mandate of the Levantine Union, the mutual alliance, economic bloc, and alignment born after the Jerusalem Conference. Jerusalem is, in theory, a completely neutral zone, free from the sectarian conflicts that divide the rest of the Levant. As tensions rise, though, it remains to be seen if the Union's mandate system will remain in place..."


### Philippines
UFF_Faction: "Co-Founder of the United Filipino Front"
UFF_Faction_desc: "Malayang magkaisa; aliping mag-iisa. United we stand; divided we fall.\n\nThese are the tenets that the United Filipino Front abide to. This alliance of convenience is in truth, more than that. The §RAFRSR§! and the §DUSFIP§!, though heavily contrasted in ideals, share a common goal: to preserve the independence and freedom of the Philippines from any invaders willing to take it from them. Perhaps, this alliance may just be the key to their freedom, though perhaps it may not be enough as the rays of the rising sun loom above..."

### West Africa
# War
PALF_Faction: "Member of the Pan-African Liberation Front"
PALF_Faction_desc: "Division Attack: §G+15%§!\nDivision Recovery Rate: §G+5%§!\n\nBorn in the fires of German terror bombings and the revolutionary halls of Yaoundé, the Pan-African Liberation Front has dedicated itself to the liberation of Africa from the colonialist devils that wrack it. Based primarily in Cameroon, the organization crosses borders and cultures, striving for one goal- freedom and unity for all Africans.\n\nPan-Africanism is not without its opponents, of course. The Germans and English occupy everything south of the Sahara, the Italians control much of what's left, and the rest is snapped up by Iberians and French alike, leaving only slivers free. Still, the PALF fights on, waiting for its opportunity- an opportunity which will surely come, for nothing can hold the African people down forever."
PALF_Satellite: "Liberated Satellite"
PALF_Satellite_desc: "Division Defense: §G+10%§!\nDivision Recovery Rate: §R-5%§!\n\nThis nation is a Liberated Satellite, and has been freed by the Pan-African Liberation Front from the forces of colonialism and reaction. Its newly formed administration has chosen to cooperate with and be supervised by the Front in order to dismantle the remnants and legacies of imperialism. This nation and its leadership now follow the principles of Pan-Africanism, and work towards creating a united Africa, even if they are still nominally independent from their allies at this time. United by a common ideology, these Liberated Satellites shall work alongside the Front in order to create a new future for Africa."

WAA_Faction: "Signatory of the West African Alliance"
WAA_Faction_desc: "Division Defense on Core Territory: §G+15%§!\nReinforce Rate: §G+10%§!\n\nEstablished in light of Pan-African movements raising red flags across West Africa, both metaphorically and literally, Wolofia -among other nations- took it upon themselves to found a national defense pact, one which would ensure mutual safety from powers looking to destabilize neutral nations in the region. Of course, this alliance is one that exists out of necessity, as opposed to being a collection of nations within one sphere or another. In such circumstances as this, the WAA has no choice but to band together, lest it faces total collapse."
WAA_Protectorate: "West African Protectorate"
WAA_Protectorate_desc: "Entrenchment Speed: §G+10%§!\n\nThis nation is a West African Protectorate, and is under the supervision of one of the larger member nations within the West African Alliance. This protectorate status may have arisen out of willing collaboration, or through force of arms. No matter how this nation has ended up a protectorate of the Alliance, they depend on their allies both for military protection and internal stability. Without their allies within the Alliance to back them, the administration of this nation would be unlikely to survive for long. It is fortunate for them, then, that the West African Alliance is so willing to invest in their member nations."

FMA_Faction: "Signatory of the French Military Alliance"
FMA_Faction_desc: "Division Organization: §G+15%§!\nReinforce Rate: §G+10%§!\n\nThe last two decades have knocked the French giant flat on her back, but roots run deep in her former colonies. The French Military Alliance is, predictably, an alliance dominated by the Free French. Made up of nations in the French sphere of influence, whether out of goodwill or necessity, the FMA has drawn its line in the jungles of West Africa- here is where the radical Pan-Africans will be stopped, and here is where French influence will be restored.\n\nThe long term goal of the alliance is far more ambitious than power plays in the bombed-out ruins of West Africa- rather, the stated purpose of the FMA is the eventual reclamation of the homeland, 4,000 kilometers away. Though whether it'll ever achieve such a lofty goal is questionable, the current focus is clearly on affairs closer to home. Free France will reassert itself on the African stage, or it will die- and after all that's been sacrificed, the second is not an option."
FMA_Puppet: "French Military Puppet"
FMA_Puppet_desc: "Division Organization: §G+5%§!\nDivision Defense: §R-5%§!\nGDP to Overlord Modifier: §Y5%§!\n\nA familiar flag waves over cities across West Africa- that of the French Tricolor, pulled from dusty boxes where they were stored twenty years ago to proudly fly again. However, not all of these flags fly over French cities outright. Instead, these flags signify the coming of a new kind of state to the region- that of the puppet government.\n\nComparable to the colonies of before, these states are tied to France in every way but name. Though their governments are led by native Africans, it's impossible to miss the French soldiers keeping order in the streets, nor is it possible to not notice how closely every decision lines up with the Free French's preferred line. Quickly, these citizens have picked up on the new, inescapable truth- they are nothing more than a stepping stone in de Gaulle's dream of reclaiming Metropolitan France."

# Post War
PALF_Faction_peace: "Member of the Pan-African Liberation Front"
PALF_Faction_peace_desc: "GDP Growth Boost: §Y5%§!\n\nBorn in the fires of German terror bombings and the revolutionary halls of Yaoundé, the Pan-African Liberation Front has dedicated itself to the liberation of Africa from the colonialist devils that wrack it. Based primarily in Cameroon, the organization crosses borders and cultures, striving for one goal- freedom and unity for all Africans.\n\nPan-Africanism is not without its opponents, of course. The Germans and English occupy everything south of the Sahara, the Italians control much of what's left, and the rest is snapped up by Iberians and French alike, leaving only slivers free. Still, the PALF fights on, waiting for its opportunity- an opportunity which will surely come, for nothing can hold the African people down forever."
PALF_Satellite_peace: "Liberated Satellite"
PALF_Satellite_peace_desc: "GDP Growth Boost: §Y2%§!\nGDP to Overlord Modifier: §Y7.5%§!\n\nThis nation is a Liberated Satellite, and has been freed by the Pan-African Liberation Front from the forces of colonialism and reaction. Its newly formed administration has chosen to cooperate with and be supervised by the Front in order to dismantle the remnants and legacies of imperialism. This nation and its leadership now follow the principles of Pan-Africanism, and work towards creating a united Africa, even if they are still nominally independent from their allies at this time. United by a common ideology, these Liberated Satellites shall work alongside the Front in order to create a new future for Africa."

WAF_Faction: "Member of the West African Federation"
WAF_Faction_desc: "GDP Growth Boost: §Y5%§!\n\nAs the last ounce of blood has been shed on behalf of independence by the West African Alliance, the WAA has found itself without further threats against its existence, and it seemed its dissolution was inevitable. However, with the benefits of the alliance revealed with the end of the West African Conflict, it has become clear that further cooperation is only beneficial. With little incentive to break the alliance apart, relations between the nations have only improved, and drastically at that."
WAF_Supervised: "West African Supervised State"
WAF_Supervised_desc: "GDP Growth Boost: §Y2.5%§!\n\nThis nation is a West African Supervised State, and is under the common supervision from the member states of the West African Federation. This supervision is required to guarantee stability within the nation's territory, and to prop up its administration as it recovers. Born from the ashes of recent conflict and war, these supervised states are still unstable and in need of outside assistance in order to stay afloat. While these nations are not nominally members of the West African Federation, they are completely tied to it, and are expected to be fully pushed into the Federation in the future."

FRU_Faction: "French Community Member"
FRU_Faction_desc: "GDP Growth Boost: §Y5%§!\n\nLiberty. Fraternity. Equality.\n\nThese are the core of the enshrined values that compose the new French Community, one of the newest international entities on the world stage. The question remains if the French Community truly embodies these values - or if it is merely a rebranding of the former French Empire.\n\nOfficially, the ultimate intent of the Community is to economy and militarily link its member states for mutual prosperity. In practice, this primarily serves to secure and elevate French interests - which will one day include the return to the homeland, and reclamation of the Metropolis."
FRU_Associated: "French Associated State"
FRU_Associated_desc: "GDP Growth Boost: §Y1.5%§!\nGDP to Overlord Modifier: §Y12.5%§!\n\nThe Associated States of the French Community are nations who officially receive protection and economic support from the Community. But nothing comes for free.\n\nIt is more than protection they receive, but direct supervision by the French. There are still limits, as the control exercised by the French varies, with many retaining a notable degree of autonomy.\n\nNonetheless, French influence is pervasive - and they exercise deep control over the nation's economy. The end expectation is simple - the French expect that it is not a matter of if these nations will join the French Community in full - but when."

Mano_Member: "Signatory of the Mano River Pact"
Mano_Member_desc: "The overwhelming victory of Pan-Africanism over its chosen enemies has not been welcomed in the slightest by certain peoples and nations of West Africa. Sierra Leone and Liberia remain as the sole roadblocks upon which the PALF might still trip and fall - so long as they can keep their guns pointed east, rather than at each other across the river for which their alliance is named."

UAS_Member: "Member of the United Arab States"
UAS_Member_desc: "The United Arab States is born in the ashes of the faltering Italian, as a host of nations proclaim their sovereignty and unite in the struggle to cast off the chains of colonialism, and take hold over their own destiny. These newly christened revolutionary states are committed to the unification of the Arab world in its entirety, from the Atlas Mountains to the dunes of the Arabian Peninsula, into a single whole assailing the forces of imperialism and protecting against what they may perceive as threats to the continued survival of their Pan-Arab experiment."

# Indonesian Civil War
INS_leader: "Central Government Leader"
INS_leader_desc: "The promises of the Garuda seemed broken at the outset of the war. Sukarno, founder and a hero of independence, faces down an unprecedented rebellion that had rent the Unitary Republic of Indonesia in twain. Sukarno is no stranger to dissent; he had faced separatist revolts within the nation before, and purged those who did not agree with his idea of unity in archipelago. "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika," the Garuda promised, its talons holding aloft the scroll that proclaimed the Sanskrit motto of "Unity in Diversity." Sukarno and his followers prepare themselves for a long war to uphold this ideal once more and again into eternity."

INS_loyalist: "Central Government Loyalist"
INS_loyalist_desc: "Comprised of emergency governments and loyal regional commands, the NKRI itself is split into four factions, one in each Sukarnoite strongholds in Djakarta, Soerabaja, Makassar, and Palembang. Each has differing interests to explain their alignment. Nonetheless, they present a united front against the rebel forces led by Hatta, and every hard-won victory would advance the loyalist cause that much more."

PRIM_leader: "PRIM Leader"
PRIM_leader_desc: "The promises of the Garuda seemed broken before the outset of the war. The ideal of unity and plurality, the overarching themes towards which every Indonesian nationalist should strive, were broken at every turn by the central government. Moehammad Hatta once counted himself among the most loyal of Soekarno's inner circle. Now, his disillusionment channeled the breakages the nation had suffered in the thirty years since the nation's independence, becoming a rebellion that spread like wildfire. The split ideals now hold themselves in martial contest and a brother spills a brother's blood."

PRIM_loyalist: "PRIM Loyalist"
PRIM_loyalist_desc: "Eclectic and mismatched, the forces of the Free Government of Indonesia nonetheless bring its strength to bear in the field. A theme unites them: a disdain against the central government that had festered since Soekarno decided to continue on the centralizing course first decided by the Sidik government. Comprising of military councils led by colonels in various parts of the country, Islamists in South Sulawesi, separatists in Atjeh, and communist militias in Madiun and Soerakarta, they face a united front presented by the NKRI government."
