Ostland's Wehrmacht would preside over the territories and crush any remaining partisans.

Judging from Drechsler's quaking knees and sweaty brow, it was an intimidation tactic and it was working. They did not call him Bloody Ferdinand for nothing. \"Damn it, Gewecke. We never should have asked in the first place. If it wasn't for you drafting out the demands-\"\n\n\"Me, drafting out the demands?\" Gewecke asked, incredulously. \"You were practically drooling for those new territories.\"\n\nDrechsler shook his head, refusing to continue the conversation.

Let us not push our luck too much but keep me in the know if anything new springs up.\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" Gewecke responded.

 DST.19.d:0 "\"Reichskommissar!\" Lukas cried as he burst into the room. \"The Führer himself is on the line! I'll put him through to you immediately.\"\n\n\"What?\" Drechsler looked up from his paperwork with wide eyes. Hermann Göring was phoning him? The Führer himself was phoning Drechsler? \"Yes, yes, put him through.\" He plucked up the phone and waited eagerly for the click.\n\n\"Reichskommissar Drechsler!\" came the tired but cheerful voice. \"A pleasure to speak with you. I have some fantastic proposals for Ostland's garrison.\"\n\nAs the call continued, Drechsler's grin slowly faded away. Göring spoke with great enthusiasm as he described enforcing military modernizations of the garrison, modernizations that sounded both costly and tiresome. His weak attempts at rebuttals were swiftly waved away by the charismatic Führer. Drechsler's grip on the phone was tightening in anger. This is why he had called?"

 DST.20.d:0 "As the horrors of the Ostland Civil War exploded with the region's continued collapse, betrayal was widespread. The non-German divisions of the Waffen-SS turned tail and fled to the slimy Vituska, who embraced their strength and resources with open arms. The question remains how best to deal with these untermenschen traitors. There is no questioning their value as skilful and experienced soldiers, but can we risk treason against the Reich breaking out among their ranks yet again?"

 DST.21.d:0 "In his wisdom, Reichskommissar Drechsler has seen fit to pardon the Waffen-SS who served under Vituska and allow them back into our ranks. These men are many things - ruthless, hardened, skilled. One thing they are not, however, is stupid. These Untermensch know that their lives are at stake and are more than willing to continue serving us. Afterall, they know what will befall them if they dare turn against us yet again."
