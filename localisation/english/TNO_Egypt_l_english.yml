 POLITICS_FAROUK_I_DESC:0 "이집트의 왕 파루크에 대해선 여러 관점이 있습니다. 긍정적으로 보자면 파루크는 삶을 파티로 만들기로 결심했습니다. 매순간이 늙거나 둔해지지 않기 위한 노력에서 즐겁고 신나는 순간이어야 합니다. 부정적으로 보자면 그는 이집트 경제의 싱크홀인데 아무런 정치적 책임도 없고 이집트에게 난감한 존재입니다. 왕은 한때 나라를 개혁하고 현대화하는데 열정적인 젊은이였습니다. 하지만 그 시절은 지나갔고, 이제 파루크는 자신을 즐겁게 할 방법만 연구합니다.\n\n파루크는 할 일이 없으면 먹고 마시고 담배를 피우며 시간을 보냅니다. 빨간 스포츠카를 타고 카이로거리를 전속력으로 달리거나 군중들에게 금화를 뿌리는 자선활동을 하는 막나가는 순간은 불행히도 자주 일어납니다. 만약 왕이 특별히 활동적인 기분을 느끼면, 그는 제트기를 타고 원하는 목적지로 날아갑니다. 그의 부재는 1, 2주간 더 유능한 책임자를 남기기 때문에 즐거운 일입니다.\n\n파루크는 세계여행을 하면서 이집트 국고를 \"훌륭한\" 용도로 사용합니다. 애첩을 위한 다이아몬드 목걸이든, 계속 확장되는 동전 수집이든, 불멸을 위한 한 방이든, 그의 욕망을 위해 아낌없이 사용합니다. 그가 구매하는 모든 것은 이집트 사람들에게 전혀 도움이 되지 않습니다. 파루크는 나쁜 의도도 없고 악하지도 않지만, 바로 옆 세상에는 별 관심이 없습니다. 정치는 왕에게 딱딱하고 지겨우며 지루한 일이고, 그래서 그는 그것을 무시합니다. 그는 세상이 그에게 바라는 것보다는 스스로의 행복에만 관심이 있습니다."

As his adventures have been hitting front page newspapers across the globe, the question of how exactly he finances this has come into question. It appears that the Swiss have figured out that he is siphoning from the government's wealth and using astute calculations have figured out that he will be running out soon enough.\n\nTherefore, they have approached Farouk with the offer of giving him extraordinarily large loans with a high interest rate to keep him going on his adventures across the globe, which Farouk has indicated he has intended to do. Leading economists of our government have strongly advised against this saying that it would crumble the already weak Egyptian economy, however Farouk has yet to reply to the government."

Some even reported that the last surviving leader of the Free Officers movement, Gamel Abdel Nasser was seen at these meetings!\n\nWhile the government dismisses these stories as sensationalist nonsense, many in the government are worried about the Ba'athists organising and launching a revolution against our regime."

He also called for people to find their way back to the true light of Islam and not to remain the Takfirs that they have been led to become.\n\nBefore he could finish his speech, Egyptian policemen came into the square to break up the rally, much to the crowds anger."

To the anguish of the Iberian welcoming party, the transportation prepared for Farouk proved to be inadequate to transport his numerous escorts and luggage in addition to himself.\n\nBut such logistical problems could not interest the king the tiniest bit. Here he was, in Iberia, a land that promised to provide a multitude of pleasures to indulge in!"

Anything a man desires can be bought in these holes-in-walls, and vast amounts of money change hands daily. An especially infamous part of these markets are formed by historical artifacts, from antiquities around the world to memorabilia from the Second World War. Farouk's interest in all things expensive lead him to a certain shopkeeper, and soon he found himself in an auction for something dangerous.\n\nOnce the shopkeeper had determined that Farouk was indeed a man of great wealth, he invited the king to a secret auction happening in a shady warehouse. With the promise of items for sale that he would not want to miss, Farouk and his guards accepted the invitation. Upon arrival, Farouk joined a motley crew of a dozen others, among which two individuals stood out. The two large and imposing men, boasting a few scars on their faces, remained silent through most of the auction, as rare and expensive paintings, books and pottery was sold to the rest of the crowd. Farouk himself bought a few chandeliers, but the item advertised to him was the final piece on offer; A vial containing water from the Fountain of Youth."
 egy.10.a:0 "Intriguing..."
 egy.12.t:0 "The Auction of a Lifetime"
 egy.12.d:0 "The auctioneer explained that the vial allegedly containing water from a fountain of legends had been passed on for centuries to great men and women throughout history. Beginning from Alexander the Great, it was said to have graced the hands of such men as Charlemagne, Elizabeth I and Otto von Bismarck, and in the aftermath of the Great War, it had been lost, only to end up in this warehouse for sale today. While suspicious, Farouk could not afford to miss on this chance of a lifetime. It was now that the two odd men sprung into action.\n\nThe auction was intense, and the constant gasping of the audience was music to Farouk's ears as the price kept climbing. Soon, it was Farouk against the two men. In a final bid to secure victory, Farouk made an offer the two men simply could not match, and the day was won.\n\nWhile the price had been disgustingly high, Farouk received the vial. To the shock of everyone in the room, he drank the contents as soon as he got the vial in his hands. His two competitors lamented loudly in German, and prior to making their exit they remarked that the League would not forget such an insult. Farouk naturally didn't give another thought to the threat, after all, he was now immortal! Unless he had been lied to from the start, which his pride would not allow to even be a possibility."

A party in your name, with the most extravagant and lavish event with the richest and most famous people of the world attending. He might be very inebriated and at least a little high, but he could still think clearly enough to feel proud. He had travelled the world, seen the sights, met the good and the great, and had a hell of a good time doing it. These past 2 years, in Farouks eyes at least, were the best of the world.\n\nHowever, as he moved away from the buffet after gorging himself on food, he felt odd. It felt like something was stuck, and he had a hard time pinning down what was wrong. When he tried to speak, he quickly realised the issue. Something was stuck in his throat. He started trying to speak, trying to cough, anything to get people attention, trying to get the words out for help. Won't anyone notice, anyone come to help him? However, people were too busy talking amongst themselves, with the music drowning out his attempts at choking out a call for assistance. He collapsed to the ground, in his drunken state being unable to control his movements. His vision grew darker, the noises around him disappearing into the background. He made one last attempt at crying for help, trying to sputter out a final noise to try and get someone to come to his aid.\n\nBut nobody came.\n\nHis last thoughts were of his son, and how sorry he felt for him."
