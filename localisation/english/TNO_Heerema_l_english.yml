 POLITICS_PIETER_SCHELTE_HEEREMA_HEE_DESC:0 "Every decent family knows that you keep an extra bottle of your wine for when the situation absolutely demands it. For the German authority in Ukraine, Pieter Schelte Heerema is that extra bottle.\n\nA Dutchman from Amsterdam, Heerema was quick to collaborate with the Germans, joining the Waffen-SS in 1940. During his tenure, he helped establish and lead the Nederlandsche Oost Compagnie, which organized the Dutch settlement of the Reich's eastern territories during the war. It is through this channel that Heerema found himself in RK Ukraine by the war's end, helping in the administrative efforts of the colony.\n\nAfter the failure of the West Russian War, and the attempted SS coup in Germania, Heerema began to distance himself more and more from Himmler and the organization, while still officially retaining his SS title. Through his colonial and SS connections, he was able to ascend the ladder of the RK, all while managing to profit off of the 'rightful Germanization of the land'.\n\nAs the Reichskommissariat of Ukraine collapsed, Heerema took this opportunity to show his true colors. Instead of continuing as a Reichskommissar would, he has lead a revolt with the NOC and established the Volksdirektorat der Ukraine, opposed to the Reichskommissariat. With this newfound power, perhaps he could focus exclusively on what he wants...\n\nThe sweet smell of profit."
