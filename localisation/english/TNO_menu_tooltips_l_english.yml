TNO_ugly_american_icon_tt_delayed: "§F§m"The Ugly American"§! is a §DCold War§! political novel published in §Y1958§! commenting on §MAmerica§!'s foreign policy. Inspired by the authors' experiences in Southeast Asia, the book depicts the hapless efforts of America's elite diplomatic corps in their attempt to thwart a communist insurgency in the fictional nation of Sarkhan. Through a series of vignettes, each focused on a different character, it describes how several self-obsessed "princes of bureaucracy" undermine a project to raise local nutrition, thwart a band of anti-communist fighters, orchestrate the dismissal of competent staff, and fail to convince Washington of a coup. While the Soviets seek to understand the local culture, the Americans are aloof, brash, and fail to even learn the local language.\n\n"The Ugly American" of the title takes its name from the hero Homer Atkins, a multimillionaire engineer whose willingness to work hard with locals has left him with calloused, ugly, grease-stained hands. Through his and others' stories, the book urges American diplomats to treat foreign people with respect and decency, to make efforts to understand their hosts and why they might be swayed by "anti-American" and anti-capitalist rhetoric. It also calls Americans to look for small, on-the-ground aid projects that can make a real difference instead of flashy and expensive projects that serve primarily to glorify America and its representatives.\n\nThe book was adapted into a 1963 movie starring Marlon Brando. Its epilogue calling for a "a small force of well-trained, well-chosen, hard-working and dedicated professionals" fluent in the local language helped inspire John F. Kennedy's Peace Corps. It remains a popular book for Americans abroad.§!"
