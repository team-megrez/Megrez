 SL_customname_guangzhou: "one of the Three Pearls"

 # Notes
 
 # [GetSLName] is a scripted loc used to get custom names, for example, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macaw's name is called "The Three Pearls" instead of the usual state name it's parented in, located in TNO_state_lore_misc_scripted_localisation.txt
 
 # INITIALS are preferably airport codes: for example LAX as Los Angeles, but not when it doesn't make sense, i.e. OPO as Porto. I chose to use POR in that case.

 state_lore_initials.1: "GER"
 state_lore_name.1: "Germania"
 state_lore_desc.1: "Welthauptstadt-Germania may look like the shining fruit of the Führer's labor, but its roots run deep, as does the rot infecting it.\n\nHundreds of meters below Speer's elegantly designed promenades and Hitler's megalomaniacal symbols of his will, great concrete and steel superstructures groan under the weight of the Welthauptstadt, while pumps run round the clock to keep the swamps of Old Berlin from swallowing the Führer's vision.\n\nThe tremendous, and classified, cost of reshaping Berlin far exceeded even the plunder of a dozen nations, and outside the whispering grand halls of the city centre, the Berliners of old still live like before Germania's rise, or in cheap apartment blocks for the unemployed masses."

 state_lore_initials.2: "TYO"
 state_lore_name.2: "Tōkyō"
 state_lore_desc.2: "Beneath the facade of the mighty "eastern capital" of the Empire of Japan, behind the curtains of the Imperial Palace and its bustling wards, and under the blanket of the city's lively aura lies great sorrow and corruption.\n\nIn military headquarters, IJA Generals and IJN Admirals constantly try their earnest to foil the plans of the other as they scheme their own, and those willing to cooperate plan the next operation to put down freedom fighters somewhere in the Sphere.\n\nIn the halls of the national diet, politicians bicker of their own 'correct' way of running the nation and the Empire, seemingly without end. Not to mention the corruption that runs deep within the veins of every politician, the one that replaces their will to shape a better future for Japan with their want of money.\n\nPerhaps, it is best to keep these facts out of mind and enjoy the great sights of this bastion of Japanese glory."

 state_lore_initials.3: "YOK"
 state_lore_name.3: "Yokohama"
 state_lore_desc.3: "There exists few twin cities around the world, most cities differ in one way or another with their neighboring cities, but such is not the case with Yokohama and Tōkyō.\n\nAt face value, these two cities can be seen as carbon copies of each other. Tōkyō and Yokohama are the largest and second largest cities respectively in terms of population size, they are both economically vital to the Japanese Empire, and they are both large port cities with hundreds of ships dropping anchor there each day.\n\nThe city's prominence as a port city can be traced back from near the end of the Edo period, and it is where Commodore Perry first landed and forced in the modern age.\n\nToday, along with civilian ships, Yokohama is a major naval base for IJN fleets, enforcing the will of the Empire around the home islands as well as a base of operations for naval movements across the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the Pacific Ocean."

 state_lore_initials.4: "LAX"
 state_lore_name.4: "Los Angeles"
 state_lore_desc.4: "The largest city on the west coast. The third largest city in the country. The home of America's, and arguably the world's, entertainment industry.\n\nThe story of Los Angeles is full of controversy, but no one can say it isn't interesting. Originally a small coastal town, LA began to grow rapidly towards the end of the nineteenth century, continuing unabated through World War 2 and even the 1950s following the Japanese seizure of the port.\n\nAs the home of Hollywood, LA has earned a reputation as a land of glitz and glamor, though the diverse and often impoverished neighborhoods of the growing city are on the front lines of America's civil rights movement."

 state_lore_name.5_JAP: "Rafuko (Port of Los Angeles)"
 state_lore_desc.5: "At the height of World War 2, the port of Los Angeles employed almost 100,000 Americans. These days only a small fraction of that number turn up for work every day, and a different flag flies over the warships that fill the harbor.\n\nAs one of the two Japanese concessions bordering the American mainland, the port of LA is a constant hotspot of world tension. Japanese and US soldiers watch each other from behind checkpoints, and both the sailors of the IJN and the residents of LA hope their uncomfortable proximity never escalates to hostility.\n\nWhile some demand the United States take action and reclaim it, their pleas fall deaf, §Rfor now.§! §YPerhaps one day, a President bold enough may take back the ports, or possibly even more.§!"

 state_lore_initials.6: "SFO"
 state_lore_name.6: "San Francisco"
 state_lore_desc.6: "Following the gold rush of 1848 San Francisco became the largest city on the west coast of North America. Though it has since been surpassed in size by the likes of Los Angeles and San Diego, it retains its importance as a center of American finance and cultural development.\n\nThe rolling hills and rail-lined streets of San Francisco have long been a home to America's more eccentric elements and the budding counterculture, most recently manifesting as the beat movement of the 1950s, though many suspect this is only a hint of what is soon to come for the city by the bay."

 state_lore_name.7_JAP: "Kuwako (Port of San Francisco)"
 state_lore_desc.7: "Much like its European namesake, the Paris of the West is a city divided. Though most of the city remains in the USA, the port facilities have been held by Japan since 1945. One of the farthest flung territories of the Japanese Empire, the port of San Francisco is a major asset to the sphere.\n\nThe tiny sliver of Japanese territory, along with its southern counterpart in Los Angeles, are constant sources of tension between two of the world's superpowers, but as long as the Japanese retain their ability to immediately threaten the entire west coast, they're happy to pay that price.\n\nWhile some demand the United States take action and reclaim it, their pleas fall deaf, §Rfor now.§! §YPerhaps one day, a President bold enough may take back the ports, or possibly even more.§!"

 state_lore_initials.8: "NYC"
 state_lore_name.8: "New York City"
 state_lore_desc.8: "The very definition of a city that never sleeps, New York City is the fruit of the labor of generations of hardworking individuals, with an astounding amount of commerce passing through it each and every day.\n\nFirst settled by the Dutch in 1624 as New Amsterdam, it changed hands over the centuries and now stands as a proud bastion of American freedoms, exemplified by the Statue of Liberty in its harbor. Countless different cultures have taken root in the city, long a relative safe haven for oppressed peoples from all over the world from tyranny in their distant homelands.\n\nEqually attractive as the open mindedness of the city, however, are its open markets, being one of the premier centers of international business and finance as well as the greatest display of American economic might. There's always something to do in New York for any person willing to pay the right price."

 state_lore_initials.9: "D.C."
 state_lore_name.9: "Washington D.C."
 state_lore_desc.9: "To describe Washington, D.C. as just a city would be entirely inappropriate. D.C. is more than a collection of buildings or roads, it is more than the amalgamation of human will, forced together into an urban sprawl that defines D.C.\n\nNo, what defines the District of Columbia best is the building on the hill- the home of freedom and security, in a world where such a commodity is hard to come by. Such freedom is not fought over for the denizens of this city, but fought with, in the halls of Congress, where issues of undeniable importance are fought over and where the future of the nation as a whole is decided.\n\nWith the stirring winds of democracy blowing strong, and the future uncertain as ever, these freedoms of democracy are more than something to ensure freedom, but something to hold on to in these turbulent times. May they protect us forevermore."

 state_lore_initials.10: "ROM"
 state_lore_name.10: "Rome"
 state_lore_desc.10: "Rome, the Eternal City, stands as the jewel of the Mediterranean and the capital of the Italian Empire. Founded millennia ago by Romulus on the banks of the Tiber, few cities- if any- can claim such an expansive history. Indeed, there's not an inch of the city that isn't rich with the legacy of the Roman Empire, the pride of Italian history.\n\nDespite the invasions, plagues, and misfortunes that have fallen on the city before, Rome has always emerged from the rubble, ready to rebuild- and, in doing so, has cemented its place as the center of Italy. It is here where the King, the Pope, and the Duce stay, and it is here that the Italian government sits, along with artists, culinary geniuses, and romantics from across the world.\n\nMake no mistake- Rome has survived thousands of years before, and- barring the apocalypse- it will survive thousands of years more."

 state_lore_initials.11: "MAD"
 state_lore_name.11: "Madrid"
 state_lore_desc.11: "Previously devastated by over two years under siege during the Spanish Civil War, Madrid has recovered to become the largest and wealthiest city in Iberia.\n\nThe unique and varied designs of Madrid's "Gran Vía" is admired by architects and artists the world over. Most of the country's brightest minds attend university here, nearly all Iberian films are produced here, and most of Iberia's largest companies are headquartered here.\n\nAs Iberians increasingly choose to leave the countryside for the city, tens of thousands move to Madrid every year, this rapid expansion has made Madrid into one of the single largest cities in Europe--and there are no signs that this growth is slowing down."

 state_lore_initials.12: "HAM"
 state_lore_name.12: "Hamburg"
 state_lore_desc.12: "At the mouth of the Elbe lies the Hanseatic City of Hamburg, the third largest city in Germany behind only Vienna and Germania itself. The birthplace of the Hanseatic league, since medieval times Hamburg has been the preeminent naval port connecting Germany to the rest of the world. In the post-war order, her stature only becomes more significant.\n\nBut little is stable in Hamburg. A hotbed of liberal agitation since the 19th century, Hamburg now finds itself torn between the reformists, the conservatives, and behind closed doors, even anti-fascist revolutionaries.\n\nBut for the subversives captured by the Gestapo, a horrible fate lies just a few miles upstream. There sits Neuengamme, the largest concentration camp in Germany proper, a symbol of Nazi tyranny in the eyes of nearly the entire world."

 state_lore_initials.13: "FRA"
 state_lore_name.13: "Frankfurt am Main"
 state_lore_desc.13: "Lying directly in the center of Central Europe's most densely populated and economically productive region, Frankfurt am Main is in many senses an enormous monument to German industry. Every year, thousands of the best minds and most talented workers in all the Reich make Frankfurt their home.\n\nBefore Hitler's rise to power, thousands of the best minds and most talented workers in all Europe would seek to make Frankfurt their home. Once the home of Germany's largest Jewish community, widely regarded as the birthplace of German liberalism, and recognized as a center of the European labor movement, Frankfurt has now stagnated for decades, as skill and ingenuity are abandoned for the convenience of slave labor.\n\nNevertheless, Frankfurt remains one of Germany's largest cities, and serves as the main railway junction between the Rhineland and the rest of the country."

 state_lore_initials.14: "MUC"
 state_lore_name.14: "München"
 state_lore_desc.14: "München, also known as Munich in English, has played a pivotal role in German history for centuries. It served as the capital of the Kingdom of Bavaria, hosting thinkers and creators from Max Planck to Richard Wagner. But it took on a far greater significance in the last half-century: the cradle of the Nazi Party.\n\nFollowing the German defeat in the First World War, München was a chaotic place, as two competing revolutionary socialist governments clashed with the Freikorps in the streets. It was in this environment where a small group of nationalist ideologues and disgruntled veterans coalesced to form the German Workers' Party.\n\nOne of its members, an Austrian-born veteran named Adolf Hitler, would climb the ranks and become its leader, transforming it into the National Socialist German Workers' Party. It was in the beer halls of München that Hitler built his first power base, and launched his failed putsch in 1923. It was where the Nazi Party established their national headquarters. And it was where Hitler convinced the British and French to cede him Czechoslovakia to secure a peace he had no intent of keeping. München remains a bastion of Nazism today, and he who is most influential in it has the key to the Nazi heartland."

 state_lore_initials.15: "BIO"
 state_lore_name.15: "Bilbao"
 state_lore_desc.15: "Sitting beside Iberia's most fertile estuary, atop a mountain of iron ore, Bilbao was always destined to become one of the great industrial cities of Iberia. But Bilbao is also the cultural capital of the Basque people, who have lived in Iberia for centuries and likely millennia, longer than the Latins.\n\nGradually stripped of their autonomy, and their traditional culture challenged by Spaniard encroachment, much of the city's youth views 'Iberian unity' as a polite euphemism for repression. Bilbao will no doubt be the site of many political battles in coming years."

 state_lore_initials.16: "BCN"
 state_lore_name.16: "Barcelona"
 state_lore_desc.16: "The head and heart of Catalonia was the first of Iberia's cities to fully industrialize, but recent decades have brought immense hardship to the people of Iberia's largest Mediterranean city.\n\nFor two and a half years during the Spanish Civil War, Barcelona was the capital of an abortive anarchist revolution. In a city further destabilized by repressive policies targeting the Catalan people, and further jeopardized by economic stagnation, the memory of that revolution lives on.\n\nBarcelona has suffered from steady economic decline in recent decades. Should the situation fail to improve, already widespread anti-government and separatist sentiments may become overwhelming."

 state_lore_initials.17: "POR"
 state_lore_name.17: "Porto"
 state_lore_desc.17: "Portugal's second largest city was the birthplace of the medieval Portuguese Kingdom, as well as the 1926 revolution which began Salazar's rise to power.\n\nThough the exceptionally fast growth of Lisbon has reduced the relative importance of Porto it remains the largest manufacturing hub in the whole country. The population of Porto is somewhat more conservative than the rest of Portugal, and support for Iberian Unity is much higher than in Lisbon."

 state_lore_initials.18: "LIS"
 state_lore_name.18: "Lisboa"
 state_lore_desc.18: "Once the Shining Jewel of all the World's Desire, Lisboa, forged by Ulysses has suffered much over the years. Yet, the 20th century has pumped fresh blood into the aging collosus. Thanks to the extermination of their Atlantic rivals by Hitler's craven ambition, Lisboa reemerged as the most paramount port city in Western Europe, serving as a beacon for commerce and migration to any Eastward Travellers from the Americas. With the entry to the Tejo guarded by Christ on one side and the New Colossus on the other, Lisboa is without question the city that bears the ripest fruit from the so-called "Iberian Project".\n\nDespite this untold prosperity, its citizens do not find themselves wholly supportive of the regime that governs them. Torn between the mays of Charybdis - Caetano's Reformist influence on the city from his position of Dean of the University of Lisbon - and the many heads of Scylla - Borges' Conservative compadres in the City Council - the ideals of Liberalism and Socialism call Lisboa home. From the dock workers to the university students, the city would become a beacon for Reformist thought, at least outside its government. Despite itself, Lisboa still stands tall as a bastion of concord in the barbarity that is Europe in the 20th century, even if some inside it would prefer for it not to be the case. However, as for what the future holds? Only Christ understands. And he is content to watch over the city in stony silence."

 state_lore_initials.19: "SVL"
 state_lore_name.19: "Sevilla"
 state_lore_desc.19: "The heart of the old Spanish empire, Sevilla was one of the largest, wealthiest, and most magnificent cities in early-modern Europe. With the construction of the Gibraltar Dam, vast quantities of goods traded between the Mediterranean and the Americas now must pass through Sevilla to be shipped abroad, increasing trade activity in the city to levels not seen since the heyday of the Spanish Empire.\n\nThough its population is not rising as rapidly as that of Lisbon, Sevilla has resumed its place as one of the most prosperous cities of Iberia. Concerning to some and inspirational to others, Sevilla is also Iberia's most prominent centers of underground liberal political organization in the country."

 state_lore_initials.21: "BES"
 state_lore_name.21: "Brest"
 state_lore_desc.21: "France has been a thalassocratic power for much of its history, owning most notably to its numerous overseas possessions, but also to its large coast bordering the Atlantic Ocean: Brest, standing at the westernmost point of the Breton peninsula, is one of France's proudest outposts, and sternly glares at the sea, its numerous lighthouses having lit the paths of many a lost sailor.\n\nHowever, whispers abound in Breizh, as the Quiberon peninsula has recently gone silent. Rumors of disgruntled nationalists finally deciding to act are growing louder and louder, and soon darkness may manage to do what the ocean never could: engulf Brest, and Brittany as a whole, once and for all."

 state_lore_initials.22: "PIS"
 state_lore_name.22: "Poitiers"
 state_lore_desc.22: "Gallic tribes founded Poitiers years before Caesar's arrival, and Poitiers has played host to French victories during the Battle of Tours and French defeats during the Hundred Years War.\n\nThe city has been a university town, a hotbed of religious conflict, and a garrison town all within several centuries. Nowadays, Poitiers finds itself in an interesting position, halfway between Paris and Bordeaux. The central-western town of France is once again a strategic location for the three divided powers seeking to rule their fraction of Western Europe."

 state_lore_initials.23: "BOD"
 state_lore_name.23: "Bordeaux"
 state_lore_desc.23: "The Moon's Harbor, as it is often called, is one of France's biggest and populous cities, and one that was left relatively unscathed by the multiple turmoils France had to endure. Renowned the world over for its tasteful wine, with its historical monuments being a source of pride, Bordeaux truly stands today as one of the country's most important cities.\n\nBordeaux being mostly spared from hardship came from no miracle, however. Mayor Adrien Marquet's enthusiastic collaboration, along with the founding of pro-PPF college Sciences Po Bordeaux in the late 40s, ensured that the city would be viewed as a bastion of the Révolution Nationale, free from the corrupting influences of reformism and bolshevism. How much more can the Harbor last, however, before the flood gates forcibly open?"

 state_lore_initials.24: "MRS"
 state_lore_name.24: "Marseille"
 state_lore_desc.24: "Founded in 600 BCE as one of the oldest cities in Europe, Marseille has stood tall from its ancient Greek origins to its contemporary French authority.\n\nDevastating civil wars, barbarians, sieges, plagues, revolutions, and world wars have all conspired to destroy the ancient city, and World War II nearly cast the city into the inescapable fire, but its people have survived and thrived throughout.\n\nThe city saw Rouget de Lisle write the French national anthem, La Marseillaise. The old city stands today as one of the largest cities in France; may God preserve Marseille for many more centuries."

 state_lore_initials.25: "PAR"
 state_lore_name.25: "Paris"
 state_lore_desc.25: "Ask a Parisian about Paris in 1901, and he might have described it to you as the center of his country. Ask a Parisian about Paris in 1919, and he might have told you of it as the center of the world. Ask a Parisian about Paris today, and you will get a canvas of broken dreams and lost glory, a twinge of sadness in his eyes, for the years have not been kind to the Ville-Lumière.\n\nOnce a capital of all things cultured, Paris today stands as a shadow of its former self. The Haussmannian buildings frown at the daily sight of German soldiers, as Parisians try their best to live their lives in spite of all the hardships they have to endure. And yet, they live on, for better or for worse; for there is no alternative but to give in to despair, as the denizens of France know all too well."

 state_lore_initials.26: "N-PR"

 state_lore_desc.26: "Ever since the SS's attempt at seizing the Reich and their banishment as far west from Germania as possible, the City of Light has remained half shrouded in darkness - divided both naturally by the Seine and unnaturally by the harsh stones and barbed wire of the Paris Wall.\n\nHimmler's regime has crushed with an iron heel all that Parisians held dear in the parts of the city it controls, replacing them with brutalist monuments to Germanic culture and endless sprawls of guard-towers and searchlights glaring into every building and home in the city.\n\nWith every passing moment, the damage becomes more and more comprehensive - with the birth of every child christened in German rather than French, it becomes more irreversible. If there is one place in Europe that embodies the endless nightmare of the New Order, it is Nord-Paris."

 state_lore_initials.27: "C-FR"

The citizens of this city look upon the des Puys mountains and can't help but feel safe at the sight of them- volcanic or not they are far less dangerous than the outside powers that threaten the national sovereignty of their nation.\n\nAs people from across France and Europe travel to Clermont-Ferrant to study in the universities, they witness both culture and history. From the baroque Cathedrals to romantic art across the city, onlookers witness that France still is a nation of beauty and tradition."

 state_lore_desc.28: "The prized capital of Switzerland rests on a plateau north of the Alps, where it represents one of the oldest surviving confederacies in the world. The city demonstrates an interesting blend of some French and mostly German culture, having been a previous territory of the Holy Roman Empire and Revolutionary France.\n\nToday, the Swiss capital rejoices in its isolated independence. The city hosted socialist Internationals during World War I and saw frequent mediation and espionage between the Allied and Axis powers during World War II. Despite the heavy German influence felt in Bern, Swiss forces are always fiercely committed to maintaining everlasting independence in this time of global turmoil."

And yet, the city is not without its low points being a territory of Spain, France, and currently under Nazi German influence.\n\nDespite this, Amsterdam is slowly making a return to its glory days and reinforcing itself as a major trade city in western Europe."

It's a boogeyman for kids and adults alike, something like an asteroid falling towards France or a nuclear war wiping out humanity, the screaming of sirens as a bad storm hits, the idea of their borders coming any closer terrifies any man, woman, or child.\n\nAll of this doom and gloom there is a dichotomy for the heirs of the ancient Roman settlement of Divio. As the Church goers of this beautiful city go to mass, they pray to Saint Benignus and ask that the Burgundian storm never comes, and that they can continue to live their lives in peace."

It sits at the junction of the Rhône and Saône rivers. Its center reflects 2,000 years of history from the Roman Amphithéâtre des Trois Gaules, and shows its history with medieval and Renaissance architecture in Vieux. The great city of Lyon lays on the core clay of France and is a reminder of the greatness that the nation still has.\n\nWith a population center that helps fuel the nation's strength as well as civilian industry, should fate be kind again to France it can be utilized to make the nation great once more."

Nearly thousand years and many rulers later - the city was controlled by the Burgundians, Spanish, the Austrians, the French, and an independent Belgian kingdom - Brussels is once again under the thumb of Germans ruling from Burgundy. The Nazis made Brussels the capital of a Belgian Reichskommissariat when they invaded, and it remained in place for over a decade. After the West Russian War, the territory was handed over to Heinrich Himmler, for him to reshape into the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund. Despite the disdain of the city's citizens, as well as the Flemish and Walloon SS divisions, Himmler is hellbent on restoring mythical German greatness to the city and all others under his rule."

 state_lore_desc.33: "Unlike many other cities in Ireland, Dublin was not founded by the Irish, or even the English. It was established by Viking raiders in the 10th century, and became the first Norman foothold on the island in 1171. It spent the following 750 years as the center of English, and later British, rule in Ireland, until Irish independence was achieved in 1921.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland selected the city as their capital, the greatest gem in the Emerald Isle's crown. Forty years after that, it is now the capital of an (ostensibly) united island, home to a government up to its neck in sectarian problems."

 state_lore_desc.34: "Although it has been inhabited since the Neolithic era, Belfast was a village of little note until a flood of trade and immigrants in the 17th century. It grew even further in the 19th century and became the heart of Irish industry, though its swelling population led to rising tensions between Catholic and Protestant residents. However, it was still a town dominated by pro-British Unionists, and became the capital of British North Ireland following the south's independence.\n\nThat all changed in the 1940s, when the Germans swept into Britain and the Republic took over the whole island. Belfast now sits on edge, capital of an autonomous zone whose people feel very strongly about their current political status, to say the least."

Truro stands on the western periphery, in Cornwall, of the British Isles. From Truro, you would only need to take a trip to find yourself confronted by the omnipotent, seething waves of the dark, blue Atlantic. Many, during its long and storied history, have gazed into the ocean and thought of what lay on the other side of the barrier. Many cities in the New World were even named after the idyllic Cornish town when its inhabitants finally reached their shores.\n\nTruro can only cling onto those wistful memories now. When the Germans landed on British soil and forced England to bend the knee to the overpowering might of the Nazi Empire, they chose Plymouth as their personal fiefdom to lord over.\n\nWhile Truro is not yet under the Kruppstahl fist of Germania, Halder's men breathe down the neck of the resort town. Gone is the sun that shined down on petite cafes. Gone are the children, from all four corners of the Isles, playing in the streets and grassy knolls of the high street. Gone is the Land of Hope and Glory. All that remains is the undeniable fact that if England was to break free of its chains, the first city that Germania would target will be Truro."

The combined effects of WW2 and the London Uprising have turned vast amounts of the city into rubble and hastily erected shanty towns which remain even years later due to the government's insolvency.\n\nThough landmarks like Big Ben and Buckingham Palace still stand, the marks of shellfire and bullet holes still remain, a fitting representation of the state of England itself."

More so than most of England, the city of Portsmouth is still recovering from the war."

Its once mighty unions suppressed, and the city's industry still attempting recovery, Birmingham has turned into a hub of anti-government sentiment. In Birmingham and Birmingham only, the police officers are forced to travel in guns and in number lest they be ambushed on the streets."

Perhaps more than mere goods as well, for the dockside police don't look too closely at some of the larger shipments contents."

Becoming a centre of smuggling from Scotland, and a necessary stop on the assortment of refugee routes by English dissidents and those who feared what would come if the Germans decided to dispense with a Collaborationist government, Newcastle has become the primary centre of HMMLR operations.

Oslo is Norway's capital, a beautiful city sat at the southernmost tip of the country, home to the busiest ports and the biggest maritime corporations in the world. But, despite its ancient, millenia old beauty, twenty years of Nazi occupation have left ugly gouges in Oslo.\n\nDeemed Aryan enough to save itself from any radical changes more akin to cities like Warsaw, the German mark on Oslo has been left in the form of propaganda posters and a Heer garrison.

Stockholm is primarily known for its unique location across fourteen islands, housing Europe's top universities, and its well-funded and maintained metro. With a storied past spanning back over seven centuries, the grand, beautiful city of Stockholm is the cultural, social, and economical center of Sweden.\n\nStockholm has become a microcosm of Sweden's status in the National Socialist new world order, though - its ports receive both American and German shipping.

Located only 130 kilometers from St. Petersburg, whoever controls the Karelian Isthmus had immense ability to control trade within the Baltic Sea, motivating Russia to captured it in the 18th century.\n\nWith the overthrow of the Tsars, Viipuri found itself the 2nd largest city in the newly independent Finland, a title which it retains to this day. Nearly the entire population fled from the Bolsheviks, who seized the city in 1940, but just a year later, Finnish troops would triumphantly re-enter the city and return the refugees to their old homes.\n\nEver since, Viipuri has been one of the preeminent Finnish ports.

With such a vital strategic role, it took Murmansk just a few years to become humanity's largest city beyond the Arctic Circle.\n\nThough it held against the Axis armies for years, Murmansk ultimately fell during the final months of World War Two, becoming Finland's 2nd largest city. Home to more than a third of the ethnically Russian population in the country, and its isolated location complicating efforts to assimilate its residents, Murmansk is a simmering hotbed of Russian nationalism.

With the arrival of the Wehrmacht and German colonizers, that has changed. They began with the siege, crushing the city with artillery. Then, they broke the city. As food grew sparse, it was decided not all could be fed.\n\nUkrainians starved in the streets of their capital. Then, when the war came to a close, the buildings came back up, now bearing the wound of Germanization upon the Ukrainian psyche, the history of the nation scrubbed away.

Originally baptised as Sevastopol, it collapsed during the unrelenting thunder of Operation Barbarossa in Summer 1942. During the era of the Russian Tsars and Soviet Chairmen, it served as a vital military port for their ambitions in the warm, azure waters of the Black Sea. Yet, despite the proclamations and the speeches of a "New Order" to reign over Europe, Sevastopol kneels under the Nazi banner, in the same way, it did under the Russian.\n\nTheoderichshafen hosts the largest fleet in Europe, if not the world. Under the watchful gaze of its commander, Karl Dönitz, it is the envy of all that knows of it. Today, the citizens of Theoderichshafen continue to live, work and love in the narrow, cobbled streets of the former beach resort.\n\nProud to serve their Fatherland, the German inhabitants stare into the golden horizon - knowing that their grandchildren and their children will play in the same city they did.

The universities have been closed, the churches repurposed, and the construction of vast factory complexes with attached labour camps have completed Kraków's transformation into an industrial nightmare held in a vice grip by the demands of the Reich.\n\nWhile Warsaw's destruction represented to the Polish nation the short term destructiveness of Germany's new order, Kraków's enslavement is a painful reminder of its long term intent to stamp out all that made Poland proud."

A cultural melting pot throughout its history, Bratislava was the capital of the Hungarian Kingdom from 1536 to 1783, and its heritage shows its unique blend of Slavic (Slovak), Hungarian, and German influence.\n\nAs Czechoslovakia collapsed, Bratislava became the capital of Jozef Tiso's fascist Slovak state. Of the major Slavic cities under German hegemony, Bratislava has suffered the least, allowed to continue its steady development into a modern industrial city.

Merged into the single city of 'Budapest' to become the new Hungarian capital in 1873, the city flourished, quickly becoming one of the largest and most prosperous cities in Europe.\n\nThe vast Hungarian conquests of the Second World War only increased its prosperity, but the extermination of much of the city's Jews, the devastating war with Romania and Slovakia, and the economic crash of the 1950s, have recently plunged the city into jeopardy.

The discovery of the nearby Oil Fields turned Bucharest into a bonafide economic powerhouse, which has continued its ceaseless expansion in both population and riches ever since.\n\nNow the 3rd largest city in the Balkans, behind only Istanbul and Athens, the people and resources of Bucharest are widely coveted by Romania's neighbors.

In just 30 years, the City of White Stone escaped the Russian yoke to become independent, was taken by Romania and retaken by Russia, and once again came under Romanian control in the Second World War. Most are comfortable with this situation: The people of Chișinău largely speak Romanian and enjoy the same standards of living as their brethren in Bucharest, but as a legacy of its history, Chișinău and the surrounding province of Moldova is far more ethnically diverse than the rest of Romania.\n\nThousands of Russians, Ukrainians, and Bulgarians, as well as most of the world's Gagauz people, call this place home. This uniquely multicultural environment in an increasingly segregated Europe has distinguished the society of Chișinău from that of any other Romanian city."

The birthplace of Ustaše and the primary center of Croatian culture, Zagreb flourished in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nBut since the war, fascist government has ruthlessly oppressed the non-Croat minorities in the city, while communist rebels continue their campaign in the countryside. In part because of this violence, an increasing number of Croats have immigrated to Zagreb in recent years.\n\nBut while the city grows, its economy stagnates, corroded by violence, incompetent bureaucracy, and Italian pressure.

Founded in 1461 to serve as a regional power center for the Ottoman Empire, Sarajevo quickly developed into one of the largest and most religiously and culturally diverse cities of the Balkans. Orthodox Christians, Catholics, and Muslims, have lived side-by-side here for centuries.\n\nIt was here that the Archduke Franz-Ferdinand was assassinated, heralding the beginning of World War One and all the later conflicts of the 20th century, which would plunge Sarajevo and its people into chaos.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Ustaše conducted a genocide of Serbs in its territory, exterminating over a tenth of Sarajevo's pre-war population, and creating severe ethnic tensions between the once harmonious Croat and Serbian peoples which continue to this day.

One of the largest cities of the Roman Balkans, Sofia was reduced to a population of only a few thousand by 1880, a victim of frequent war and economic turmoil. Intensive government investment in industry and infrastructure since independence in 1878 has revived Sofia's fortunes, and it is once again one of the largest cities of the Balkans.\n\nHaving emerged from the Second World War relatively unscathed, Sofia has developed into a bastion of unusual stability and independence in a region dominated by instability, ethnic conflict, and foreign domination."

Following an influx of Greek Christians from Asia Minor which had already made Jews a minority in the city, the Germans killed and displaced the entire Jewish community during the Second World War.\n\nThe city does not only stand as a monument to Nazi depravity, however. Despite its relatively recent entry into Greece from its former master, the Ottomans, it has served as the center of a rival government during much of the First World War and commands trade in the Aegean Sea.

Two hundred and more years ago it was one of the world's greatest nexus of commerce; forty years ago, the flaming nucleus of the Kuomintang white sun. Yet as the murky tides of time flow, foam, and clash, eventually it would be neither of those currents under which the pearl would find itself interred.\n\nInstead, when the dust of the Second Sino-Japanese War settled, it found itself, as the rest of Asia did, at the mercy of the New Order. It was to be reforged from the ground up, decreed the new Japanese masters, into a brand new hub of technological might, a brand new capital of a brand new state, in which possibilities shall branch and blossom until only infinity remains. The city today known as Kōshu gleams not with the vigor of life, but with incandescent bulbs - their light, fluttering and seeping through the billboards, the overcrowded housing blocks, and the noxious smog that have come to define its skyline.\n\nIn the few parts of the city that could be considered healthier to live in, Japanese contractors, foremen, and business professionals cluster together, trying to block out the view of the rest of the city; it matters to few - if any - of them how many of the Chinese majority lost their limbs today.

The Japanese brought with them their language, their people - who now form nearly 30% of the city- and, most importantly, their ruthless corporate mentality.\n\nIt is here that black-suited men in air conditioned rooms decide the policies that keep countless millions enslaved for the brutal machine that supplies all of the Sphere, here that fortunes are made on scales unimaginable by the ordinary man - here that vicious battles are fought in boardrooms masked by the sanitized language of the business world.\n\nYet it is here that the people work tirelessly, defiantly dreaming of a better tomorrow through hard work despite feeling the corporate boot on their necks. Where the fishermen still cast their nets, where the restless student plays football with their friends, where the elderly dine with their grandchildren. The rat race consumes all, but the people find ways to briefly escape from it.\n\nThe Fragrant Harbor of the Three Pearls, as beautiful and vibrant as it is cruel and merciless, Honkon is the primary financial and business hub - a place where the squalor, violence and cruelty of the rest of Guangdong cannot be seen through the tall windows of gleaming glass skyscrapers."

The lucrative port had been embroiled in conflicts of envy and rivalry, yet it would not be the Dutch or the British who would wrestle the territory away from the authority of Portugal, but instead, the ascendant rising sun of Japan and the rapacious corporations of Guangdong.\n\nThe Macau of today is a city defined by its gambling houses and vivacious neon lights; a hectic maelstrom of underground activity and carefree gaming, where fortunes are gained and lost according to the numbers of a roulette wheel; the modest Portuguese port of the past had been relegated to the annals of history."

When Peter the Great established it, he called it Sankt-Pieter-Burch, then he had it renamed to Saint Petersburg. In 1914, it was renamed Petrograd; in 1924 it was renamed Leningrad after the death of Lenin. After the conquest, it returned to the German translation of its original name.\n\nThe old city - a fusion of Western European and Russian inspirations - was utterly razed after the war and rebuilt in the Nazi fashion. As in the case of Moskau, countless workers and ordinary people in the city centre were forced to the suburbs. But since many of those involved in the rebuilding were allowed to remain after its completion, the segregation and mobility restrictions are less strict. Just like in Moskau, however, the industrial genocide continues; many ethnic Russians are worked to death in the city so they can be replaced with members of the German "master race"."

By the 1800s, this fortress had become an important Volga riverport and commercial centre, which caused a population explosion. In 1917, Tsaritsyn fell under Soviet control, but the Whites fought hard to regain control over it for three years. Five years after the Whites were defeated, the city was named Stalingrad for Iosef Stalin, who played a key role in the battle; it was known by this name until Field Marshal Paulus conquered the city during the Second World War.\n\nNowadays, Paulusburg is the second centre of the Moskowien administration after Moskau. Half of it was razed and rebuilt completely to suit German aims. Countless Russians were expelled to the hinterlands or forced to work themselves to the bone in factories, leaving Paulusburg as the city most dominated by the Germans in all of Moskowien."

The Kremlin and other historical buildings, rather than being destroyed, were replaced with Nazi imagery.

After cresting the Andes, it would continue over the vast coastal desert that dominates the north of the nation. Suddenly, from the monotonous sandy plain of the Atacama, rises pillars of glass and steel. This is Antofagasta, a city that men have fought and died for.\n\nAntofagasta in its modern role serves as the center of the sizable Chilean mining industry, and it has always been a desired jewel of the Andean nations. Originally a Bolivian nitrate mining settlement, the nascent "La Chimba" was the center of a massive Chilean immagration wave in the mid-to-late 1800s.\n\nA lucrative mining town with a large ethnic minority on an international border was, unsurprisingly, a center of conflict. Growing tension between Chile and Bolivia over territorial disputes and a Bolivian tax on Chilean nitrate mining companies would culminate in the 4 year long War of the Pacific. Chile, despite the odds, defeated the combined Bolivian and Peruvian armies over the course of the war, ultimately gaining the resource-rich Bolivian coastline, including the city of Antofagasta.\n\nNow, Antofagasta is the center of one of the world's largest nitrate and copper mining operations, and modern innovations in the field of electrochemistry mean that the mining companies have begun to tap into the region's large lithium reserves. Antofagasta, it would seem, is a city on the rise, and a worthy holder of the title of "La Perla del Norte"-- The Pearl of the North."

Though disrupted and perturbed by the changes in the geopolitical order, the vast Chilean maritime industry continues to churn, bringing dwindling income to the city, but endless nets of fish.\n\nValparaíso itself languishes in the way that only a port city past its golden era can. Many of the city's famed funiculars no longer run; its labyrinthian cobblestone streets are no longer safe to wander. Without any major investment or attention, the city has slid into grime and alienation. With grime and alienation come extremism, and Valparaíso thus serves as the center of the Chilean socialist movement: the dockworker's union is known to be one of the most volatile and ideologically driven in the nation, leading many strikes and demonstrations.\n\nAmidst the red banners and aging shipyards, ships marked with the white torch of the OFN dock at the city's port daily. To liberal-minded Chileans, this showcases the collaborative relationship between Chile and the United States, and is evidence of strong foregin investment. To Chileans dissatisfied with the status-quo, it is undue American exploitation of Chile's natural bounty. Valparaíso may have lost its luster as a jewel, but it is still a vital center of the Chilean economy and culture; even the most cynical citizen of Valpo still has dreams of a gleaming city."

Protesters sport armbands of every color and slogans of every persuasion, and their fiery passion seems ready to spark the city into an unstoppable blaze.\n\nWhether Santigo is turned to ash or saved from the heat of extremism does not matter much to the soul of the city; Santiago has been razed and had its earth salted many times, and each time it has rebuilt itself grander than the last, with an undying defiance towards nihilism and death.\n\nIt has been said that Chile has found stability in misery.

Founded by Pedro de Valdivia, a conquistador and the first governor of Chile, the city was a vital military settlement only miles from the land of the Mapuche; the city's destruction in 1554 was inevitable, and the Spanish retributions unto the Mapuche doubly so.\n\nThe death dealt in the Arauco War with the Mapuche would come to haunt Concepción, as the city would be faced with massive earthquakes. In particular, the 1939 and 1960 earthquakes were some of the most powerful ever recorded, and both brought the city to lows it had not felt in centuries. The other side of the claret motif, however, is that pumping blood necessitates a heart-- Concepción prospers despite it all. It has never failed to rebuild itself, unflinching in the face of rending earth or fiery war.\n\nFollowing the Arauco War, Concepción quickly realigned itself from a military city to a cultural one, and its meteoric economic rise has made Concepción the undeniable beating heart of southern Chile. Despite the Mapuche razing the city two separate times, despite the endless march of heaving earth, despite the economic and political woes of Chile as a whole and the South in particular, Concepción stands tall and strong as a symbol and leader of southern Chile."

Guarding the strategic Strait of Magellan, Punta Arenas is one of the southernmost cities on Earth, and it is therefore vital in terms of power projection across the Strait of Magellan.\n\nPunta Arenas' strategic location was not lost on European powers of the Victorian Age, and despite Chilean claims on the region, both the British and French sent a series of expeditions to the region attempting to gain control. President Manuel Bulnes of Chile, attempting to reassert Chilean claims, established Fort Bulnes in 1843. The Chileans arrived a single day before the French, who themselves were narrowly ahead of the British. Had they arrived any later, the city may have been named Sandy Point or Point de Sable instead of Punta Arenas.\n\nFort Bulnes, over time, outgrew the rocky outcropping on which it was established, and in 1848, it was reestablished on the banks of the nearby river Las Minas as the part-penal colony, part-civilian settlement Punta Arenas. The city's location on the undisputed center of Atlantic-Pacific trade as well as the discovery of gold contributed to the city's massive growth in the late 1800s, and while the opening of the Panama Canal caused the city to fall from its mercantile apoapsis and stagnate, it is still a city of key strategic and cultural importance.

Its somewhat developed state, being the "beacon of a powerful nation," a great city for its region, was a stark contrast to the rest of the starving and deprived nation, with Sukarno's ever increasing sense of pride driving the city itself forward, leaving the rest of the nation and most of its people in the dust.

The Sultan oversees a city eager to be thrust towards the tides of tomorrow, a paragon of education and excellence, home to a sizable student population who will embody the nation's future.\n\nA framed picture depicting the history of a people, and yet the horizons remain unclear.

Its favorable position allowed it to be surrounded by lucrative and lush plantations, followed by the series of factories that accompanied the arrival of the Industrial era.\n\nWith the expulsion of the Dutch and the ushering in of supposed independence, Surabaja still retains its status as a hub of commerce and trade, a symbol of the opulence which this island brings."

Independence movements and guerilla forces plagued the peninsula as the Japanese fought back with greater and greater force, with some insurgents even spreading to areas of outer Manchuria.\n\nPerhaps it is here, in Keijō, that this cycle was avoided, and its goals of Japanization and industrialization met in some aspects.

Even after the revolutionary Xinhai Revolution, Changsha remained very commercial in nature and its industry was rather meager.\n\nBeing the birthplace of Mao Zedong, Changsha was a strong communist stronghold until a Kuomintang purge in 1927 killed thousands of suspected communists and revolutionaries. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese were able to recognize Changsha's strategic importance as the crossroads of southern China. Changsha came under near-constant assault, having 4 campaigns launched against it by the Imperial Japanese Army, eventually capturing the city in 1944. The city was left devastated.

While the nearby city of Chongqing may steal the spotlight occasionally, nobody can deny Chengdu's vital position in the center of the Sichuan Basin. In any Chinese dynasty, Chengdu almost always headed Sichuan, and sometimes even the central government.\n\nIn the Second Sino-Japanese War, while Chongqing headed the government and military high command, Chengdu provided refuge to many military headquarters and provided a safe place for armies to regroup, if the skies stayed clear that is. Chongqing and Chengdu faced almost constant bombardment by Japanese bombers during the war, with the Chinese airforce unable to provide significant resistance. With Japanese boots in Chengdu by 1947, they found themselves in a city of rubble.\n\nWhile the city's large population and the plentiful resources of the Sichuan Basin resulted in a speedy recovery for Chengdu, being more than 800 miles away from Nanjing meant that when Japanese forces left China and the RGOC took over occupation, resistance cells activated en-masse. Communists, Nationalists, peasants, bandits, and countless more rise against the central government for a Free China, or simply for their own personal benefit.

With a history dating back at least 3,000 years, Chongqing has often been at the center of Chinese politics, with many governments having the city as their head. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chiang's Kuomintang was one such government. Being the head of operations for the Chinese and American armies in China and South East Asia, Chongqing faced heavy bombing by the Japanese. While much of the population was able to take refuge in air-raid shelters, the cities industry was hit hard by Japanese attacks, and when Japanese troops finally occupied the city during the waning stages of the war, there wasn't much left.\n\nOf course, Chongqing's population wasn't content with a ruined city. Chongqing's position in the Sichuan basin gave it ample resources to rebuild, and together with its large population, Chongqing was able to rebuild faster than most Chinese cities. Of course, to end here would be telling only half of the story.\n\nFar away from Nanjing and the central government, Sichuan has often been difficult for the RGOC to control. Communist guerillas, Kuomintang hold-outs, and unhappy peasants are in near-constant uprising and make Chongqing's wealth much harder for the central government to exploit. Unlike in other provinces, such as Shanxi, Nanjing is much more unwilling to give the riches of Sichuan to a power-hungry warlord. This arrangement means that while Chongqing is a city full of wealth and industry, it goes unused and unavailable. Controlling Chongqing, and by extension, the Sichuan basin, is a requirement for any Chinese government to succeed."

In 1933, NRA splitters set up the short-lived Fujian People's Government, but with a blockade from the central government and the nearby Jiangxi-Fujian Soviet providing no support, it fell quickly.\n\nIn 1937 the Second Sino-Japanese War descended on China, and by extension Fuzhou. In early May 1938, the nearby town of Xiamen fell to Japanese troops, directly threatening Fuzhou. Naval and aerial combat continued in and around Fuzhou for another month, eventually ending with the city falling to Japanese forces.\n\nUnlike other cities in China, the effects of the Second Sino-Japanese War on Fuzhou were minimal.

That was until 1919 and the advent of the 21 demands, seeing Japan cement its hold over German operations in Shandong, including the vital Jiaoji railway that connected Jinan to the sea. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Jinan was targeted early on in the war due to its strategic importance.\n\nIn late 1937, the Japanese crossed the Yellow River and began marching towards the city. Chinese troops abandoned Jinan and were ordered to burn down government buildings, as well as the Japanese consulate. The ensuing power vacuum led to Jinan descending into chaos. Japanese forces arrived in the city less than a week later, quelling the chaos and beginning their harsh occupation. Jinan, being developed by both German and Japanese investors in years past, had large industries that the Japanese took full advantage of for their war effort.\n\nAfter the Japanese war economy began to demobilize and move out of the area, failings of the new central government began to arise. While Jinan may have been an industrial stronghold, corrupt governance, ineffective development, and pure incompetency riddled much of the RGOC's early governance of the area and left the economy of Jinan stagnant for years."

Under his rule, Taiyuan's industries flourished, and the Taiyuan Arsenal quickly became one of the largest in China.\n\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, the combined forces of Yan Xishan and Communist general Zhu De were able to put up stiff resistance to the Japanese in Taiyuan, with the Japanese remarking that "nowhere in China have the Chinese fought so obstinately". After the capture of Taiyuan in late 1937, the Japanese exploited Taiyuan to its fullest extent. Taiyuan was able to supply the IJA well in its campaigns to root out the Communist base areas in Northern China. Taiyuan saw little growth during this time, as resources and material were shipped out of the mountains of Shanxi and into the war machine of Japan. Due to its manufacturing importance, Taiyuan was going to be an important city for the new central government to control.\n\nUnfortunately for the RGOC, the situation on the ground was becoming less and less favorable for the central government. Unable to control the outer reaches of China, the new government allied with Yan Xishan, granting him de facto control of the province. With Yan now dead, Fu Zuoyi ruled as his successor and proved to be much more conservative than Yan.

In 1936, with war with the Japanese on the horizon, the Chinese Civil War officially came to an end with the Xi'an incident seeing the formation of the Second United Front, with the Communists and Nationalists uniting against Japan.\n\nIn the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Xi'an saw heavy bombardment as Japan faced fierce resistance in the mountains of Shaanxi and Shanxi by the Communist Eighth Route Army.

When the Northern Expedition reached Jiangsu, the Kuomintang government fought back and forth with local warlords and Beiyang splitters. Eventually coming under the control of the KMT in late 1927, Xuzhou was looking to be an important city for the government to occupy if they wanted to stay in control of the lands around the Yellow River.\n\nIn 1938, with the Second Sino-Japanese War in full swing, the Japanese army descended on Xuzhou, sending panic through Chinese high command. The defense of Xuzhou was rushed, and while they showed early success in nearby battles, the situation was determined unwinnable and orders for a general retreat were given. Chinese forces breached the dykes holding back the Yellow River to cover their retreat, and the consequential 1938 Yellow River Flood destroyed much of Xuzhou and other nearby settlements.\n\nMore than 20 years after the horrific flood that flattened the city, Xuzhou is once more a jewel of the North China Plain, but to call the wounds of the Second Sino-Japanese War healed would be inaccurate.

This is not to be unfair to modern Iquique; a wave of European immagration in the early 20th century as well as the city being declared one of Chile's two free ports led to immense development of the city.

Sugar, tobacco, hardwood, alcohol, and cigars are the city's staples, but Villahermosa's beauty and rich pre-colonial history have made the city a growing tourist attraction."

León was occupied by the French for three years and celebrated the visit from Maximilian I in 1846. Multiple people were wounded by government soldiers following the city's liberation. Almost a century later, a group of students were killed for protesting the election of Bonifacio Salinas.\n\nLeón is known as the "footwear capital of Mexico" as a majority of the country's shoes come from the city.

Founded in 1563 as a town meant for mining silver, the city instead grew around the large iron deposits of Cerro de Mercado. The mining bonanza led to the construction of many colonial-era mansions in the city's center.\n\nDuring the War of Independence, many leaders were executed in Durango on July 17th, 1812. Durango joined the Mexican Revolution in 1911, but its capture and burning by insurgents in 1913 plunged the city into a decades-long depression. Recovery has only begun in the past decade as droughts and industrial development pushed rural migrants into Durango."

Founded at the intersection of the rivers Chuviscar and Sacramento, Chihuahua is nothing more than an agricultural center; it's simply a trading post for cattle on their way to the Golden Arches of the United States.\n\nWhen visiting the dusty, neon-stained downtown, lined with nothing but 12-foot glowing signs advertising a fermented escape, it is impossible to conceptualize the past and the future both of this city.\n\nChihuahua, behind its deceptive haze of lotus-eater-urban-ruralism, has been everything from the capital for Benito Juárez's government-in-exile to the headquarters of Pancho Villa's División del Norte. It has been the unwilling host to Miguel Hidalgo when he faced execution. It served as the de facto capital of Nueva Vizcaya, the first province of New Spain to be settled. Even the name "Chihuahua" is ancient, far older than the Spanish conquest; it comes from the Nahuatl language, and it fittingly means "between two waters." This moment in the city's history, the image of a desert Sodom meant only for the desperate and the foolish, this is only a momentary embarrassment.\n\nThe historical city of bankers and businessmen from the era of Porfirio Díaz will return, and with increasing American business opportunities just north of the border (and a few manufacturing plants just south of it), it is sure to return faster than anyone expected."

The name of both city and state is half derived from Louis IX, the saint and King of France, and half confusingly derived from the Bolivian city of Potosí (the logic of that being based on the hope that the nearby mines would become as deep and rich as the famously wealthy mines of Potosí, Bolivia).\n\nThe sprawling city is home and host to some of the key elements of the Mexican manufacturing industry, and its position at the heart of the triangle formed by Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey have secured its place as an economically vital city with a high standard of living. Historically, the region has been referred to as "El Gran Tunal", or "The Great Prickly Pear" due to the force with which the native people resisted the Spanish tide, and while the city is far from the days of conquistador and missionary, the people of SLP still hold their heads high with pride in their city.

Following the assassination of Francisco Madero in 1913, Venustiano Carranza began his Constitutionalist Movement in Hermosillo, which led to the city being dubbed as "the revolutionary capital of the country." Hermosillo remains economically isolated from the rest of Mexico and the world at large, but its proximity to the Pacific and the American border has led to increasing interest from American and Japanese investors, who'll hopefully bring the city into the modern era."

Of course, that's not all. Montevideo also finds itself as the den of a global espionage ring.

Yet, some residents have a better inscription for the sign. "Welcome to Ushuaia. Welcome to the End of the World". Home to the Yaghan people, for most of history, Ushuaia served as any other spot in the bottom end of the Southern Cone, as a place where natives lived and died. Faced with bracing winters, and humid summers, Ushuaia is not an easy place to live in. Yet, it has transformed into something else.\n\nSomething much stranger, and more powerful than the former fishing village ever expected. Ushuaia has been turned into a chess piece, in a long and very intricate game against Chile. Argentina and Chile both demand and require the coveted title of "most Southern city in the world". While at first this may just seem like a vanity project, this "competition" has real, tangible consequences. The winner would have control over the entire Strait of Magellan, and all the trade that goes around it. While the Strait has been made mostly redundant due to the Panama Canal, much intercontinental trade - and naval ships - still pass through the region. Whoever the winner is, the townsfolk of Ushuaia will continue as they did 10,000 years before. At the end of the world."

Along with its beautiful riverside attractions, visitors often are caught up in the pomp and dazzle of military parade and guardsmen in service.\n\nIn contrast to the rest of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the citizens of Bangkok sleep well knowing that no Japanese occupier will show up uninvited due to Thailand's independent status in Tōkyō's political and military alliance, allowing the city to expand rapidly in numbers and wealth."

However, few realize that Hanoi is one of the biggest powder kegs in all eastern Asia.\n\nDuring the Japanese invasion of French Indochina, Hanoi became the birthplace of the Viet Minh movement, and from its countryside they started an insurgency that lasted years and saw the city almost conquered from Japanese forces. Today Hanoi keeps a facade of peacefulness, while its streets are patrolled day and night by the IJA, and the Viet Minh prepare for their final struggle behind closed doors. And one day, Hanoi will let the world know who is actually in charge in Vietnam."

Dubbed the pearl of the orient, its unique architecture and colonial history blended together to form a picturesque landscape that not many others could replicate.\n\nIf one were to pass through the city and take a gaze to their surroundings, concrete American tenements lay side to side with ancient Spanish forts and villas, forming a mosaic that molded the city into a window to the past with a touch of modernity bringing it to perfection.\n\nSeen on top of these sights are reminders of the last war, but one would have to squint their eyes to find them. Layered upon the destruction that the war brought are influences of the Japanese occupation. Highrises, temples, and starburst flags can be seen dotted about the city.

Then, the Mekong delta was conquered by the Empire of Vietnam and the town renamed to Saigon. Under French Indochina, Saigon began its rapid development from small harbor to a large town for the colonial administration.\n\nThe urbanization process continued even after France left Indochina, as Japan tried to turn the city into a shining example of Pan-Asianism. However, Saigon is still a city full of contradictions: its slums are home to prostitutes, drug addicts, beggars, and orphans; while in the old city center, with its grand French colonial buildings and rational boulevards, corrupt officials and Japanese with money make deals. There is much work to be done before Saigon can become a functioning, modern city."

As such, even after the nation's sudden independence and the ignoble ends of those feudal realms, the city forms the core of the new Republic's policies in the South and remains hotly contested between establishment Congress stalwarts and the growing 'Dravidian' movement, between Telugu and Tamil linguistic movements, and even hosting a significant Forward Bloc subparty.\n\nEven outside the political realm, Madras is one of the most rapidly industrialising cities in the south, with several significant architectural and development projects planned in and around it.

And yet, though the former Nizam may have been possibly the richest man in the world, his subjects languished under a feudal system that was downright mediaeval - a state of affairs that lasted unchanged till the sudden, ignoble end of the Raj herself. Suddenly free from obligation to an imperial overlord, the Nizam attempted to seize his independence and march Hyderabad onto the world stage as a nation of its own - until the Indian National Army marched to his borders, and he realised that obligations were not all he had lost - there was no longer any British Army to protect him from his own subjects.\n\nNow, Hyderabad exists as the grand capital of a nonexistent kingdom, the administrative centre of a state melding several linguistic minorities that seek to join states of their own majority or separate entirely, and a major centre of both Communist and (underground) Forward Bloc support within the Republic of India.

Nevertheless, it is the second most populous city in the country and one of the most productive, owing to the canals that connect the city to the Mississippi river. The area around Chicago was an important portage used by Native Americans for thousands of years for travel and trade, which in turn attracted settlers from the East coast and Louisiana. The city of Chicago went from having a population of 200 at the time of its founding to 110,000 in the span of a few decades. But in 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed much of the city, and from the ruins of the previous wooden structures arose a new metropolis, with modern constructions of steel and concrete, like the world's first steel-framed skyscraper.\n\nCurrently, Chicago is the foremost industrial and economic center in the Great Lakes, from its mills come out the steel used for tanks and planes for the US Armed Forces, but also for the cars and buildings used by the American people. This in turn requires large numbers of people to be employed as workforce, which is why Chicago is also one of the most prominent destinations for immigrants in the country. Since the 19th century, Chicago has been home to several ethnicities like the Irish, Germans, Eastern Europeans, and even black Americans, although issues like redlining and blockbusting remain prominent among black neighborhoods."

It is also one of the most important cities in American history, in particular during the Revolution against the English crown, being the scene of several key events such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, and the battle of Bunker Hill. The city is also one of the busiest ports in the northern Atlantic, which became the arrival point of many Irish immigrants looking for a better life on America's shores, in one of the first waves of migration that have shaped American society.\n\nThe Boston of today is a liberal bastion in America, owing to its large presence of college students enrolled in Harvard, and to the multicultural composition of the city inhabitants. Boston is usually associated with Irish migrants and their descendants, and among them one family stands above all, the Kennedys, who have dominated the Democratic Party scene since Joseph Kennedy Sr's political career. While Kennedy Sr is a controversial figure, he has kept alive the flame of liberalism in America, and his children, John F. and Robert F., are doing the same for the country. Perhaps if one of them were to rise up to the Presidency, Boston would become the birthplace of the first Irish American President, a great honor even for a city with such a long and rich history."

Founded in the early 19th century, Atlanta was a small town with less than 10,000 people, known for being a major railway terminus in the Southeast. This made it an important logistic hub during the Civil War, until general Sherman burnt the entire city down during his March to the Sea. But like the Phoenix reborn from its ashes, the people of Atlanta rebuilt the city during the Reconstruction, and the population skyrocketed as a consequence.\n\nToday Atlanta is a vibrant city with a large economy, hosting the headquarters of companies such as Coca Cola and Delta Air Lines, but beneath the façade lie simmering racial issues, with over 40 percent of the city population black and living under Jim Crow. Despite this, the black community of Atlanta has always strived to carve its own place in the city, by starting their own businesses; teaching in their own colleges; and campaigning against segregation. One black man in particular stands out in the fight for civil rights, Martin Luther King Jr, an Atlanta native who has brought the issues that black Americans face on a nationwide scale. Atlanta is in many ways a mirror of the South, a place of genuine Southern hospitality afflicted by racism, but it is also the only place where real change feels possible, and all its black citizens hope that one day they can claim the city as their own."

No, it is the warm, sprawling city of Houston. Named after the Revolutionary Hero himself, General Sam Houston who led Texas' people to shatter the shackles of Mexican tyranny, Houston continues to shine bright in the Lone Star State, above all else.\n\nWhy? Because Houston has a secret weapon that sets itself apart. After the unparalleled devastation of the 1900 Galveston Hurricane, a peculiar discovery was made on the outskirts of the ruined metropolis. Oil - barrels upon barrels of it. Following the discovery at Spindletop, thousands flocked to the area to dig deep and dig greedily for the elusive Black Gold inside the Red Sands of the Gulf. What was once an industrial mining town, became a haven for entrepreneurs, down-and-outers and the huddled masses that had been ground up by the East Coast Establishment. Houston, with its chaos and its noise, does not have a New Colossus to parade itself around with.

Today, the glory days of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush are long gone, and the only relic of those times is the distinctive golden dome of the State Capitol building, shining like a jewel in the city's skyline.\n\nA progressive beacon in America's heartland, Denver was one of the first cities to set up a civil rights commission, and one of the few in the country to provide fair public housing to Latinos, African-Americans, and Japanese-Americans.

While the Empress walks and talks like a goddess, her courtesans make their final bows.

The colossal port - that once was its source of power - has been supplanted by other ports, near and far; with the banking industry retreating out of the state to more prosperous shores. Regardless, New Orleans stands tall, her back straight and her eyes to the horizon.

A fact distinctly exemplified by the newly built Space Needle, an unmistakable sight in the city's skyline. The city's docks, however, remain barren.

Originally nothing more than a tiny settlement comprising an ancient fortress surrounded by a row of impromptu housing, the city would remain as such until the arrival of the fleeing al-Dawasir tribe from the isle of Bahrain. Yet it would only be with the arrival of the Arab-American Oil Company, almost two decades later, that the meagre locality would grow to become one of the Saudi Kingdom's most significant industrial cities as their discovery of petroleum reserves within the city's vicinity brought to it much needed attention from both the government and investors alike. Workers from across Arabia flood into the city, clouds of smoke rise into the city's sky, and streams of oil flow from beneath the ground as the chimes of industry continue to sound within the streets of the bustling city. While Dammam may grow and prosper into one of the Saudi state's most pristine metropolises, its lifeline has also proven to be its main curse, as the often-disgruntled workers of the Oil Industry continue to sow discord within the young city's foundations."

Sydney's Indigenous Australians, having endured the harsh yellow sun for thousands of years, suffering the weight of iron collars, stolen generations, and other policies of genocide, persist and will persist yet.

Heavily valued by Spain for its mineral wealth as well as its strategic position, the city was also so thoroughly admired by King Phillip II that it was granted the titles of "muy leal" and "muy noble", or very good and very noble respectively.\n\nWith the onset of the war for Mexican independence, the people of Zacatecas proved themselves among the best and bravest of Mexico's patriotic revolutionaries, joining with Hidalgo's insurrection just days after the mythic Cry of Dolores, where it would succeed in fighting off the Spanish for a decade, eventually winning its independence from Spain along with Mexico, becoming the capital of the new and free state of Zacatecas in 1823.\n\nDuring the era of the 19th century, Zacatecas would become a growing center for the arts as part of a series of rapid modernization under the dictatorship of the Porfiriato, one that would be interrupted by the Mexican Revolution, where the city would become the site of the legendary, day-long battle where Pancho Villa's rebels triumphed over the army of Victoriano Huerta, considered by many to be the most important as one of the greatest and bloodiest battles in the revolution.\n\nIn the later half of the 20th century, the city has fallen of rough times; Mexican Revolution caused enough damage to the city to trigger a demographic freefall and atrophy, with parts of the city appearing almost abandoned, this lack of development crippled the economy of the city and lead to decades recession and decline, both made worse with the depletion of the cities silver deposits and little in the form of international aide.\n\nNot all is bleak in Zacatecas, however; the lack of development in the city allowed for it to retain a much older and more traditionally Mexican visual appearance and aesthetic, which has since allowed for the city to attempt to transition its economy towards tourism and commerce, with slow but moderate success."

The discovery of oil has made it the center of the city's economy, which has also become the focus of Alberta's disputes with the government. The free spirit of Calgary represents the growing rift between Ontario and the west, and its citizens wonder if they'll ever be seen truly equally."

 state_lore_desc.200: "Vancouver was always a city that was dominated by trade. Incorporated as a city in 1886, Vancouver's connection to the Canadian Pacific Railroad that same year made it Canada's preeminent port of the West Coast. This opened the city to international trade and the city grew in wealth and size because of this trade.\n\nBut the end of the Second World War and the division of the world between fascist regimes and democracies signaled a decline for Vancouver. When the United States led the OFN to embargo the Co-Prosperity Sphere in the 50's, Pacific trade dried up and now every year fewer and fewer ships pass through the Port of Vancouver. It would take a drastic change in policy to improve this sorry state of affairs."

Despite the economic downturn caused by the loss of World War 2 and the Nixon Shock, Toronto has still rapidly grown as both migrants, immigrants, and refugees are drawn to the city's allure of prosperity. Toronto excels in finance, industry, and technology. Its cultural centers showcase art from dozens of countries. Its sports teams rival the Americans in spirit.

Halifax was founded in 1749, and the creation of the city immediately started a war with the Mi'kmaq peoples. In 1917, Halifax saw one of the greatest disasters in Canadian history when the French munitions ship SS Mont-Blanc detonated after colliding with another vessel. The blast caused 11,000 casualties. Aid from Boston forever tied the two cities together as a symbol of unity between the States and Canada.

American and Confederate flags flutter from the windows of old, three-story mansions. Women in mink coats chat outside Neiman Marcus, clutching pamphlets from the John Birch Society between their jeweled fingers. Just off Main Street, past the Romanesque court house, Dallas's pristine brick and concrete give way to clusters of falling-down shacks with no running water, their foundations sinking into the floodplain. On a cracked and staple-pricked telephone pole in the Fort Worth Stockyards hangs a poster reading, "SAVE YOUR RACE. JOIN THE AMERICAN NATIONAL VANGUARD."\n\nNot all are infatuated with these ideas of course. There are many Americans across the Metroplex opposed to the likes of Ted Dealey, whose ultra-conservative paper castigates Nixon and Kennedy as allies of socialism, communism, and the pope. There are many who march in opposition of the completely segregated school system, even as the powerful Baptist preacher W. A. Criswell snarls about the threat of the NAACP and CPUSA. Still, it is difficult to escape the atmosphere of white rage consuming this one-time headquarters of the KKK. Soon, the radicals here might do more than just talk.

What was once a tiny farming community has exponentially exploded with the arrival of the railroads, the dams, the military bases, and the technology industry.\n\nMade possible through the wonders of air conditioning and the automobile, Phoenix represents the new American city of the 20th century. A center of modern skyscrapers and office buildings, surrounded by endless fields of developed housing, where each family can have a lawn and a carport. And every major American baseball team comes here to take advantage of the good pre-season weather and do some spring training.\n\nBut Phoenix is more than the picturesque representation of modern life in the land of the free. The ancestral lands of the tribes that populated the area are being dug up, the African American population redlined beyond the golf course, and the increasing quantities of auto traffic become bigger and bigger headaches. Indeed, Phoenix is the present of America, but it remains to be seen if that's good or bad."

From there, it winds downstream, picking up width and speed until it turns into the force of God that defines the lands around it. It's during this early stage that the Old Man River cuts through the Twin Cities - Minneapolis and Saint Paul.\n\nMinneapolis began as land on a military base. Saint Paul was a collection of small villages. Saint Paul is the last city in the East, they say, and Minneapolis is the first city in the West. Minneapolis styles itself with urban renewal and modern architecture while Saint Paul maintains a classic Victorian style. The cities may be split physically by the river and their many differences, but their inexorable ties to one another have grown and flourished, developing a rich history and culture forged by freezing temperatures. Together they share the 7-time champion Golden Gophers, the newly founded Vikings, and the aptly named Twins, as well as economic prosperity and a strong hold over state politics.\n\nEven in the Minnesota cold, the heated rivalry between the two cities has defined their histories to the point of competitive cathedral building, architectural blacklisting, and even the kidnapping of census takers to prevent one city from being deemed larger than the other. Yet today, the internal troubles of each city is the focus of much concern. Both cities contend with unofficial segregation and deep roots of discrimination, despite their liberal tendencies. Both cities struggle with declining populations and labor disputes. Both cities pour effort into distinguishing themselves among the manufacturing metropolises of the Midwest who so often command the attention of America.\n\nStill, through the blizzards and tornadoes, the strikes and the riots, the decline of industry and the tensions of the Cold War, Minneapolis-Saint Paul endures and innovates.

 state_lore_desc.208: "In the days of the pioneers and the Oregon Trail, families from the East traveled into the great frontier of the American west, unsure of what lay ahead of them. For many, their last place of rest and preparation before the venture was in a blooming town on the Missouri River. This is the city of Omaha, Nebraska, the Gateway to the West.\n\nOmaha is the second-largest city on the Great Plains today, home to over 300,000 people and swiftly rising. The imposing brick silhouettes of Jobbers Canyon form the heart of the burgeoning meatpacking and agricultural industry which dominates the local economy, while the golden fields of the Big O's surroundings are filled with wheat, corn, and other grains. Just a few miles south is the University of Nebraska, the largest college in the state and home to a resurgent Cornhuskers football team. When the sun sets on the prairie, you can count on the theaters and venues of the city's North Side to spill jazz and blues into the streets, the rich music developed by the sizeable Black population which calls Omaha their home.\n\nBut just as anvil clouds on the horizon signal incoming thunderstorms, so too does trouble creep towards the city. Rumors of railroad and meatpacking industry restructures threaten a massive wave of layoffs among the impoverished North Side, predominantly targeting Black laborers. While Nebraska has no segregation nor slaver history on the books, the city is governed unofficially by an everpresent policy of redlining and secret covenants keeping the communities apart, only recently even being challenged. Wealth disparity between White and Black citizens is among the highest in the nation. Tensions, always present and always bubbling, threaten to explode as the Civil Rights movement steams on - and, if the Red Summer of 1919 bears any relevance to today, an explosion means riots, lynchings, bloodshed, and death.\n\nOmaha teeters on the precipice of the future - economically as precarious as Detroit or Toledo, racially as fragile as Birmingham or Montgomery. Its fate relies as much upon itself as it does on the nation around it. What way America falls may decide whether Omaha has summer days or tornado season ahead."

Get closer and you can hear the saxophones and organs of jazz and soul sweep in alongside the drums and bass. Once you see the L&C Tower and the sound becomes overpowering, you know you've made it. This is Music City, where the dreams of country's most talented artists come to make their name.\n\nNashville finds its beginnings as a fort built during the Revolutionary War. Its strategic position on the Cumberland River instantly made it a quickly growing investment, both for military and economic purposes, and the city exploded in popularity as more Americans moved over the Appalachians. The Civil War mostly passed the city by, save for the early occupation by Federal forces and the Battle of Nashville in 1864, and that relative intactness allowed the city to prosper in the Reconstruction era and beyond. Healthcare, music, and universities such as Vanderbilt, Belmont, Tennessee State, and others have all become vital to the city's economy and culture, leading to the nickname "The Athens of the South".\n\nThe Athens of the South, however, is plagued by its original sin of slavery. Segregation and discrimination is buried deeply into Nashville's roots. The city itself was founded with slaves to work the streets. The Civil War ended the direct ownership of Black Americans, but Reconstruction brought no racial progress. The Daughters of the Confederacy made their home first in Nashville, and the first incarnation of the Klan found the city as one of its earliest hotbeds. The gruesome lynching of Ephraim Gizzard was only the beginning of the long, arduous, and brutal fight for equality in the city.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement has not left Nashville alone. Recent years have seen some steps forwards in the move towards equality, but the systems of segregation remain in place both officially and unofficially. Tensions smolder under the neon exterior of the clubs and the studios. Still, the people of the city have a lot to look ahead to. The healthcare industry is booming, outside companies are making their new home in the city, and the road for music's best keep leading to Tennessee. At the end of the day, as long as the guitars keep playing and the organs keep sounding their notes, Music City remains hopeful for a brighter future ahead."

 state_lore_desc.210: "In 1847, 14,000 members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, under constant threat both legal and extrajudicial from the Protestant and Catholic majorities of America, made the decision to head west to seek land where they would not be persecuted. In the February cold, they left Nauvoo and trekked into the great unknown, slogging through mud and forced to drag themselves through mountains. It took until July 1847 for the first set of Mormon eyes to fall upon the Salt Lake Valley and the massive body of water beside it, nestled in the heart of the Great Basin - but when Brigham Young saw the view, he knew he had found their new home.\n\nAmerica caught up with the pioneers within the next 3 years, but the Mormons have never left. Through food shortages, harsh weather, armed conflicts, and disease, they staked their claim to their new lands tenaciously. In today's America, Salt Lake City is unique in its status as the largest majority-Mormon city in the country, the headquarters of the LDS church and the site of the gigantic Salt Lake Temple. Religion shows itself in the culture, the universities, the politics, and the people of the region. Few, if any, other cities in America can claim such united worship.\n\nTo focus on nothing more than Mormonism when talking about the Crossroads of the West, however, is to dismiss the culture of almost 200,000 Americans. The beauty of the mountain ranges which make up the edge of the valley is unparalleled, not to mention the strong skiing and hiking scene that comes with them. Beneath their snow-capped exterior, too, are arteries of silver and ore which have made up the bedrock of the region since the 1850's. The city itself, connected by its massive blocks and six-lane streets, has theaters, parks, and a small but vibrant music scene. Finally, of course, there's the eponymous Great Salt Lake, the habitat for millions of birds and scene of trails and tourism.\n\nSalt Lake City has its problems, of course. Growth is stagnating, the city is expected to begin declining in population, and the Church's influence can be as much a hindrance as it can be a help. Yet, despite all this, perhaps Brigham Young's words when he first saw the new home for his Church still apply.\n\n"This is the right place," he said. "Drive on.""

A reason for its growth to the third busiest port in China by the mid-1930s, as well as a major distribution hub for the southeast, was its relative peace; yet, as it stood at the brunt of Japanese artillery fire in 1939, it became anything but.

But the limelight could only favor this inland city for so long before Guangzhou, the coastal jewel, took it back; the fall of the Qing to revolution, the fall of China to Japan, all of it did little to reverse this course.

Founded at the end of the XIX century by Menelik, Emperor of Ethiopia, as the first proper imperial capital, the city grew rapidly with the influx of trade and immigrants from the poorer regions of the burgeoning Empire: the construction of the first railway in an independent African nation further accelerated its development, which only continued under Italian occupation, if for an entirely different purpose.\n\nAs the largest city in the newly-expanded Italian colonial domain, Addis Abeba, soon christened as the "Flower of the Empire" from its colonial coat of arms, was immediately chosen as the seat of the Viceroy, and a large portion of the city was soon demolished to make space for the designs of its new owners. Wide avenues, majestic triumphal arches and modern Italian-style quarters impress an indelible mark upon the city, while the nobility and middle class of the defeated enemy were pushed into ever-expanding slums: there, Italian Blackshirts and native African Policemen make sure that any challenge to the Italian order is quelled with prejudice.\n\nWith more than a million inhabitants, a large industrial sector, and a labyrinthine bureaucracy, Addis Abeba is the largest city in Africa, and the continent's only real metropolis. As such, different rules apply than the rest of the colony: with the impossibility to control the entirety of such a sprawling urban center, the racial order is enforced with way less zeal, and it is not uncommon to see poor Italian colonists live and work side by side with locals, a coexistence unseen in other parts of Italian Africa and which has led to the formation of what many call a unique underground culture."

Sold by the local rulers to Italian traders, it soon became the epicenter of the Italian colonial expansion in Somalia: slowly but steadily, the city expanded as more and more colonists found a new life outside of the mainland, until they outnumbered the natives, and started pushing them towards the outskirts in large slums, rebuilding the city center in the image of a typical Italian town.\n\nWhile less developed than Addis Abeba or Asmara, Mogadiscio is still an important urban center, with more than a hundred thousand inhabitants and several industries - especially in the textile and fruit sectors - marking its progress from a mere trade and agricultural town into a modern industrial city. As Italy's main port into the Indian Ocean, Mogadiscio also boasts a large and modern port: every day, dozens of cargo ships dock here to load Somalia's fruits and textiles, exporting them towards Italy or other countries."

Growing exponentially ever since the end of the XIX century from the influx of Italian colonists, the city has been almost entirely rebuilt by Italian architects: everything, from the gubernatorial palace to the large roads, reflect the influence of Italian - and later, fascist - style, so much that it is commonly nicknamed "the African Rome."\n\nAfter the conquest of Ethiopia, Asmara grew even more as trade routes to and from Addis Abeba passed through the port of Massaua. Boasting a population of almost two hundred thousands, almost two thirds of which Italian, the regional capital of Eritrea is also the second most industrialized city in Italian East Africa after Addis Abeba itself, with several subsidiaries of Italian industries such as FIAT and Ansaldo, as well as an important recruitment center: the Ascari are, in fact, the main pillar upon which the colonial garrison relies upon, and their veterans often receive land and pensions which elevate them far above their brethren.\n\nUnder the shiny façade of a bustling city, however, lies the ugly truth of colonial occupation. Far from the beautiful parks and modern service buildings of the city center, Asmara's outskirts are occupied by slums where tens of thousands of natives live in extremely poor conditions, while unofficial, but deeply entrenched, bureaucratic practices make sure that few, if any native can have a chance to increase their status if not by enlisting in the Ascari: this situation is not only known, but to some extent encouraged by the government in Rome, as the Italianization of the province proceeds."

Around the city center, precision factories for vehicles, precision optics, and medical devices mark Dresden as one of the great industrial centers of Eastern Germany proper - supplying a garrison force that keeps a steady watch on the eastern borders of the Reich."
 
 state_lore_initials.230: "DAN"
 state_lore_name.230: "Danzig"
 state_lore_desc.230: "The first attack of Nazi Germany's war machines was against not a country, but a city made independent by circumstnace after the First World War. Sitting on a namesake bay, Danzig had been separately founded and defined by Polish and German roots. Its Senate overrun by the NSDAP in 1933, the city would begin to infringe upon the rights of its Polish and Jewish inhabitants, and would ultimately be annexed by Germany in the first days of the Second World War. \n\nWith its return affirmed by the passage of decades, the city now stands as a staunchly German city, built around shipbuilding and trade. It looks ahead to the open sea, for behind it lays the countless innocent lives lost through pogroms and genocides in Germania's pursuit for supposed racial superiority."
 
 state_lore_initials.231: "BRS"
 state_lore_name.231: "Breslau"
 state_lore_desc.231: "From the Romans, to the Bohemians, to the Poles, to the Hungarians, to Austrians, and finally to the Prussians, Breslau is a city of many names that has been passed around many nations. The largest city east of Germania, Breslau has long served as an important railway hub to the East and as the industrial center of Silesia.\n\nMany camps, of both the forced labor and extermination type, surround the ancient city. It serves and has served as a stronghold of National Socialism, a bastion of NSDAP support even before they came to power. Millions have been worked to death by the megacorporations all around Breslau, and yet the residents cannot and will not bat an eye.\n\nBreslau, a city known for its long, storied history and multicultural heritage, has been utterly subsumed by the monolith of National Socialism. It is a tombstone for the East, with millions of Slavs and their cultures buried underneath the city."
 
 state_lore_initials.232: "LTZ"
 state_lore_name.232: "Litzmannstadt"
 state_lore_desc.232: "If one glances at Litzmannstadt today, it may appear as an average German city. Its people are German, by a vast majority. Its signs are written in Gothic font, and its walls are plastered with banal nationalist slogans. Even its name comes from a German general, Karl Litzmann, who occupied the region a half-century prior.\n\nBut the facade is thin. Signs of the hundreds of thousands of Poles who lay dead or deported remain etched in the walls, too numerous to ever plaster over completely. Their prayers and accusations remain, preserved and unanswered.\n\nA small number of Poles remain in Litzmannstadt, a class of servants to be abused. They look at the street signs, the banners, the people, and see it is no longer their own. No longer named for its own people, but for the man who conquered them."

 state_lore_name.233: "Hannover"
 state_lore_desc.233: "Hannover - situated at a critical road and river junction in Northern Germany, connecting the maritime cities of the Hanseatic League with overland routes to the Low Countries and the eastern German states - remains a critical center of commerce and intermediate industry in the Reich. Oil, rubber, and chemical factories dot the horizon over a city known for its patronage of intellectual pursuits and higher research - with its past linkages to the German Jewish community and Great Britain consigned to the dustbin of history."
 
 state_lore_initials.234: "KÖN"
 state_lore_name.234: "Königsberg"
 state_lore_desc.234: "The traditional heartland of Prussia, Germany would be almost unrecognisable if it wasn't for the winding spires and paradoxical bridges of Königsberg. During the dark days of Napoleon's rampage across Europe, Königsberg provided a vital shelter for King Frederick William III during the French occupation of Prussia. Just as it served then, and just as it served during the days of the Great Elector, under the Reich, Königsberg serves as the fulcrum that separates Eastern Europe from the Reich's Imperial heartland. \n\nAdorned with statues and monuments to Hitler's savage subjugation of Eastern Europe, there seldom lies a street that does not hold Hitler's visage. Each detail, lovingly crafted by a Party sycophant to portray the Führer as the neo-Alexandrian demigod that forty years of propaganda spent building up.\n\nWhen Hitler dies, he will find he is much more like Alexander than he realises."

 state_lore_desc.235: "[Statelore_Get_tunja_desc]"
 state_lore_desc.235_alive: "Although Jorge Gaitán may be long dead, his dream of a socialist and above all democratic Colombia still lives on in the hearts and minds of Colombians everywhere. Nowhere is this more prominent than in Tunja, the capital of the Colombian Revolutionary Union and the bastion of Gaitán's ideals in Colombia.\n\nThe URC is dedicated to keeping Gaitán's dream alive, declaring avowed support for Gaitán's left-wing activism, fairness and charitability, and his open friendliness towards the United States of America. Naturally, this last tenet has drawn the attention of the OFN, and the URC has received significant support from the aforementioned faction in the form of weapons shipments, olive-green Green Berets, and suit-clad agents in Tunja's government buildings.\n\nShould La Violencia ever resume, the URC has a leg up in terms of a close, friendly superpower, but should the people's reverence for Gaitán and his dream, Tunja's future will be a dark one indeed."
 state_lore_desc.235_dead: "Despite the URC's hard struggle and vicious fight against the reactionary oppressors, Tunja fell, and with it, Gaitán's dream of a genuinely democratic Colombia died. Now, counterrevolutionary forces patrol the streets, cracking the skulls of protestors and rooting out Gaitanista  thought wherever they can find it. The feeling of hope and optimism that once filled the streets has been replaced with a quiet sense of dread and unease, feelings that permeate through the air of Tunja, darkening the clouds of the future.\n\nDespite the URC and Gaitán's legacy seemingly being some of the many sad casualties of La Violencia, they still live, broken and battered as they may be. They live on, deep in the recesses of Tunja and its citizens, quietly awaiting the day where the people can charge forward again for a Colombia that stands free and proud, although that day may not come for a long, long time."

 state_lore_name.236: "Santiago de Cali"
 state_lore_desc.236: "[Statelore_Get_cali_desc]"
 state_lore_desc.236_alive: "Santiago de Cali, better known as Cali, was once a hub of Afro-Colombian culture, and a thriving and bustling metropolitan area in Colombia. Ever since La Violencia, however, the city has practically transformed under the leadership of El Duce, Gilberto Alzate Avedaño. What was once a bright, republican city has become a hive of reactionarism from which the tendrils of Colombian fascism emanate.\n\nCali, under its near-permanent curfew, has become home to flagrant thugs and reactionary brutes. Blackshirts terrorize dissenting families on one street, oligarchs drown themselves in a sea of opulence on another, all while Colombia's most extreme Catholics damn their Jewish enemies to Hell in Cali's Archdiocese just one street over, all causing bloodshed to get the jobs done.\n\nBy becoming the den of hated bands of outlaws, fascists, and mercenaries, and its Afro-Colombian population chased out by terror and persecution, Cali's legacy has been forever tainted, and it is unclear whether the city will recover from eleven years of harsh fascist rule."
 state_lore_desc.236_dead: "After eleven years of the jackboot pressing firmly down on the city's neck, Cali's endless nightmare is finally over. As Avedaño's mercenaries and thugs are driven to the sea or killed, Cali's citizens watch warily through their windows as new soldiers march through the ruined streets, chanting slogans of liberation and change.\n\nDespite no longer being the seat of New Granada, the new Colombia looks at the city warily, and Cali does the same. Eleven years of fascist rule will not go away overnight, and Cali's exhausted people already anticipate the heightened military presence in the city in the name of anti-fascism while damaged buildings and infrastructure go ignored, and Blackshirts and oligarch militias begin to mobilize for insurgency.\n\nAlthough Cali may be free from its sordid past, it remains unknown whether they will ever truly be free from the legacy of Avedaño and his jack-booted thugs."

 state_lore_desc.237: "[Statelore_Get_baq_desc]"
 state_lore_desc.237_hidden: "Barranquilla had long been the home of Colombia's German population, and as of now, also the home of Colombia's German influence. After the massive success of German National Socialism during and after the Second World War, the German Reich has spent a lot of time influencing Germans outside of their borders to accept their ways of thought; in Colombia's tapping into longstanding racism among the criollo aristocracy and convincing them of their true Aryan nature. This has led to rising tensions underneath the surface, as the German Bund and their Colombian allies express increasing disloyalty to the Republic of Colombia.\n\nLurking in the shadows of Barranquilla and the Atlántico department, the Second Patriotic Army watches and waits in silence, like a snake, waiting for the perfect opportunity to reveal themselves to the world and bring Colombia under the influence of National Socialism."
 state_lore_desc.237_reveal: "After eleven years of division, bloodshed, and assassination, La Violencia has resumed, dragging Colombia back into the familiar fires of civil war. However, a new faction has appeared out of the chaos, one that was anticipated by Colombia's current factions: the Second Patriotic Army.\n\nRising from the city of Barranquilla, long the home of German influence in Colombia, the Second Patriotic Army seeks to fulfill the xenophobic dreams of the criollo aristocracy. The SPA fights in the name of National Socialism and Ario-Criollonism, using Barranquilla's Kolumbiendeutscher Volksbund as a springboard to bring all of Colombia under National Socialism.\n\nAlready, German arms and mercenaries have flooded into the city, cementing its status as a German bastion in the New World. It remains to be seen whether Barranquilla and the SPA turn all of Colombia into a National Socialist stronghold or collapse under the pressure of the Colombian Civil War."
 state_lore_desc.237_loss: "Just as the government navy bombarded it eleven years before, Barranquilla burns again. After a hard-fought struggle in the suburbs and the streets, Colombia's Nazi stronghold has been reduced to a smoking ruin, the Kolumbiendeutscher Volksbund's grasp on the city excised once and for all. The Bund is dead, and the German population in Barranquilla has been severely reduced by La Violencia.\n\nIt is unknown what the new Colombian regime has in store for Barranquilla and the Second Patriotic Army remnants that still resist there in the name of an Aryan utopia. Maybe the city will be restored to its Pre-War richness and influence. Maybe Barranquilla will stay a second-rate city, the scars of the civil war never truly going away.\n\nIf there is one thing that is certain for Barranquilla, it's that Germany's hold over the city is dead, but the legacy of the Kolumbiendeutscher Volksbund will be exploited by Colombian national socialists for decades to come."

 state_lore_desc.301: "The lifeblood of Greece can be found not the mountains that dominate its landscape, but in the seas that surround the country and the ships that brave their waves. Trade dominates the Greek economy, even after decades of forced embargoes due to its Italian overlords, and no city encapsulates this element of Greece better than Pátra.\n\nSimilar to most Greek cities, Pátra's history is long and storied, and began thousands of years ago. However, it has long remained an important economic and industrial center due to its central position in the Mediterranean.\n\nDuring the Greek Revolution, Pátra was largely destroyed, and following its rebuilding, stands as both an ancient port and one of the most modern cities in the Balkans, a hillside sentinel overlooking the Gulf of Pátra and the Ionian Sea beyond."
