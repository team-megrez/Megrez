On one hand, most of the settlers didn't actually participate in Norwegian politics or in the atrocities committed, and many of them actually are behind fairly lucrative enterprises that could help us. On the other hand, these people still knew what was happening in Norwegen when they came here, and why the Germans wanted them here, and they were perfectly content with the implication.

The communists expect their voluntary sacrifices to be recognised and rewarded for, and now demand representation in the government-to-be. Many in the bureaucracy -as well as our own ranks- are repulsed by the idea of working with the socialists, and would gladly take any chance to nip the left wing in the bud. On the other hand, at this point it is unsure if we could actually contain the growing socialist influence even if we tried."

Besides, the reds are a persistent lot; kick them out now and they will simply keep lurking about, organising their ranks underground and scheming their eventual takeover- just like they have been doing against the Germans for the last twenty years.\n\nOur only sensible choice right now is to work with the left best we can, not only so they will be appeased enough to let us do our work, but also to keep their activities in check, and attempt to steer them towards the immediate rebuilding of the nation more than our deposition.

Once an unorganised cluster of individuals, Milorg now boasts a large network of dedicated soldiers, each and every one fuelled with a burning hatred for the German and a determination to drag their nation back into democratic degeneracy. Since 1941, this organization has disrupted our supply lines, sabotaged our intelligence and raided our stockpiles.

The reasoning for this is complex, but one of the most significant contributing factors is the status of our border with Sweden. Intelligence and Police forces have confirmed that the Milorg are receiving aid, financial and material, from across the border and show no signs of stopping.

The Milorg, the Norwegian resistance against the Reich's rule, had long been on the fringes of his worries but as of late have grown bolder. Their ties strengthened, there've been reports that they are operating in the cities again in greater force; if they are not rooted out it will be only a matter of time before they try something truly brazen.

Nationalism has surged in the north as finally, the people have gotten their wishes: a Norway for the Norwegians.\n\nHowever, all is not calm and peaceful for the Norwegian people. Rather, the Milorg-led government has had to exhaust all resources on organizing the preparedness for a transparent election. The Norwegians are, in fact, lucky, as they've managed to garner several broad choices for who ought to lead their new democracy: Firstly, Alv Kjøs leading the Høyre, who's been supported by most of the conservative elements of the Milorg for his plan to \"return to tradition\" and favor a strengthening of the Norwegian people in their newfound independence. Next, Gunnar Garbo has led the Venstre into great pockets of both middle-class and upper-class support for his desire to hold economic programs as being the primary focus for getting Norway back on track on the international level.

There, Løfsnes has thumped the reports and argued, with fire and scorn, over the need for a decentralization of the Norwegian government, with its primary focus only for the direct aid of the citizens within, rather than focusing on other matters such as military or trade.\n\nAfter months of preparation, the candidates have prepared their claims.

Next, Gunnar Garbo leads a more central faction within the Norwegian political sphere, as those Norwegians who stand inspired by the greater democracies of the world stand with Garbo and the Venstre. The Venstre seek to expand both upwards and outwards in their attempts to generate growth within the newfound government, and aid Norwegians in being able to claim their power on the world stage via strategic economics and trade. Finally, Einar Gerhardsen has been treading the line against the right-leaning factions of the Milorg to carefully answer the call of the liberal populaces within Norway by creating the Arbeiterpartiet. Within the party, Norwegians call for the centralization of the federal power within the government in order to provide for each and every citizen who may call for needs and wants, to serve the Norwegians which have made the country so great.\n\nTo say that the stability of the recent government has been completely cemented would be an overestimate.

 norway.29.desc: "Norway is a democracy now, and with the upholding of a free and democratic system comes the challenges of accepting the difficulties that come with it. For now, the people of Norway have resorted to mass distress over the continuation of a certain policy which has maintained the guarantees of safety for those which protest it now, one proclaimed via the influence of the Milorg's years of the past. However, one that also served to take away the freedoms of the youth within the free country. One of the most controversial issues of the twentieth century: the Draft.\n\nOn one side, conservative hardliners maintain their wall of support for the drafting program to be upheld, and continuously dig in their heels further to keep the policy intact. Membership within the coalition formulate that the maintenance of a powerful military ensures a guarantee on the freedoms of all Norwegians, and that any threat from the outside world would be equally met by those who sacrifice time and work in the name of national peace, prosperity, and justice. Battle-hardened veterans, fundamentalists of Norwegian culture, strict political militarists within the Storting: all those who had been beaten, bruised, and broken by the Nazi's heel due to the lack of a superior military force to stand up against their oppresors.\n\nOn the other hand, however, the rising representatives of the growing progressive movement within Norway. There, a variety of representatives have come together to stand as defiers to the conservative wall. Rather than continue the forced conscription of the youth into the Norwegian military, the coalition seeks to undo the drafting process for the sake of Norway's economic, political, and societal unity and prosperity. Rather than live in a continuous state of fear, the progressives, made up of economic cliques, student-organizers turned leaders, and labor representatives of the nation seek to move on from the terror that was the Nazi occupation and truly create a positive democracy, one which will allow for the Norwegian people to live as they like.\n\nAs the politicians rage on, the nation has come to a standstill in the schools, businesses, and even city centers. Some within the youth hide in fear of having to go towards a path they were never prepared for; on the other hand, some seek to do their forefathers proud and maintain the shield they built in the military. As the protests and speeches grow louder, a decision must be made."

 norway.30.desc: "The twentieth century brought about a continuous clash between the traditions of old and the next step forward. Every corner of the globe was affected as empires fell, and more grew out of the ashes, while men and women toiled, fought, and died for the guarding of the past battling against the progression to the future. The Second World War proved this, as the question of \"who was a true soldier of their country\" blurred the lines as men and women took up arms against those dreaded invaders, as the male dominance of the military dominated the past, while women continuously proved competent in battle. Now, the question is raised once more in Oslo.\n\nAs the battle lines continue to be drawn, some Norwegians have continuously argued that while the military must be opened further, women \"deserve the pride to serve alongside their fellow countrymen; but, not on the battlefield, the country needs them too much for that,\" as one key representative of the coalition argues. To this end, however, the coalition remains unstable, as despite the great levels of support from some older, more conservative blocs of representation, infighting over the possibility of combat roles or not have torn the group apart from one another. This level of infighting and controversy has ignited rounds of dissatisfaction from within the Storting.\n\nHowever, the opposition has stood resolute against the difficulties of the fundamentalist forces within the legislation. In this, the small coalition representing a variety of women's groups have argued for the full allowance of women into all recognized military positions, including combat positions. Despite the small group of support, the fiery rhetoric and calling upon the female members of the fiery Norwegian resistance leading to the Milorg have allowed for the group within the legislature to continuously grow with a powerful cause backing them.\n\nThus, as Norway once was, the government within the country has become a battle waging over control of the country's direction. Traditionalists and progressives battle in the halls of the government, reminding Norwegians across the country of the battles they had fought to get here, and who to honor for such valiance."

 norway.38.desc: "Major Akselsen, despite the long, medal-adorned, dark green coat he had adorned, still felt the icy breeze of the Norwegian forests pass down his spine as he looked onwards to the soldiers below. For so long, both had fought so hard, battles which the Major frequently recalled as a rising star within the Milorg during its early days, leading ambushes against motorized Nazi convoys passing along the Norwegian-Swedish border during his early days. Sure, although those memories may have earned Akselsen the medals on his coat, they also earned him the scars on his face and the blood on his hands. Yet, at the same time, he knew such memories protected the two countries from the dangers of tyranny so long as the two had citizens left to fight for it; however, the memories did not protect Akselsen from the bootsteps of a superior coming next to him.\n\nAn impressive array of military ribbons donned upon a tall, intimidating figure first caught Akselson's attention, before he realized just who was approaching: a legend, no, the legend, Generalmajor Stig Synnergren. The man who had protected Swedish independence past the exploitation of Scandinavia at the hands of the Wehrmacht, he provoked Akselson to muster the greatest salute he could for the Generalmajor. \"At ease, Major Akselson.\" the General said, before offering Akselson a handshake. Akselson clamored for a response, saying \"Well, you ought to be proud, Major, with the high command has been talking about you, you helped pave the path for all of this, after all.\" Synnergren interrupted. Akselson didn't know how to respond, the high command talking about him? What in the name of God for? \"With all due respect, sir, I'm sure there isn't much need for all of tha-\" \"Major.\" Synnergren interrupted, sternly this time. Akselson felt as if he had made a mistake, as if he had made a grave mistake in front of one of the highest ranked men in Scandinavia. \"Akselson, whether you like it or not, you're a hero to Norway and beyond. You may not have gone out in the forests with a handful of men and a submachine gun in your hands to become known as a hero, but that is what you've done. You're a soldier, Akselson, a soldier, an officer, and a symbol for people across the world, all of those who remain in chains because of those bastards in the Reich. Be proud.\"\n\nThe Generalmajor turned with the Major to look onwards as various infantry regiments and tank divisions marched off to the forest for training."

 norway.39.desc: "The constant talk of management and organization of Operation Fortwall had bored the Swedish Generalmajor as he walked forwards, with the sight of veteran Norwegian and Swedish infantry units marching out into the forests, and the babbling of subordinates giving organizational reports behind him. It may have been his assignment to carry out for the next few weeks of joint military exercises, but a man could not deny the clawings of boredom as they grew, could he? That was, until Generalmajor Synnergren was stopped in his tracks at the appearance of an unsuspecting officer: a shining youth of the Norwegian Army, bearing as many medals above his breast pocket as there were scars upon his face, with a name that ran true legend through the words of the General Staff of both nations: Major Tor Akselson, a hero of the Norwegian resistance. The Generalmajor had to regain his composure as he approached the quickly rising young soldier.\n\nHis quiet bootsteps forward had not delayed the Major's quick, even rushed salute. Though honored, Synnergren felt more honor in being able to meet the rising pupil within the Norwegian ranks, and now, a comrade in arms. \"At ease, Major Akselson.\" The Generalmajor said sternly, despite offering a handshake for the Major. With Synnergren noticing the Major seemed nervous, like a child getting caught by a parent, the Generalmajor said \"Well, you ought to be proud, Major, with the high command has been talking about you, you helped pave the path for all of this, after all.\" \"With all due respect, sir, I'm sure there isn't much need for all of tha-\"\n\nGoddamnit. This kid's a hero, not some washed up recruit hotshot, the Generalmajor thought. \"Major.\" Synnergren finally said, stopping the man in his tracks. \"Akselson, whether you like it or not, you're a hero to Norway and beyond. You may not have gone out in the forests with a handful of men and a submachine gun in your hands to become known as a hero, but that is what you've done. You're a soldier, Akselson, a soldier, an officer, and a symbol for people across the world, all of those who remain in chains because of those bastards in the Reich. Be proud.\"\n\nSynnergren had only hoped that he had prepared a good enough speech for the man to gain some confidence in himself, as he saw that the bright man, rising swiftly through the ranks as he had been, stared forward, contemplatively. \"Thank you, sir. I, well, very much appreciate it, sir.\" Major Akselson said."

Glimpses of daily life flashed past like images on a film reel. He saw a mother with her child. A woman walking her dog. A citizen marching down the street with a stiff gait and a high chin. A military man.\n\nOlav smiled. He himself had served as a general in the Second World War. So desperately had he wanted to remain with his fellow Norwegians as the Nazis pushed onwards, but his father would not have it. He would be more useful in exile, he was told, but what use was a fleeing man? What use was he when the Germans stormed England? As snowy Canada drew nearer, so did the fire within him rage harder.\n\nThe horror of the 1940s felt like another lifetime. As much as he had loathed his exile, nothing in the world would make him regret the safety and comfort it brought his family. Olav's father had lost the spark in his eyes, but his children had gained theirs. Through it all was Märtha. Beloved Märtha. A soft touch in days of weakness, a soothing voice in nights of anger and tears. Not once did she lose her smile, even as the cancer slowly stole her away. His father had died just three years later. Never again were they to feel Norwegian snow upon their faces.\n\nThe People's King, they called him. Apparently. What did Olav's speeches and meetings really mean, in the safety of his Canadian residence? The common people sacrificed their lives, their families, their spirits for Norway... and yet he was the symbol of resistance? The images outside the window had changed. Crowds of people were screaming in the streets, holding signs and chanting. The car came to a stop. The door opened. Olav took a deep breath and exited.\n\nCheering. It hit him like a crushing wave, nearly knocking the strength from his legs. He floated towards Nidaros Cathedral, and the cameras watched eagerly as he seated himself on the throne. The coronation felt like a dream. A heavy crown was placed upon his head, and with it came the weight of the whole nation. He knew his words were to be broadcast in every household throughout the country.\n\n\"I am home,\" King Olav said with a steely gaze, even as his eyes watered. \"I am home, and the people of Norway will never suffer again.

A symbol of hope, and an old metal pin.\n\nHe looked back to his two compatriots. They pushed and pulled their oars silently, the dark of night enveloping their Waffen-SS uniforms. He owed Arne and Thor his life, and they trusted him with theirs. The operation was likely a trap, but it hadn't stopped the trio from setting out to sea in the dead of night.

For the first, and probably only time in his life, Jakob thanked God that he was wearing an SS uniform. Even if they were spotted in the shadows, they could simply claim to be new Waffen recruits.\n\nThe Villa Grande, the corpse-white building at the center of the property, lit the night between the trees with its glowing windows. He led Thor and Arne around the Stone Garden and towards its secret passageway, exactly as the map had detailed. Slicing through the ground was a narrow concrete entrance ending at a small door. It was unprotected. Jakob instinctively looked around him. No approaching footsteps. No chatter. No rustling. Just silence. The trio crept forwards.

Up and up they went, their boots gently pressing against every step. At last they reached the top floor, where a long stretch of corridor awaited them. If his memory served correctly these were the servants' bedrooms. He inched forwards, barely breathing. The trio were uniformed, yes, but would that be enough? Time seemed to slow down as he reached the end of the corridor and pushed open the door, releasing a shaky breath.\n\nJakob surveyed the kitchen - and instantly locked eyes with a small blond man. His breathing stopped. The man froze, eyes wide in surprise, hands motionless inside his large ball of dough. Thor and Arne suddenly pushed past Jakob and strode towards the exit on the far side of the kitchen, their chests puffed up in feigned arrogance. Jakob followed their lead, glaring at the cook with intensity. A look of dread spread across the man's deathly pale face and he averted his gaze, continuing to knead.

Not Vidkun Quisling. He had been tossed aside like a puppet without strings, destined to lay motionless in his mansion for the rest of days. Oh, how certain he had been of his future. He remembered the chilly winds whipping at his face as he distributed food aid for the famished peasants of Russia; with the evils of Bolshevism bared before him, he swore to protect his nation from the same fate... only to open the gates to the German thugs, who taunted him with promises of power while stomping on the face of Norway.\n\nParanoia had gripped him for many years. Resistance movements, schemers within Nasjonal Samling, the Germans themselves - every day he feared the cold embrace of death would seize him or his wife, Maria. Over time, the grizzled old loyalists in the Førergarde were being replaced by those dead-eyed Waffen-SS youngsters 'gifted' by the administration.

The Villa Grande was just as grandiose on the inside as it had been on the outside. Jakob remembered a phrase his mother had once told him and smiled. 'It is the most beautiful places that house the ugliest beasts'. At the end of the Hall, the library door awaited them, bright light streaming out from underneath.

 POLITICS_KNUT_MOYEN_DESC: "Knut Møyen has held a dream for many years now- the liberation of his home nation, Norway. His dream has been achieved. He never really held the aspiration of leading this new Norway- in his own words, he's only a businessman- but it seems that the situation has called for him to take the mantle as well. Now, Knut Møyen has the unenviable task of preparing Norway for its transition to a true democracy, and in the eyes of his many supporters, there's nobody better for the job.\n\nBorn in 1907, Knut was only an athlete and a businessman before the Germans came and tore down everything he loved. In such a terrible situation, Knut did what every brave son of Norway did and joined the resistance, choosing the Milorg in particular. Within a year, Møyen rose through the ranks of the resistance, becoming the head of Milorg. Under his rule, Milorg's activities crippled and hindered German movements across all of Norway, turning much of the nation into a no-go zone for the Heer and swelling Milorg's numbers to 20,000 strong in his tenure as its head.\n\nUnfortunately, Møyen would be forced to escape to Sweden by a Gestapo raid, leaving for London soon afterwards. When England fell to the German invaders, he fled to Scotland. Finally, he made his perilous return to his home, retaking the reigns of command from his subordinates. It is of the opinion of most Norwegians that Møyen's leadership is the main reason as to how the Milorg remained active in the decades since the war ended. However, even with his leadership, it was the opinion of many that Milorg, and the resistance in general, was reaching its last legs by the early 60's, with slowly shrinking numbers and an increasingly apathetic population.\n\nThat is, until Germany collapsed in on itself in a spectacular implosion, and Terboven and his men left for home. In the chaos that followed, Møyen and Milorg swept into Oslo, throwing out the weak collaborators that remained and proclaiming a new Norway, free of German influence. Now, Møyen's focus switches to reversing the laws and regulations the Germans dared to impose on Norway, reinstituting the Kingdom, and returning the nation to what it was before the war. Once this is finished, Møyen will take his leave, having left his mark as a hero to all Norway."
 POLITICS_PER_BORTEN_DESC: "In the chaos of Terboven's departure from Norwegen, the NS tore itself to shreds fighting over who would gain power. Radicals, moderates, and reformists turned the streets of Oslo into a chaotic battleground as the resistance massed in the mountains. For a time, there was no faction in the NS who seemed posed to win, and a resistance takeover seemed inevitable. Finally, a miracle- the reformists, led by Per Borten, seized the reigns of the government just in time to repulse the resistance, saving the collaborationist regime.\n\nBorten was born in 1913 as the son of a farming family. His rise through the political establishment was considered unexpected, due to his moderate views on many issues that the German government pushed heavily on. However, his relative popularity took him from simply a mayor to the leader of the reformist wing of the NS, where he unsuccessfully advocated for numerous governmental and social reforms. Finally, Borten's 20 year political journey has reached its end, with him seizing power over all of Norway.\n\nThough Borten could be considered a liberal in comparison to his counterparts, he is not a full-blown reformist. Many of his proposed changes to Norway only go so far, stopping whenever they reach the prickly issue of the NS's constitutionally-mandated stranglehold on the Storting. In effect, Borten still runs a dictatorship- a more accepting, less autocratic dictatorship, but a dictatorship. Another major change is his usage of Norwegian nationalism in his doctrine, advocating for independence from Germany- however, some question whether Borten will hold that policy when push comes to shove.\n\nIn the end, Borten certainly has a lot of bark. What remains to be seen is how much of that bark is backed by his bite."
 POLITICS_GULBRAND_LUNDE_DESC: "When Terboven and his men abandoned Norway, heading back to their rapidly disintegrating homeland, the civilian government quickly disintegrated with them. Cliques of reformists, hardliners, and moderates splintered from the corpse of the National Assembly and spread over Oslo, sewing chaos and confusion across Norway. In the end, order prevailed, and the mainstream finally steadied the ship of state. At their head? One of the longest-lasting, most tenured members of the NS- Gulbrand Lunde.\n\nLunde was once simply a chemist, specializing in biochemistry. However, his scientific pursuits would be placed on hold in favor of Vidkun Quisling and his party, the National Assembly. One of its earliest members, Lunde proved himself a capable, loyal, hardworking administrator. This loyalty would boost Lunde to the ministries of Norwegian politics when the NS finally took power. Throughout this time, Lunde frequently attracted the ire of the German garrison for his nationalist views, as he tried to distance what he called the Norse people from the rest of the Germans. Indeed, it is widely theorized that the Germans kept Lunde from the highest posts of the civilian government because of his views on race. However, with no Germans around to stop him, Lunde finally has the control he's worked so hard for.\n\nLunde's policy does not emphasize much in the way of change for Norway. While he has a few policies planned, such as the end of Germanization, it's no secret that Lunde would not mind re-entering the Pakt as a collaborator state. For much of Norway, it almost seems like Terboven never even left."
 POLITICS_JONAS_LIE_DESC: "Ask any man, woman, or child in Norway about their thoughts on Jonas Lie, and one will receive a ridiculously varied number of responses. To the radical collaborators, Lie is a hero, the only man in Norway who works for their interests. To the moderates, Lie is dangerous, a friend of Himmler who wishes to replace the idea of Norway with a bastardized, German version. To the resistance, Lie is a disgusting pig, a cowardly traitor who bends over backwards to lick the soles of the German boot stomping on Norway. However, there's one fact about Lie that is undeniably true- he holds the reigns of Norway with a firm grip.\n\nBorn to the famed author, Jonas Lie Sr., Lie was one of the top police authorities in Norway, as well as a popular author himself. His writing experience would serve him well, allowing him to write numerous political papers. However, once captured by the Germans, Lie's views significantly shifted into a pro-German stance, correctly betting that Germany would eventually win the war. From there, he would serve in the German Army, founding the Norwegian SS and serving as a high member of the NS. When the war eventually concluded, Lie returned to Norway as a rabid pro-German politician, assuming the role of Police Minister. From there, he bided his time, waiting for his moment to shape Norway as he sees fit. With Terboven gone, Lie seized the opportunity and overpowered his opponents, taking full command of Norway.\n\nNow, Lie has control over all of Norway, and the nation trembles at the thought. Indeed, it seems that Lie believes that Germany is not gone for good, but only temporarily indisposed, and he is hell-bent on keeping everything, including Germanization, in order for their inevitable return. Though he may be unpopular, it seems to most that Lie is too powerful to overcome.\n\nFor Lie, Norway's future is bright, tinged with the crimson of Nazism. For most everyone else, the future seems bleaker than it's ever been."
 POLITICS_EINAR_GERHARDSEN_DESC: "After decades of oppression under the Nazi boot, democracy has finally returned to Norway. Møyen has departed from the top office gracefully and smoothly, and it's said by many that the man replacing him could not be a better fit for the new Norway. If Møyen was the father of the post-German Norway, than Einar Gerhardsen is certainly the ideal son.\n\nEinar Gerhardsen was born in 1897, spending his early years bouncing from profession to profession before finally joining the Labor Party, becoming a top party official all the way up to the German invasion. The war years would not be kind to Gerhardsen, as he lost his positions, was captured after he joined the resistance, and remained in prison for the next 9 years. When he was released, he would soon rejoin the resistance, working with Møyen to rally the general population through propaganda and resistance newspapers. This work would lead to great reward, with Gerhardsen riding next to Møyen in the victory parade after the Milorg takeover. With his Labor Party relegalized, Gerhardsen would quickly retake the mantle of the Party, leading it to a great electoral victory and becoming Norway's new Prime Minister.\n\nGerhardsen's policies in office are ambitious, western, and not too dissimilar from neighboring Sweden. Progressive taxes, social security, industrialization- all are major domestic goals for the new Labor platform. Unsurprisingly, Gerhardsen's foreign policy is heavily pro-OFN, as he seeks to expand ties with the west to protect the Kingdom from the German eagle.\n\nWith Gerhardsen in charge, Norway takes its first full steps forward into a new era- one not of fear and subservience, but one of progress and freedom."
 POLITICS_GUNNAR_GARBO_DESC: "Gunnar Garbo is a walking puzzle. His policies and positions have stumped many analysts. He claims to be a centrist, moderate choice for Norway, yet holds more socially progressive positions than his other moderate contenders. He represents the Left, a liberal party, but decries what he calls an \"excess of economic liberalism\". It's a common joke that he looks more to the left than he does to the Left, his own party. However, these questions have captured the interest of the public, as now Garbo takes the reigns of a new Norway.\n\nBorn in 1924, Garbo was only a teen when the Nazi's landed on Norway's shores. He joined his father as an active resistance journalist. His father would lose his head for his work, and Garbo was forced to flee to Sweden for a period of time before returning to Milorg during the 50's. From there, he made his way up through the Left's apparatus, finally taking the chairman's position as Milorg marched on Oslo. After a fierce electoral competition, Garbo reached the top of the mountain, becoming Prime Minister.\n\nGarbo's policies are an eclectic mix of social progressivism and restrained economic liberalism. His policies also have taken a surprisingly environmental turn, with multiple movements to protect Norway's natural beauty. Many of his economic policies are mixes of the regulations of the Social Democrats and the free market economics of the Conservatives. Overall, Garbo's policies are confusing, exciting, and highly experimental.\n\nGarbo is many things, but as long as he stays around in Norway's politics, there will always be one thing that all can be sure of- he's a very interesting man."
 POLITICS_ALV_KJOS_DESC: "The first election in the new Norway's history was expected to mainly be a contest between the center-left factions in Norwegian politics, with the Conservative party only expected to play as spoiler. However, the polls clearly underestimated the charisma of Alv Kjøs, the man who took the Conservatives from disaster to victory, the man who now takes over from Møyen as leader of Norway.\n\nKjøs was born into a farming family, but quickly set his sights on a military career. His decision seemed destined to bear fruit, as he was promoted to major by 1940, but all plans would be thrown aside when the Germans landed on Norwegian shores. Kjøs was captured early on, and could only watch helplessly from behind the barbed wire as his beloved nation was crushed beneath the Nazi boot. When the war came to an end, and POWs were finally released, Kjøs quickly joined the resistance, fighting tirelessly for Norway's freedom. As with his military career, so did his tenure with the resistance bear fruit, as he rode triumphantly into Oslo alongside his counterparts. Finally, as he entered politics on the side of the Right, his message of economic liberalism, state protestantism, and industrialization caught fire with the Norwegian people, who elected him to their highest office.\n\nKjøs now gets to work on fulfilling his promises. Already, curious businesses sniff the air in Norway for new opportunities, and factories already lay their foundations from Oslo to Narvik. The religious right celebrates the return of Protestantism as a state religion. Questions still surround Kos on whether he can keep the momentum of the Right going, or how well his new Norway will actually do, but for now, all of Norway can sleep soundly knowing that a steady hand controls the ship of state."
 POLITICS_KNUT_LOFSNES_DESC: "Knut Løfsnes should not be where he is today. He was not a member of Milorg, or any of its affiliates. His political positions, in the eyes of almost all analysts, were well to the left of what even a nation like Norway would accept. His base consisted solely of students and communists. To any reasonable person, Løfsnes stood no chance against the other titans he was running against.\n\nAnd yet, Løfsnes has won.\n\nA teacher before the war, Løfsnes joined the resistance quickly. He was captured, released, and fled to Sweden before anything else could happen to him. Once in Stockholm, Løfsnes would work with the XU unit, feeding information to the Allies, even when all hope of victory was lost. Finally, with the war over, Løfsnes returned to Norway to continue the fight. He would participate in the march on Oslo, though nowhere near the front of the parade, and set up his own Socialist People's Party to run in the upcoming election. Despite the odds being stacked so heavily against him, the Socialists would pull out a victory in the final election, stunning Norway.\n\nLøfsnes's policies have brought much speculation onto the future of Norway. Unlike any other candidate, Løfsnes has demonstrated a reluctance to join with the OFN, instead preferring a neutral approach that some may fear is impossible.\n\nHowever, the most worrying- or, in his supporter's eyes, appealing- aspect of Løfsnes's positions is his total refusal to even consider a deal with the Germans. For some, this shows Løfsnes's dedication to keeping Norway free. For others, it spells the certain doom of the restored Kingdom. Norway's future, as much as it is speculated about, rests on shaky ground. Can it survive the German century?"
 POLITICS_HENRIK_ROGSTAD_DESC: "Unlike his many Nasjonal Samling comrades harbouring secret resentment towards the Reich, Henrik Rogstad is a proud Pan-Germanist through and through. Determination and loyalty saw this former leader of the NS youth movement rise through the Norwegian political scene until he settled into a modest administrative position under Josef Terboven, a platform he used to openly endorse the radical wing of his Party. With the bureaucratic skills accumulated throughout his political life and the strict discipline drilled into him by his service in the Hirden, Rogstad harshly reigns as the new Fører of Norway.\n\nSince the dismantlement of Terboven's administration, Rogstad's fervent dedication to the German Reich has only strengthened, leading to an infamous reputation among Norwegians all across the political spectrum - and even within his own Party. The Fører's cohorts praise him as the only man strong enough to haul Norway back into greatness, while his opponents decry him as little more than a tinpot dictator dancing on German strings to the tune of the Führer's demands."
