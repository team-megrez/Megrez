Here it is merely hideously expensive, not to mention unconstitutional. Cutting funding for most of them will both solve part of our financial woes and uphold the law of the land at the same time."

Learned men would realize the natural consequence of such a foolish action; as token comfort, such learned men now take charge in restoring much-needed order to America's balance sheets.\n\nThe solution they offer is beautiful in its crude simplicity; cut both bureaucracy and budget by a certain percentage, and either will help the other shrink to more manageable levels."

Still not an ideal condition, by any means, but at least it now loses considerably less money than before the election. Now all that remains of Johnson's legacy are the programs which do enjoy the people's approval to some extent, Social Security the most notable among them.\n\nCongress is divided on how to proceed at this juncture; fiscal conservatives, in addition to our voter base, advocate dismantling these programs posthaste. Contrariwise, moderates from Johnson's own party argue that the benefits of keeping them around outweigh both their association to his name and the cost of their upkeep. For all its faults, they argue, the Great Society has a smattering of both well-intentioned and effective solutions for some of America's faults.\n\nWhich path shall we pursue?"

Despite the money he had wasted as kids do with their lunch money on a candy store, the ex-President did manage to fund programs which have guaranteeably improved the American people's lot. Keeping them around ensures that the nation will continue eating the better morsels of Johnson's cake.\n\nAdditionally, Democrats will be less likely to throw a tantrum for taking away even more of the handouts they so irresponsibly promised.

If we're to save some of his programs, then which to fund and how much to spend must be carefully considered. The budget hawks in Congress can only stomach so many exemptions before denouncing us for being too lenient on his disastrous budget -- and justifiably so.\n\nHence, the new budget's discretionary funds shall be earmarked only to those initiatives which have demonstrated overwhelming success, or at least a large benefit-cost ratio, in their intentions."

Questions over moral responsibility and constitutionality aside, America cannot feasibly subsidize all of its citizens' lives from cradle to grave; to demand for such an impossibility is the height of naiveté, and listening to such voices will bring about the very failures that had sunk Johnson's presidency.\n\nOur country's safety net must be futureproofed from the temptation to further deprive funds from it for the sake of a balanced budget.

As his final days in the White House has proven, large government brought only reckless spending to the American economy and pitiful gains for the American people. So do we approach the state of affairs after he left his office in disgrace: Decades of sure progress undone in four short years after unwavering obedience to one small lie.\n\nWe have acquired the consent of the governed only by promising to learn from the man's follies. Future administrations may ignore their heeding; for now, however, the venerable word of State and Congress trump the fickle whims of rabble-rousing Presidents."

 USA_LBJReac_End_Social_Security_desc:0 "It is safe to say that Johnson's legacy has now been fully undone. His programs have been repealed and the national budget freed from their burdensome expense. What remains of his Great Society has either been relegated to the history books or gutted so thoroughly that they fail to act even as cushy sinecures to gift to allies. Though time is needed so the fruits of sane spending can blossom, the government's money is no longer under threat from those that jeopardize its recovery from here on...\n\n...Except, a clique of conservatives say, for the Social Security Program. Johnson's crown jewel may be popular with the American people, but the fact remains that its foundations are shaky at best, and a fraud scheme at worst. There will inevitably arrive a time where the stream of young working men on whom Social Security relies can no longer keep pace with its dependents. A system of handouts with such a blatant point of failure has no place in a penny-wise economy; hence, they proclaim, Social Security must go."
 USA_LBJReac_Rocked_Boat:0 "흔들려진 배를 진정시키기"
 USA_LBJReac_Rocked_Boat_desc:0 "Johnson had campaigned for a massive wave of civil rights legislation leading up to Election Day, without regard for the recklessness of promising too much within too short a time. Perhaps he genuinely thought radical action was necessary to heal the country's racial divides, or perhaps he saw it as a risky gamble to rally the Black Belt behind him and nothing more.\n\nIn any case, he ultimately failed in both accounts; Southern whites cried foul for doing too much to improve the black man's fortunes, and blacks nationwide expectedly felt betrayed that the President would pay so little of what he owed. In attempting to bind the nation's wounds, the Texan widened its gashes instead.\n\nThe situation as it stands can be compared to a rocket boat on a full-speed collision course with a rocky cliff. Our mandate demands that we rein it in before the nation crashes headlong into another avoidable crisis."

As Senatorial gladiator fights are farthest from our agenda, we should at least make a show of treating his jeremiads with the consideration he expects. Lord knows how insufferable the Alabaman grandstander can be in the middle of his polemics..."

 USA_LBJReac_Unshackle_Police_desc:0 "In an attempt to prevent America's police forces from handing injustice to Afro-Americans, the Civil Rights Act's drafters had wrapped our officers with enough red tape to keep them from handing anything at all. What use are policemen so emburdened with onerous policies that they are effectively unable to enforce the law? Security theater of this sort does no one justice -- neither the blacks it claims to protect, nor the brave men who did swear an oath to protect them.\n\nIf we expect our cops to serve and protect, then freeing our police services from the fell clutches of such intrusive bureaucracy is a sine qua non. Any less remains a hindrance they are better served without."

But trimming can only do so much to an issue that weighs a metric ton in the public discourse. It remains there by the corner whether we like it or not, waiting patiently for the final decision.\n\nWhat this final decision should be, as always, has one of two answers: Either back the CRA as it stands to the hilt, or consign it to the Congressional archives as failed legislation. Good Presidents exercise prudence at critical junctures in their term -- like this"

On the contrary, vast swathes of the American people would consider it an attestation of the jubilee they were promised. Its protections for them and theirs are miles beyond what they've had years prior; shunting these already-enforced legal defenses to placate the South's whites invite more trouble than it's worth.\n\nLeaving aside the good maintaining the Act's serviceable parts can do for America's racial divides, the fact of the matter is that the CRA is already in force. To circumvent the headaches that come with striking down a popular law in a blatant political attack, we should accept the Act as the binding law that it is."

 USA_LBJReac_Enforce_the_Provisions_desc:0 "Dura lex, sed lex -- the law is harsh, but it is the law. One cannot underestimate the import of this facet of the social contract in maintaining civilization; without the will to obey even undesirable laws, then societies will collapse out of enmity for legal codes which do not agree with everyone's preferences to the letter. Likewise, governments must show a willingness to uphold its own laws without prejudice for the same reasons.\n\nThis applies fittingly well to our own circumstances with the Civil Rights Act. Though we have our disagreements with some of its portions, it still stands uncontested as an integral part of American jurisprudence. We are thus obliged to enforce its decrees -- if not their spirit, then at least their letters."

 USA_LBJReac_Dismiss_Lawsuits_desc:0 "Lawsuits are time-honored weapons with a special place in the American man's armory. Where the knights and kings of old joust for the privilege to be seen as just, Americans instead invoke the court of law to outlast the other's money. Nevermind that your reasoning is invalid at best; so long as there are means, then one will have their long, not-so-speedy case under common law. Justice has been miscarried in such a manner many times before.\n\nIncidentally, an increasing number of lawsuits aimed at certain portions of the CRA have been recorded since Johnson's ratification thereof. If left unaddressed, these lawsuits may effectively repeal parcels of the CRA until it is de facto repealed completely. Fortunately, the Supreme Court's current Justices know better than to ignore and abet these naked attacks -- acquiring their direct assistance may end these lawsuits for good."

Principles have been sacrificed and bargains were dealt to get us to where we are now.\n\nUpholding our end of the deal at this point in time may not be the easy thing to do... but it damn well is the right thing to do. Hence, we shall get rid of the Civil Rights Act by any means necessary."

By determining which laws are enforced and which aren't, even laymen can figure out their own government's priorities without an overt declaration.\n\nWe can use this logic to signal to Congress and our base that the Civil Rights Act is no longer appreciated by our administration. Controversy must be avoided as much as possible; this approach mitigates the risk of such occurring by allowing us some degree of plausible deniability for those unaware or unwilling to read into our actions' implications."
 USA_LBJReac_Quiet_Gutting:0 "조용하게 파괴하기"
 USA_LBJReac_Quiet_Gutting_desc:0 "Dedicated we may be to repealing the Civil Rights Act, but we are not blind to the repercussions it may cause. America's black population, and their allies in Congress and state governments, will riot like nothing else if we so much as hint of a repeal. As official processes are all but barred under pain of political suicide, creative means to negate its repressive decrees have been considered.\n\nOne proposed option is to introduce seemingly separate laws and Executive Orders in the coming months, each repealing a small portion of the CRA. This would continue under the guise of the customary spree of legislation enacted in a newly-elected incumbent's first hundred days; by the time people realize what has happened, the Act's de facto repeal will be a fait accompli."
 USA_LBJReac_Back_on_Track:0 "정상 궤도로 돌아오다"
 USA_LBJReac_Back_on_Track_desc:0 "Years from now, history books will cover in detail Lyndon Johnson's meteoric rise and meteoritic fall from grace in American politics. They will talk of his accomplishments and failings. They will dissect and analyze his minute movements, foibles and mannerisms to understand his motivations, his drives and acts. They will hound his life for the happenings he had seen and the places he had been, to piece together and make sense of a timeline with a beginning and end; rising and falling actions; and tension and denouement. And they will still conclude that the good Senator from Texas had presided over a dismal Presidency whose crowning achievement is pushing the national debt to record highs.\n\nWhoever writes our story will see a contrast more striking than light and dark. Where Johnson had a death spiral for a budget, ours is a thunderbolt striking upwards. Where Johnson had a country torn in two colors, ours is one nation mended whole by the stitches of brotherhood and reconciliation. Where Johnson had left America approaching twilight, we continue guiding it towards rolling plains forever bathed in sunrise.\n\nIn time, history might redeem Lyndon Baines Johnson for his many failings. But by then America will have long known that [USA.GetLeader] had pulled her out of those failings and set her back into right and proper straits once more."

He went on to explain that, after meeting with the President, he has determined that the nation has more pressing concerns at this time, and that he must stop obstructing the day-to-day functions of Congress for his own political desires.\n\nThe rest of his Southern voting group have seen their leader's surrender and the reaction has been somewhat mixed. Many Southern politicians are outraged, claiming that Russell was bribed or otherwise coerced into giving up. Others have followed suit with Senator Russell, reserving their opinions on Civil Rights for another time. Regardless, the anti-Civil Rights movement has been effectively beheaded in Congress, and it appears that Congress will be able to function as normal from here on out."

Alone he stood against both the duplicitous Republican-Democrats and the fanciful dreams of his new party's progressives and communists. His cause was one of succor in a tempest, a guiding light promising comfort and vigor renewed to a rain-soaked, fatigued man. With America's greatest generations behind him, Wallace paraded down the National Mall in his inauguration like Augustus leading a triumph in the streets of Rome: flush with victory, praised by men, and all but assured that the Republic will be restored under his rule.\n\nThe hindsight of having followed a lunatic to his downfall tastes like bitter, dry ash to many Americans' weary tongues. Grief and shame will follow them as companions for a good while yet.\n\nIn the meantime, President [Root.GetLeader] swears the oath of office under cloudy skies and scattered rainshowers. [Root.GetHerHis] supporters came out in droves despite the weather, clinging to [Root.GetHerHis] uplifting words as rain-soaked, fatigued men cling to what embers burn in defiance of drizzle and damp cold. In every one of them can be found the irony of the forsaken, having their trust betrayed by one man promising them the world, bestow that very same trust to another claiming the very same. Perhaps they do recognize it, yet bestow their trust regardless in a fit of desperation -- so horrified are they of Wallace that they would risk another mistake for a chance, any chance, to undo the nightmare he had wrought.\n\nThe weight of duty bears heavy on the shoulders of every American President since George Washington. Yet in the midst of the nation's greatest crisis in decades, President [Root.GetLeader], it seems, shall bear heavier weights than most. For the American people, [Root.GetSheHe] must."

Still, our party's leading figures questioned the wisdom of rocking the American boat overtly while we all suffered under Wallace's idiocy; one innocuous overture, they cautioned, may lose us the trust and votes we dearly needed to keep the party whole. Pandering for votes can come after the fragments of government are picked up and good governance made whole.\n\nTo their credit the strategy worked -- at least, until Wallace was booted from office. Now the crisis has passed, and its bandaids have lost their hold over the deep fissures they had papered. Both left and right have mobilized their machines and their men, lumbering to life to again fight their respective sides in America's many issues. Now there is nothing the White House can do but to either rein what it can control... or tie its fortunes to either side.\n\nNormalcy may be returning to America, but in a fit of myopia, its people have forgotten what \"normal\" truly meant -- not an end to chaos, no, but rather its resumption after a century of pause."

Passionate souls engage in riotous behavior to prove their point, and policemen intervene to uphold the law's points.

Old hands learn to use money where it counts. Still, it pained the Arizonan to burn some hundred thousands of dollars to ease cornered rats, like Barry's companion. The man's bloodshot eyes locked with his while their owner quaffed his drink like a man gasping for water.\n\n\"Wallace had some catastrophically bad ideas,\" he began, pausing for the right words. \"But also some good ones hiding underneath. Ideas which we both value equally.\"\n\n\"And you don't trust the Ivy Leaguers and liberals you hitched with no more.\" His Southern twang rolled thick with tar, spite and beer foam.\n\nBarry sighed. \"Look, I know we didn't leave on the best of terms-\"\n\nA snort.\n\n\"-but there's no chance in Hell they'll go along with us here. You might.\" He shook his head. Any man his place would be just as tempted to finish the job. \"No. You will.\"\n\nThe President returned his erstwhile colleague's stare with his own. \"Right?\"\n\nSmothered by silverware, conversation and jazz chords, their own silence stretched out unnoticed. What hesitation lingered in Barry's conscience faded as he held his ground against the spiteful, beleaguered exile.\n\nThen the erstwhile Republican's lower broke into a grin, sputtering chuckles like an engine thrumming to life. He poured a bottle of beer on both his and an unused mug until amber liquid filled both to three-fourths their height.\n\n\"If Philadelphia had more folk like you then me and mine wouldn't have jumped ship someplace greener!\" the Congressman laughed out.\n\nBarry caught the mug slid his way as he let his breath loose. If not brought back to the fold, then they were at least now willing to vote with the party. Having their golden mouthpiece pledge his cooperation will see to that soon enough.\n\nThe Senator raised his mug towards the night sky. \"To the union,\" he toasted, \"next to our liberty, the most dear.\"\n\nBarry Goldwater chuckled.

News does travel fast in D.C.; rumors can entangle themselves in an intricate web of connections, helpless before press journalists looking for a scoop. Setting his fountain pen to its holder, the Arizonan tilted up and faced the New Yorker fully.\n\n\"I promised the American people to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution,\" he answered, just like last... several conversations they've had as of late. \"Now you ask me to play tyrant with its laws just because we're staying in the White House for four years?\"\n\n\"For the love of God, Barry, we've been through this before-\"\n\n\"And my opinion hasn't changed: It's not our job. Treat the states like children once and they'll act like children 'til the day we die.\"\n\n\"So all the blacks out dying in Montgomery and Savannah are just kids' toys to you?!\" Rockefeller bursted out, looking for all the world like a red-faced devil as he did. His pointed fingers accused the President of some grand crime only his Vice knew. \"Is that your promise, Goldwater? Letting them suffer more in the hands of spoiled brats before we give them what they're owed?\"\n\nBarry said nothing as he matched Rockefeller's glare. Silent moments later the man deflated, breaking contact.\n\n\"Don't block it. Do anything else you want -- just promise us that.\" He trailed off. The unspoken threat hung in the humid night air like a guillotine. Barry's head or Rockefellers... it was pointless to argue whose deserves a basket. The party will have its headless man either way. If forced the choice, then President Goldwater preferred his head a martyr's.\n\nSo he rose up, gathered his files and empty mug, paced out of the Oval Office, switched the lights out, and called the Republican's bluff before he closed the door shut."

They greeted their allies with warm smiles, their adversaries slightly more fictitious smiles, and voters the brightest smiles PR can beat into their faces. Those wedged uncomfortably between Beltway relevance and Beltway ignominy escaped oversight as Congress strutted like a conga line of peacocks into the Senate and House chambers. Taking their seats, the nation's Congressmen awaited the latest bout of long-standing procedure before another eight hours of business as usual.\n\nSeconds passed into minutes, then half-hours. Heads craning side to side, eyes wide, brows quirked up. No sign of the Vice President.\n\nMurmurs spread throughout the chamber. Someone counted heads -- Republicans, National Progressives, Independents. No Democrats. A good chunk of the seats, barren as a farm half-sunk under billowing dust.

Worse, Thurmond's highly questionable actions of dubious legality have thrown the integrity of the entire system into question. If we are to prevent the political atmosphere from growing even more volatile, we must work to undo the damage left in his wake.\n\nThurmond leaving office has in itself cooled things down by a fair amount, so we have a window of opportunity to make things right. Unfortunately, this can only be achieved by more or less completely undoing his legacy, which will take up considerable time and effort that could have been spent on our own policies.

Though Thurmond no longer holds power, the Supreme Court remains in a corrupted state, and even if we fix this injustice there is nothing to stop it from happening again.\n\nWe must make sure that Thurmond's abuse of legal power can never be repeated.

Should we simply formalize the \"unspoken\" rules of the Supreme Court to make them sacrosanct, or should the whole system of selecting judges be reworked from the ground up?"
 USA_Strom_68_solidify_the_line_of_succession_desc:0 "That Thurmond was able to become President at all was the result of the most staggeringly implausible sequence of events in American political history. That the President and vice President were simultaneously killed while the speaker of the house \"conveniently\" recused himself from taking the position all so the President pro tempore of the Senate could take the title was technically a possibility, but one so utterly unlikely that only the faintest of preparations had been made for it.\n\nIn order to prevent this political equivalent of a royal flush from happening again, there have been calls for a review of the presidential line of succession. Reforming such a crucial element of government process will cost a fair amount of political capital all for something that has an even smaller chance of recurring, but the fact that we are preparing for such a possibility will placate many progressives who have been left spooked by the Thurmond presidency."
 USA_Strom_68_the_abominable_maps_desc:0 "Gerrymandering has always been a problem in America, though President Thurmond took the matter to far more outrageous heights than ever before. No rationale could exist for the voting boundaries created by Thurmond during his term other than to gain dozens of extra seats for his ilk with no change in actual voter share. Even many within the NPP agree that this egregious act of subversion cannot be allowed to stand.\n\nA bill has been introduced in the Senate that would undo most of the damage done by these insipid map games, restoring the boundaries to their pre-64 arrangement. Many pro-Thurmond voices both in and out of the Capitol are already raising a stink over this, though at this point few senators care for the feelings of his clique. The bill is unlikely to face any real opposition."
 USA_Strom_68_the_chimera_in_the_room_desc:0 "Never has the unity of any American political movement imploded so spectacularly than it did for the NPP under President Thurmond. Where before the segregationist and progressive wings were somewhat willing to compromise with one another on matters unrelated to their main causes, now the two rant and rail at each other in the halls of power; a chimera nipping at its own heads.\n\nThe future of the NPP is uncertain. The Republican-Democrats wait on the sidelines, quietly hoping that this will mark the end of their rival as a major political force. But within the pact, there are those who believe this to be the perfect chance to once and for all wrest control of the NPP for their own ends. Now is the time for the power players of American politics to intervene and determine the fate of this anti-establishmentarian monstrosity."
 USA_Strom_68_defining_normal_desc:0 "We have addressed the most glaring offenses of the Thurmond presidency, and things are (for the most part) beginning to calm down. There is a hope amongst those in power that things can finally begin to return to normal. What \"normal\" is, exactly, is a question that still needs to be answered.\n\nThe 1960s have without a doubt been a decade of scandal, change and chaos. President Kennedy championed a new model of civil rights, which Thurmond then resoundingly tore up upon the former's tragic assassination using a number of extremely underhanded tactics. There are still some major decisions to be made regarding both the fate of Thurmond himself and the legacy of President Kennedy - decisions which could radically shift the future of American society and politics forever."
 USA_Strom_68_let_it_go_desc:0 "It is true that Thurmond's actions during his presidency were reprehensible, and that he almost certainly used illegitimate and illegal means to do what he wanted. However, there are many in this country and in politics who still stand by him. Punitive action taken against him would only widen the fractures present in our society, and at a time like this we need to make some compromises. Therefore, we will not take legal action against former President Thurmond.\n\nThere are many who will cry foul over this, but as long as we continue to roll back his worst excesses we should be able to keep them onside, while letting the man walk will be some small comfort to his not insignificant support base."
 USA_Strom_68_the_corrupt_bargain_desc:0 "There is one big question about Thurmond's presidency that remains unanswered: why did the speaker of the house so resolutely refuse the position? The man in question has until now remained quiet on the matter, insisting that he simply could not handle the burdens of power. However, shocking evidence has come to light that suggests a more sinister reason - the speaker was threatened by Thurmond himself so that he could secure the presidency.\n\nThis, combined with Thurmond's other acts of dubious legality, cannot be allowed to stand. We must launch a full federal investigation of Thurmond's activities to uncover any wrongdoing and subversion of the law, and if he is found guilty, he must be punished accordingly. This will make us many enemies amongst the segregationists, but in the interests of American dignity, we must remind everyone that nobody, not even a former President, is above the law."
 USA_Strom_68_strike_a_balance_desc:0 "Thurmond's unceremonious tearing up of President Kennedy's work on civil rights certainly brought unnecessary strife and unrest to America. However, he was not entirely wrong. Kennedy's actions were unnecessary and overreaching, and the protections he granted for racial minorities were excessive. While we do believe civil rights are essential, we will not simply revert ourselves to his tyranny.\n\nWe will begin laying the groundwork for our own civil rights bill, which will ensure a fair and balanced state of living for all Americans. Rather than casting them out like Kennedy did, we will allow the segregationists to have a say on the matter. Progressives and African Americans may be uncomfortable with this, but if we want to heal the many scars in this country, it will not be managed by a bill that does not strike a balance."
 USA_Strom_68_the_dream_lives_on_desc:0 "President Kennedy was swept into power in the hopes of putting an end to the civil rights crisis, and for a brief period he succeeded. The Civil Rights Act brought much needed justice and equality to African Americans and halted the unrest that had spread across the country. All this, only for his tragic death to open the door for Thurmond to come in and rip his work to shreds, reopening the wounds and dividing America even further.\n\nIf we are to truly move on from the troubled days of the Thurmond presidency, we must restore Kennedy's vision after it was so viciously tarnished. Our new civil rights legislation will undo the damage done by Thurmond and his clique, reinstating protections and guarantees for racial minorities. This will no doubt infuriate the remaining segregationists, but after their attempted subversion of American democracy, few others are likely to mind us sidelining them."
 USA_Strom_68_finalize_the_language_desc:0 "The time is drawing near when we can finally put an end to the strife of Thurmond's reign. First, however, we must draft up the legislation we intend to introduce to undo the damages. Though the general ethos and aims of our new course on civil rights has been decided, they say that the devil is in the details, and so we must pay close attention to how this bill is structured - particularly if we want to make sure it can't be undone again at a later date.\n\nClarifying the wording of this bill will make its intentions clear, and should help smooth its passage through to the President's desk. The final result might turn out stronger or weaker than anticipated depending on the precedent we have set so far, and certain people might appreciate or take issue with what comes out the other end. Regardless, now is the time to put pen to paper and give form to the bill that will set us back on the right path."
 USA_Strom_68_the_new_cra_desc:0 "President Thurmond sought to end the march to racial equality through subversive and dangerous means. Today, we resoundingly rebuff this blatant attempt on American democracy and honor the legacy of President Kennedy by bringing our new civil rights bill to vote. Millions have their eyes on Washington as we prepare to make the necessary steps to restore racial justice in this country.\n\nThis bill will revert the damage done by Thurmond, and restore hope to countless souls who once more felt the sting of persecution at his hands. The segregationists scream bloody murder while the progressives breathe a sigh of relief, but for now we must let their voices fade away as senators sit down to vote. Most pollsters agree that after the dark days of Thurmond, this bill will face few obstacles and is almost certain to pass, and soon we can finally move forwards into a future of our own.\n\nWe hope."
 USA_Strom_68_our_work_is_done_desc:0 "We've rolled back the most egregious excesses of Strom Thurmond's misguided abuse of executive power - and we will not stoop to his level in doing so. While all the talk in Washington assumes we will pass a new Civil Rights Act as a final gesture of healing to the nation, we instead contend that we would be dooming America to yet another cycle of partisan division and interstate acrimony. It is not the Federal government's job to do more than it already has to reverse Thurmond's excesses, especially when it would be reaching into the states' authority.\n\nWe have done enough."

There is talk of quietly wrapping up the investigation, to avoid the risk of any more incendiary revelations coming to light and fracturing government and national unity even further.\n\nIf the government had wanted bygones to be bygones, then perhaps that ought to have been their position from the beginning. Regardless, perhaps it is not too late to change course."

 STROM.response.19.desc:0 "When the news leaked that evidence of Thurmond's crimes had been uncovered, a tension began to build once more over America. Segregationists rose up in defiance, calling the allegations fake and defending the character of their Southern gentleman. Progressives rallied in support of the Department of Justice, expectant of a swift and speedy prosecution. The tension built, then held... and held.\n\nWhen more news leaked, it was revealed that the DOJ had been ordered to reverse course and abandon their pursuit of the trail of evidence. The tension broke.\n\nProgressives were apoplectic. Segregationists jeered with joy. The streets became hotter than they'd been since the Thurmond presidency as protests broke out once more. \"The government's sweeping it all under the rug!\" \"The government know they can't get him on anything!\" Depending on who you asked there was a farce for many different reasons, but all the screaming masses could agree that it was a farce.\n\nIf the government had hoped to restore some normalcy with this investigation, they were wrong. Within the Capitol there has not been much more peace than out on the streets, as many begin to criticise the government's \"confused and cowardly\" approach to the investigation. Both the NPP and the RDC grow even more divided by the day.\n\nThurmond looks set to get away with any potential crimes and his successors have egg on their faces. It is safe to say that things couldn't be worse."

 STROM.response.21.desc:0 "Piles of folders, transcripts and other documents covered countless desks within the Department of Justice as investigators worked through the night to sift through the contents. The evidence in question had been collected from offices of former Thurmond administration staffers and clerks, the deep files of the FBI, and from anywhere else that may have been connected to or at least known something about the former President. The work was long and hard, but with such an ample budget supplied to the investigation, those who burned the midnight oil could expect a healthy bonus for their efforts. So they pressed on, long into the early hours of the morning.\n\nIt started with a hunch. A seemingly useless piece of evidence that one of the investigators decided was important - a receipt for a two night stay at a hotel in downtown D.C., in the immediate aftermath of Robert Kennedy's shooting. Two things stood out about it; firstly, though the room was documented in Thurmond's expenses as being paid for by him, it was booked in the name of one of his aides who resigned shortly after he came to power. Secondly, the hotel was only two blocks from the speaker's D.C. residence at the time.\n\nThe aide in question was soon tracked down and interviewed by the investigators. He expressed nervousness and fear of recrimination, though after reassurances that he would be granted protection and anonymity, he relented, and broke. He confessed that his former employer had commanded him to meet with the speaker and present him with some \"unfortunate information,\" to encourage him to \"consider his options.\" When asked if he had any evidence, the former aide nodded, and expressed hope that his cooperation would lift the cloud of shame that languished over him.\n\nFrom amidst disorganized files of old paperwork, he produced a manila envelope which he had presented to the speaker years prior. The contents of the envelope were sensitive and compromising, and the investigators shared looks of trepidation with one another as they realized the severity of what they had uncovered. It was clear as day. Strom Thurmond had threatened the speaker of the house into refusing the presidency, allowing him into the highest office in the land."

 STROM.response.22.desc:0 "After months of investigation into former President Thurmond's activities, the Attorney General today announced that the Department of Justice had concluded all its inquiries, and was prepared to press charges against Thurmond.\n\nThe evidence against Thurmond is certainly damning. The Attorney General revealed that Thurmond had made statements under oath that were provably false by the gathered evidence, and that in the process of the investigation they had also uncovered transcripts that implicated him in illicit financial dealings with various individuals. As to the main charge, the Attorney General confirmed that some evidence had been found concerning the alleged blackmailing of the speaker of the house, but due to the sensitivity of the information he would not elaborate for the time being.\n\nThe entire nation watches with bated breath. With Thurmond's trial scheduled to take place over the coming weeks, it remains to be seen if the bulk of the charges against him will hold. Demonstrations both for and against the former President have broken out across the nation, and the result of the trial will likely have a major impact on the damaged American psyche. As proceedings begin to take place, all anyone can do now is wait."

This court does however find you guilty of one count of perjury and two counts of bribery within a public office. Therefore, though I do not see fit to consign you to jail, I hereby order you to pay a fine of two hundred thousand dollars in damages. You may not have been found guilty of the main charges brought against you today, but that does not mean that your conduct was at all befitting that of a man who held such a prestigious office.\"\n\nA mixed mood has set in across the nation in the wake of the trial's conclusion. Progressives are unhappy that Thurmond has seemingly escaped justice for his most heinous offenses, though are satisfied that the investigation proved that he was not as spotless as the segregationists would say. Conversely, Thurmond's clique have cried foul that he was charged at all, though celebrate that the \"fantasy\" of his blackmail was quashed once and for all. Thurmond himself was seen leaving court earlier today, looking haggard and frustrated, but also relieved.\n\nPerhaps with a few more resources, the investigation could have made the blackmail charge stick. However, some within the administration are quietly thankful that the sentence was not more severe - such a development would be rather incendiary in the current political climate. With a mixed success that has seemingly avoided widespread controversy, it is hoped that the unfortunate legacy of the Thurmond presidency can finally be put to bed."

I am well aware of the significance of your former position, and so I feel it all the more important that this sentence be committed today. Let it be known that no man is above the law.\"\n\nThe mood on the overwhelming majority of the streets was one of elation. Those who had once watched in despair as Thurmond seemingly ran roughshod over American values of liberty and justice now bore witness to the triumph of that same justice against him. Some felt that the sentence was lackluster compared to the severity of the charges, but when most had expected the man to walk as men of power tended to do, the fact that he had been punished at all was enough to provoke outright celebrations across the country.\n\nIn the South, however, the fury was all consuming. Segregationist demonstrations swelled larger than they had been in years, and reports of violence were commonplace. So fanatical were Thurmond's supporters that even now they refused to believe that the charges against him were anything more than a conspiracy. With such a breakdown in discourse, it is unlikely that the administration can expect many seats there in the next election.\n\nRegardless, thanks to the government's generous funding of the investigation, Strom Thurmond will be spending the next few years reflecting on his mistakes. For many, the anger and sacrifice was worth it to watch Thurmond squirm as he left court today, vanishing into a secure wagon to begin his sentence."
