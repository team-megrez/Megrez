 ENG_Michael_Foot:0 "마이클 풋"
 POLITICS_MICHAEL_FOOT_DESC:0 "한 동료 의원은 마이클 풋이 60년대의 의회가 아닌 디즈레일리와 글래드스턴의 시대에 속한 사람이라고 말한 적 있습니다. 교육받지 못한 이에게 이는 터무니없는 것처럼 보일 수 있습니다. 어떻게 급진주의자이자 애틀리와 베번의 후계자이며 망명 노동당 운동의 지도자가 빅토리아 시대의 인물이 될 수 있을까요? 그러나 그 급진적인 겉모습 뒤에는 스위프트와 하퍼에 대한 비판을 노동계급의 곤경만큼이나 줄줄 외울 수 있는 지식인이 있습니다.\n\n풋은 동시대인들과 달리 노동계급에서 태어나지 않았습니다. 자유주의자로 자란 풋은 영국 전역, 특히 자신이 처음으로 사회주의에 헌신하기 시작한 리버풀의 불평등을 목격한 후에야 사회주의에 가입했습니다. 30년대 내내 풋은 주로 저널리즘을 통해 노동당에 헌신했으며, 보수당 정부의 유화 정책에 대한 신랄한 비판을 담은 '길티 맨'을 집필했습니다.\n\n2차 세계대전이 발발하자 풋은 군에 입대하려 했으나 건강 문제로 인해 참전할 수 없었습니다. 그렇지만 그는 국민정부의 실패에도 불구하고 전쟁 노력을 계속 지원했으며, 보수당 정부가 영국을 전쟁에 대비시키지 않은 채 방치하고 그들이 직면하고 있는 바로 그 적과 협력한 것에 대해 계속 지적했습니다. 다른 세계에서는 이러한 수사법이 독일 점령군에 의해 그의 죽음으로 이어졌을 수도 있지만, 이브닝 스탠더드에서 일하면서 친분을 쌓은 비버브룩 경의 개입 덕분에 풋은 캐나다로 대피하여 수천 마일 떨어진 곳에서 점령군을 지켜볼 수밖에 없었습니다.\n\n망명 중에도 낭만주의자였던 풋은 포기하지 않았습니다. 그는 해외에서 계속 활동하며 가장 영향력 있는 망명 지도자 중 한 명이 되었습니다. 영국에 대한 이러한 지속적인 헌신은 결국 그가 탁월한 역량을 발휘하게 된 노동당 당수로의 선출로 이어졌습니다. 노동당 당수로서 그는 MLK와 함께 행진하고 네루와 식사를 하는 등 조국의 해방뿐 아니라 전 세계의 자유를 위해 끊임없이 싸웠습니다.\n\n이제 풋은 마침내 고향으로 돌아왔습니다. 전후 새 예루살렘 건설을 위한 프로그램으로 선거에서 승리한 풋은 막중한 임무를 앞두고 있습니다. 수천 명이 굶주리고 수백만 명이 빈곤에 허덕이며, 수십 년간의 독일 점령으로 약해진 영국 국민은 지원을 요청하고 있습니다. 힘든 일이지만 풋이 성공한다면, 영국에는 적기가 영원히 휘날릴 것입니다."

From the 1930's onwards he has done his best to fight against Fascism, at home and abroad. When the CPGB backed down from the threat Haston stood up against Fascism, splitting from the party and joining the Militant Group. Over the next two decades he would ascend to the leadership of the British Trotskyite movement.\n\nIt could not have come at a worse time, as German boots marched down the streets of Britannia Haston slipped into hiding, even as Great Britain was occupied by the state he despised so much. It was he who began the major Trotskyite force within the Left Resistance, a force he would lead until 1949 when he stepped down to allow a younger generation to lead the revolutionary forces.\n\nThen Colin Jordan and his inbred lackeys seized control of Britain. The leadership of the Revolutionary Communist Party were slaughtered and Haston was the last one left to lead the Revolutionary forces.\n\nNow Britain is a battlefield for the third time in thirty years, and Haston is here to lead the Revolution, to victory or to death he will fight, for a free Britain, to give Fascism a bloody nose, and to bring the Revolution to Albion's shores."

On the other hand, others argue that for our regime to finally be seen as legitimate, and to regain the trust of the British public, it is necessary for our armed forces to once again stand on its own without the assistance of our benefactors. Regardless of the opinions of the various factions and individuals on the issue, it is true that the matter of our army needs to be settled, and soon."

But despite this, in the light of the New Order, our military can be rebuilt, stronger and sturdier than it ever was before. This new army shall be reborn, crafted with the spirit of the old and the ideals of the New Order, trained with superior arms and moulded into the face of safety against the ever gnawing resistance in the eyes of the people.

The most efficient move would be to give control of what's left of the army to the Germans, supporting the Garrison in its ventures. Whilst some may perceive such a move as tethering the country even further to the Reich, the wiser amongst us recognise that it would be a sure-fire way to ingratiate ourselves even further to our German benefactors - and their aid is something we cannot afford to let slip.

Yet this influence offers us a major advantage, as Wulf sees our defence plans hinge more and more on him, his trust in the government can only skyrocket, allowing for a more trustworthy German Garrison, meaning not only more security within the realm, but in our own government.\n\nWith such grand friends within the German army, what does our government have to fear?"

Nothing.\n\nUnder their negligent watch, we have had no less than two Judeo-Bolshevik uprisings that almost toppled our New Order, many voices within our government cry out for total obliteration, to wipe the slate clean and start anew with a fresh fascist history.

The liberals too thought that they were the champions of the workers, promoting foolish ideas like democracy.\n\nBut there is one group that truly fights for the workers, and always will without any frills or lies. Fascism is the good, honest flame of liberation that will secure Britannia's workers the rights and glory that they have earned.

The nation strikes as one against the chains of Global Finance, Capital, and Judeo-Bolshevism.\n\nWhat a sad ruin it has become. Once it was a tool for the workers, and now? Now, it is a petty tool of the mega corporations to exploit the German worker for their own profits, in their own slavery to Finance Capital. Well, that may have happened in Germany.

 britain_intros.7.d:0 "                    CONFIDENTIAL FILES-FOR CABINET ONLY\n\nSince the conclusion of hostilities in Britain, a large portion of the post war resistance has been made up of the so called 'left resistance' remnants of old soldiers, leftist dissidents and Unions. Despite our efforts to appease and break the unions, they have remained a prominent breeding ground for Bolshevik terrorists, and act a key organisations within the resistance body. Since the seeming disappearance, and suspected death of Ernest Bevin, a previously unknown figure, Jack Jones has stepped up to lead this sect of HMMLR.\n\nLittle is known of Jones early life, bar his past as a Liverpool Docker and shop steward yet it seems he gained his Bolshevism early on, joining unions during this period and acting as a spokesperson for Socialism. It even seems as if, according to reports from Blackshirts at the time, he has been a long enemy to us, acting as an early opponent to fascism, apparently fighting during many of Mosely's rallies. According to one report from a former Blackshirt, he helped rally organised protest-meetings against the fascists in Liverpool, and was beaten up by a group of Blackshirts armed with knuckle-dusters.\n\nOur next reports of him comes from the first victory for fascism of the 30s, the Spanish civil war in which he continued his misguided crusade, fighting in the international brigades against the Nationalist government, most likely fighting in the \"Abraham Lincoln\" XV International Brigade. It is from this conflict that our last photo of the man comes from (found on page 5), being taken as part of the records from the army. Our Intel for this originates from German intelligence, who Scavenged from the ruins of the Kremlin, within the records kept on international allies. Unfortunately, most of the file on him was lost in the battle of Moscow.\n\nNot much is known of him from this point until the late 50s, where he seems to mysteriously reappear as the leader of the left resistance. It is my opinion that killing Jack Jones should not be a priority of the government, for the man himself is not the cause of our issue, we should instead seek to root out the infrastructure surrounding the unions leaving them unable to organise. With this, the serpent will be unable to regrow, and we can move to crushing the body once and for all."

Unlike their left resistance counterparts, the SOE is seemingly a small, highly professional organisation, consisting mainly of former soldiers from the war. First commanded by David Stirling (Profile can be found on page 16), the role as commander has been taken up by Sir Fitzroy Hew Royle Maclean, a clansman out of his depth.\n\nBorn to Major Charles Wilberforce Maclean in Cairo, he was descended from the Macleans of Ardgour, a sept of clan Maclean. He was brought up in Italy, going on to be educated at Eton and Cambridge, finishing his studying in Germany before going onto join the diplomatic service, posted to Moscow in 1937. Maclean was present for much of the failures of the Judeo Bolshevik regime, seeing the economic failures of Bukharin first hand, as well is meeting with numerous Communist figures during this period; Maclean was able to travel the union extensively. It is rumoured by some German sources that Macleon made a few key contacts during this period.\n\nOnce War broke out, Maclean resigned from the service to join the military, serving with distinction in North Africa in some of the first actions of the SAS in 1942, later effectively crushing the German network in Persia. He would be chosen by Churchill himself to lead a liaison mission to Yugoslavia in 1943, linking up with the Bolshevik partisans led by Joseph Broz Tito. Not much is known of their relationship, but records from Italian, Croatian and German troops in the region seem to suggest that he took part in Partisan activities, seemingly learning from their techniques. From this point on, records seem to imply that he left in early 1945, yet instead of going into exile, it seems he returned to Isles, joining the SOE under Stirling.\n\nSince taking over the SOE, he has seemingly learnt from Tito's own partisan strategy (whose summary can be seen on page 8) Maclean has shifted the SOE strategy from Stirling's 'mad bomber' attitude to a protected warfare strategy to maintain SOE's strength in the long term."

He nearly frowned upon seeing the man. Many in the family spoke of how he was far too left-wing, despite being so high up in the BPP.\n\nWilson smiled at them. \"Fresh blood, I see. Come in, please, sit. We were just about to start.\" Martin nodded, assuming that Wilson would be handing the stage over to one of the other civil servants so that they could chair the meeting. But what happened next shocked him. \"Alright then, gentlemen, let's get started. It's been a hard couple of months for everyone here, and it will only get harder with the workers getting agitated. However, we cannot stand to let standards slip and fall behind us. I believe you had a plan, Colin?\"\n\nMartin blinked. He and the other civil servants in the room had only just sat down, yet Wilson seemed to have taken the executive decision to chair the meeting. The junior civil servant almost scoffed. The other men in the room were several times his senior. Surely, they would soon remind him of his place. Instead, he was shocked as the man Wilson addressed nodded his head respectfully, going into detail.\n\nHe was in shock. Wilson was able to simply get away with this. How? Martin's shock only worsened as Wilson asked for a copy of the Fisher Report - something even Martin knew was above his station. And yet, another of the men whipped a copy out and gave it to him. The entire meeting, he moved them around like puppets. By the time it ended, Martin was almost catatonic as Wilson opened the door, and they all followed behind him."

For him, the only solution lay in the past, in the face of the Great Martyr of Fascism, Oswald Mosley, shot by the cowardly and treasonous government as the Germans made landfall. They thought that his death would snuff out the fire he lighted long ago, but to their dismay, the fire grew and engulfed them, purging Britain of its rotten \"democracy\" and the parasites that subsisted on it.\n\nFlipping over another page, Jeffrey let his thoughts subside for a moment, it was true, fascism had finally come to Britain, and it had come quicker than he expected, yet he still couldn't see the people in charge as anything other than opportunistic hawks unable to do anything but steer his nation to fruitless paths, it was no coincidence to him that as the government strayed ever further from Mosley's vision, the more problems seemed to arise. But hope was not lost, as Hamm knew the only way for orthodoxy to be restored, and that was through Andrew Fountaine, the charismatic rising ideologue among a party of conservative leftovers and indecisive moderates, through him he could finally implement his uncompromised vision.\n\nHe allowed himself a moment of rest and looked up to gaze at his modest office, above the door leading to the rest of the building, there was a hanging portrait of Oswald Mosley, Jeffrey allowed himself to drift looking at the ageless features and the immaculate suit of his martyred leader.

That being said, even the Koh-I-Noor Diamond had to be cut before it reached its true potential. Looking over the term \"revolutionary spirit\", his eyebrows shot up. The entire paragraph could possibly be misconstrued as pro-Bolshevism. Bean cursed the curs for soiling the spirit of the common man, before crossing that sentence out.\n\n\"Though the will of the people is inimical to the development of a strong, nationally coherent society, it is important that the government and the state exercises a necessary guiding hand, so that the revolutionary spirit is directed away from Judeo-Bolshevik corruption towards an end that will the benefit of the nation itself.\"\n\nHe nodded to himself, satisfied.

It really was ever so petty.\n\nAs Prime Minister Domvile finished his speech, Birdwood joined in the applause, some measure for more German investment, no doubt proposed by that little rat Butler who was sitting next to the PM. The House of Commons was simply too... Common, for a woman like her. It had been all so wonderful when she was elected in 1953, getting to meet such titans like Chesterton and Domvile, back when the proper sort of people still held dominance in both Houses. And then it had all come tumbling down.\n\nFountaine. The name echoed venomously through her mind when she saw the traitor stand to give a speech of his own. It was men like him and Butler, along with their packs of cretins, who dominated the Commons. Most of her old friends had either moved up to The Lords or simply died.

These parties were their lifeblood in more ways than one, integral for the intricate system of patronage core to the faction's health, but also a nostalgic display of Britain's glory days.

Her fellow cabinet member was deep in conversation with a pair of backbench MPs whom she recognised as old ministers from Chesterton's ill-fated Ministry, nothing too important she would be interrupting then.\n\n\"Ronald!

The other paramilitaries quickly formed a shield of sorts around the group of harassed fascist MPs, protecting them from the projectiles hurled across the Thames from Westminster bridge by the rioters.\n\nAlmost running to the nearest entrance to Parliament now, held open by terrified clerks like the portcullis of a besieged fortress, Birdwood struggled not to scream. This was a nightmare, it had to be. HMMLR was dead, it was destroyed, it couldn't have rebuilt itself so quickly, couldn't have outmanoeuvred them so completely.\n\nCould they?\n\nSuddenly, the smoke-filled air and furious shouting were replaced with ancient walls and frantic discussions, the doors behind the MPs slammed shut as their Blackshirt escort peeled off to aid the beleaguered Police. It took everything she had for Birdwood to not fall to her knees in sheer relief.\n\n\"Minister Birdwood! I need a moment to talk.\" Came the stress-strained voice of Reginald Maudling, crossing over to his nominal rival. \"I've got a bill ready to stem the bleeding from our trade but a few of you Old Guards are dissenting. Nall-Cain's given the green light, could you please ask them to vote aye? We need unity.\""

Whilst the Uprising was long since over, she still remembered the rioting hordes, biting her nails as she listened to garrison reports on HMMLR movements, and that one brick that missed her by an inch.\n\nBut the bout of jitters soon faded as she sat down next to the man who'd invited her for a meeting on this cold morning, and was looking far better than the last time she saw him.\n\n\"Jane, it's good to see you again.\" Said A.K Chesterton, standing up and shaking her hand before the pair sat back down. \"It really has been far too long since we spoke.\" He added, a sense of purpose in his voice that she hadn't heard for years.\n\n\"It truly has been Arthur, I'm glad to see you look well.\" She responded, setting her handbag aside and leaning on the table. \"While we wait for the waiter to arrive, why is it you've invited me out here?\"\n\n\"Well, you know how Gerard is considering his hat in the ring for PM given the mess Fountaine's making?\" He said, Birdwood nodding in response. \"Let's just say that I'm... Planning a comeback of sorts if he should win. And I was wondering if-\"\n\n\"No need to wonder Arthur, you have my full support unconditionally.\" She interrupted, a grin spreading across Chesterton's face.\n\n\"Thank you, I think I know a cabinet post you'd truly excel in as well, its long past time a woman of your calibre represented our nation to others don't you think?\" He said, almost conspiratorially, drawing a similar smile from Birdwood. As the waiter arrived with a menu, the pair steered back to less covert topics, and reminisced of older days. Days that may well be young again once more."

The Old Guard would see it done, and she would be the one to present its successes and cover up its failures to the world.\n\nBut there was even more to it than that. The power dynamics of the BPP had dramatically shifted once more, and she found herself as a key card in Chesterton's deck. Whilst the unity of the government was assured given the very nature of its composition, the details of their plans still had to be filled in, and any of the three new cliques within the Old Guard could be holding the pen.\n\nThat however, was for the future. Opening up her new ministerial box and getting to work, Birdwood's first order of business would be a trip to Germany to lay the foundations for the future equal partnership the Old Guard envisioned. Calling in her private secretary, she began to dictate a telegram to the British embassy in Germania to start preparations for her trip."

Yet now, it plays host to a cabal of fascists, traitors and cowards - easily Britain's most despised Cabinet, and led by a man who is the worst of the lot - Prime Minister Barry Domvile, the arch-traitor.\n\nToday, he was meeting with Maxwell Knight, the head of MI5, about the ongoing rebel activity throughout the nation.\n\n\"So, Mr Knight, I expect a full analysis of these \"Terrible Twins\", their goals, and what forces they can call upon to upset order.\"\n\n\"Of course - we have already been gathering intelligence on these two men, and once we have gathered enough we will prepare a full report on each.\"\n\n\"Excellent. There is another matter, as well. I've heard rumours that these two men are coordinating together, and are being led by some sort of go-between who is taking charge of a united resistance command.\"\n\nKnight jerked involuntarily at that, and then recovered, responding quickly with, \"That would be highly unlikely in my view, sir. One of the Twins is a known Bolshevik, whereas the other is a supporter of the Exiles over in Canada. I don't believe that they would have either the mental capacity or the political will to be collaborating with each other.\"\n\nDomvile eventually nodded in agreement, and Knight went off to prepare his report."

Though the highlands still acts as a hotbed of resistance, the mountains serving as the perfect hiding places for the resistance, the southern regions have remained stable.\n\nThe most noteworthy activity this month was in Glasgow, where a cell of SOE members seemed to have been attempting to disrupt an arms shipment, en route to Glasgow from a factory down south. Though they successfully stopped the shipment, the extra squad I recommended on the shipment seemed to have caught them off guard, leading to a quick retreat by the forces. From here, the squad was whittled away as they fled through the city, eventually holding up in a pub near the centre of the town. Inside the building was the owner of the pub, alongside several patrons of the establishment, all of whom were seemingly taken as hostages by the four remaining terrorists. Luckily, however, thanks to the brave actions of a certain Sergeant Thomas, the terrorists were shot dead with no civilian casualties.\n\nMy recommendations are thus continue our current approach, which seems to be working at stabilising the region. The carrot and stick method appears to be successful, as the population warms to our presence while resistance activity in the regions steadily decreases. In time, the south will be stable enough to act as a launching pad, from which we can route the SOE out of the hills once and for all."

They also both held a distaste towards the pro-German British government, as their families had opted to collaborate after the fall of London. With their shared passion and revolutionary fervour, they had decided to join the \"Workers Armed Forces\", a small Trotskyist sect which belonged to the fast network of the British resistance.\n\nThe couple took their new affiliation in stride. They organised clandestinely among Newcastle university, they had co-written propaganda, and had even constructed a small bomb to use against their local police depot. Although these actions would draw them great respect from their comrades, it drew the ire of the state in equal measure.During the small hours of the morning, whilst they were asleep in each other's embrace, they had been apprehended by officers of MI5, and were drawn up on charges of sedition against the crown and England."

The premises which had been held under surveillance were raided this morning by some 100 armed police officers and 25 infantrymen from the army. The raids were fruitful; some 50 insurgents aligned with the Trotskyist wing of the Left Resistance were found and arrested. They are currently being interrogated in a combined effort of MI5 and the BFC. They have yet to yield any further information on the whereabouts of the other cells within the city nor that of Jones or MacLean.

In fact, it was the best news he had received in a while - sans the reports of slaughter and carnage that followed Haller-Cooper. He frowned at the thought of the butcher. The man was useful in the same way a sledgehammer was - a blunt instrument, to be thrown at the problem with little care for civilian casualties or fallout. If the captured resistance members weren't treacherous dogs, then Domvile would almost feel bad for letting him loose upon them in the interrogation rooms.\n\nKnight, on the other hand, was dependable.

He didn't make a habit of coming out in the middle of the night and staring at the river, of course; he was here to meet a very special someone.\n\n\"Who rules the waves?\" asked a voice from behind him. He turned, seeing that it was the man he had come here to meet; Maxwell Knight. He smirked. \"We both know the answer to that question,\" he replied. Knight nodded slowly, before walking over and clapping James on the back. \"How goes everything, James?\" the Spymaster asked. McGuirk hummed. \"More of the same, really. The Americans and Japanese are up to their usual malarkey. Grayling said that it's apparently much the same in the Mediterranean, as well.\" Knight nodded, taking the news in stride. \"And as for...?\"\n\nMcGuirk frowned. \"No news from Germania yet on that front. The matter is becoming more and more urgent, but still manageable.\" Knight's brow creased somewhat at this, and he nodded again. For a few moments, there was silence between the two men. Then, McGuirk spoke up again. \"Apparently Joyce is having a good enough time down there.\" Knight scoffed, a small smile forming on his face. \"Of course he is. All those Germanian women for him to enjoy.

If they had let it go on any longer they'd have brought out the chains to keep them at their station during work hours and beds so they could live in the damn factory with the grease and the machines.\n\nLabour had taken several hits ever since this nation lost its independence, but the British people weren't broken. The worker was still ready to fight for their rights. Despite attempts by the lords and the bosses, they still were here. And they were not going to accept being made to work like the slaves across the channel. The whole factory had joined in, gathering around the factory. The factory was loud indeed, but not with the sound of work, but with yells!\n\nThe bosses were lambasted for their greed, the scabs throughout the country denounced for their treachery, and the government was castigated for abandoning the rights of the worker to the preference of the boss. A revolving roulette of complaints made clear and evident. The union was bringing on their strongest performance, and in so doing, though the sky was deary, it did nothing to dim their attitudes.

Eventually, Phillips could not keep up the charade and made things clear. \"Mr. Domvile, our demands were plenty reasonable in the first place.

An ambitious snake, surely, Domvile could understand the look in his eyes too well; he aimed to replace him, once he stepped down. It seems not even a decade under the new order could not wipe out careerism from this blasted country. Still, he couldn't deny that Butler did good work...\n\nYet he looked back upon others. Butler was a naked careerist, but if there was anyone who understood the necessity of strength within Britain, it would be Fountaine. The man had always fought for the fascist cause, in Spain, and here. He was one of the first men to join him. But the men he surrounded himself with...

He waved off a few attempts to follow him, going alone through the crowd. With confidence that he wouldn't be attacked... Of course not, the man didn't have anyone defending him, but the government would hunt every last one of them down if they laid a finger on him.\n\nButler tried to walk confidently, but Phillips could see the bead of sweat on his person as he walked up.

Start off strong.\n\nTo the toad's credit, he got straight to the point. \"I will concede we've failed in our duties to you. But tell us what we can do now to make it right.\" Now it was Phillips caught off guard. If there was a time to give a list of grievances it was now. \"For starters, the rate of work has been getting more and more intense. We're expected to work ourselves to the bone, for barely a fraction of the pay our fathers would have received. Our working conditions are shite as well, the boss wishes he had bought slaves and instead he's trying to turn us into slaves.\"\n\nA simple nod from him. \"Tell me everything.\" Slowly, over the course of a long conversation, and solution-oriented suggestions from both parties, the strikers and the BPP built a comprehensive list of workplace reforms.

His line had broken, and he along with them, turning around as the police charged in, bloodlust in their eyes.\n\nThe strike had devolved from an orderly protest into a chaotic riot. Sometimes the strikers would catch a cop out of formation and beat him with all the strength they could muster before they too were struck down by further police. Those who had fortified themselves would find themselves choking on the gas. Some had broken lines by throwing Zhdanov cocktails, while others had stubbornly planted themselves to buy time for the others to escape. By the time the strike has been broken, several people had died.\n\nMadison couldn't stick around, but the screams stayed in his mind. As he ran as fast as he could. He could still hear them.

He looked at the wall, where a painting of his father sat, from the height of his reign at the end of the Great War and the zenith of the Empire. His father had been a great King, leading the Empire through the turmoil of the War and the post-war years. Calm and serious, he had been truly dedicated to the crown, Albert had been just like him.\n\nAlbert, he'd always been his father's son, as dedicated to the crown as George had been.

He was the better King in the end, a serious, caring man, a King perfect for the war.\n\nOh, the war, the infernal war; it was a war wanted by nobody but the militarists within the cabinet, all so eager to draw Britain towards another bloodbath. He had seen the carnage of the First World War, all those young boys marching pointlessly to their deaths, mowed down in the prime of their youth. Besides, Hitler was not that bad of a chap, and time after time offered Britain fair peace deals, yet the war went on.

The best way to get them to moderate their demands was then... \"I'll go in myself and talk to them. Surely the Prime Minister himself answering a strike will encourage them to negotiate.\"\n\nButler privately cursed himself for his sloppiness.

He had found that if they had increased, somehow, then it set him up with something to deal with the day after. If it had gone down, then he could rest easy knowing that Britain was growing safer under his charge. And thankfully, it was good new tonight. Left Resistance activity had been all but suppressed in East Anglia, and the BFC had pre-emptively stopped an SOE bombing in Lancashire.\n\nA small smile formed on the admiral's wrinkled face.

With batons and military discipline they tried to beat the raging fans into submission, but it soon became apparent that they were outnumbered and faced with a now united front against their very presence. In a short time, the English ceased focusing on beating each other's teeth out of their mouths and began taking notice of the foreigners in their midst.\n\nWith chants of \"Fuck off, Germs!\" the soldiers were soon forced out of the stadium and into the streets, dragged and beaten bloody by knuckle dusters and crumbled newspapers. People who didn't even watch the match were gathering around and cheering as the whole brawl slowly turned into an roaring anti-German protest, with it reaching the mayor's office before promptly being dispersed by native police forces.\n\nLater, the papers spoke of a \"football match gone too far\", and how the perpetrators would be punished for their misdeeds. Unfortunately for the injured Germans, there wasn't much they could push for when it came to prosecuting the ones responsible, as it was only an unofficial job, some of them thought that perhaps it was purposefully arranged so by the bookers of the match. Nevertheless, arrest warrants were pressed by the German Garrison government as well as by the Reich itself, leading to arrests of over twenty people suspected for inciting the riot and committing violence against the German soldiers. As the weeks and months went by, the match became the talk of the town, used as both a gesture of unity and an insult to the German occupiers."

 domvile_flavour.16.d:0 "Of the many things Butler was doing to amass support for his growing Pragmatist coalition and eventual leadership bid for the BPP, having tea on the House of Lord's terrace was by far one of the more pleasant ones. Though the stakes were high as ever, it was a far calmer atmosphere than the riotous Commons or tribal BPP Headquarters. Nothing but tea, biscuits and a vital front in the war for Britain's soul.\n\n\"Look Mr Butler, a lot of us would quite frankly prefer you to win over that glorified thug Fountaine, but you have to admit that your proposed reforms have made us... Uneasy. Do you really have to strip our power in such a way? I don't see anyone else arguing for such drastic action.\" Said one of the influential Lords present, a leader in the moderate faction Butler had to court if he wanted to win once Domvile kicked the bucket.\n\n\"I recognise that you all may have some... Trepidation, about my proposed reforms, but please my Lords, they are vital to restoring our people's trust in us and faith in Parliament. You will still have the powers of delay and amendment, whilst not as strong as an outright veto, they are still powerful, and more than enough to check the Commons if they do something stupid, as quite a few of my fellow MPs so often do.\"\n\nThe joke went down well with the Lords, who seemed to be warming to Butler's idea. Seeing his opportunity to secure their support and turn them against Fountaine for good, Butler struck whilst the iron was hot.\n\n\"Do take for instance, some of the proposals brought forth by some of Fountaine's gang recently. That Bean fellow sounds almost like a communist in his rhetoric. Not that the others sound less moronic mind you, the other fellow, Hamm, was going on about the need for a \"Syndicalist economy\" too, with quite alarming implications for our social status quo.\"\n\nThe Lords nodded in agreement, with the Peer who spoke before raising his voice again. \"I think I speak for us all when I say it is better to give away some power to decent chaps than risk it all on some unpredictable louts, very well Mr Butler, you have our support.\""

All of a sudden, however, Bobby jumped into the room with a look of glee on his face. \"He's dead!\" the young man yelled. \"He's finally gone and corked it!\"\n\nEveryone was silent for a moment.

If it was snowing she would go outside to play in it with her friends, before they called her in for a large dinner. Of course as she grew older, there was less frolicking around in the snow and more sneaking in illicitly gained bottles of beer, but the spirit remained the same.\n\nThis Christmas was very different, to say the least. For one, she was not gently roused from a comfortable bed, but awoken at five in the morning by a loud screeching noise. She shot up, blearily trying to reach for the gun she kept at her bedside. Elizabeth was quicker, leaping out of bed and looking around. \"What is that? Emma! Wake up Emma, what the hell is that?\" she asked as her partner shook herself awake. \"No idea.\" she said, running outside. As it turned out, they had all been equally as confused - Old Bill later clarified that it was a faulty air raid siren that had been triggered by the snow. He hadn't seen this as a downside however - as the de facto leader of their cell, he had gotten everyone to participate in a gift-giving exercise, and the early get-up only meant they could do it earlier.\n\nSo, there Emma and Elizabeth sat, drinking the lukewarm mugs of tea and trying to fight off the bitingly cold air that threatened to come into their tent. \"So,\" Emma said, chuckling nervously. \"I couldn't exactly scrounge up much this year, but...\" she paused, before producing a necklace. \"It was my mum's.

It was less costly of course, but I did have to bribe Ginger with a few cigarettes.\" As Emma looked at it, she realised what it was - it was a picture of their cell in that old cigarette factory, grinning and smiling.

Old Bill had encouraged them to not be disheartened by the news, and yet Emma was sitting as rigid as a plank of wood in bed as Elizabeth softly cuddled her. How that woman managed to brush past the existential dread was a mystery to her.\n\nShe shifted slightly, knees jabbing into her back. Emma sighed, trying desperately to settle down. \"What's the matter, love?\" Elizabeth asked. Emma almost wanted to scream - she had woken her up. \"Don't worry about it, jus' go back to sleep.\" She could practically feel the stare boring into her side.

Her exit from her home had not been a smooth one - she had been rushed onto the boat in the dead of night by Old Bill alongside the other passengers, gunfire echoing in the background. It was possible that the old man could have caught another boat, she supposed. Perhaps they would meet again one day.\n\nA child on the other side of the boat began crying, his mother desperately trying to comfort him. Emma didn't know any of their stories, although she had gleaned from the scant conversation that had been made that everyone on the boat was affiliated with the resistance in some way or another. A fine lot they must have looked like - bedraggled, bereft, and defeated.\n\nIf Elizabeth was here, she would have had something comforting to say. She would have been chirping about all the possibilities their new life opened up for them - how they could live together away from the burdens of their old one. Or maybe she could have alleviated the bitingly cold sea air by holding her, getting lost in her arms. But that was not to be. Suddenly, a large dark silhouette could be seen in the distance. Everyone on the boat immediately perked up. As they drew closer, it became clear what the figure was.\n\nIt was the Statue of Liberty.\n\nThey had arrived in New York. Muted elation could be heard across the boat - most were too drained to get too physical. Emma smiled, taking out a wrinkled photo. It was one they had taken just before the uprising had begun, where they were still hiding in the attic of that old factory. Lizzie's greyscale face smiled back at her, alongside all the other comrades she knew were no longer with her. Emma held the photo to her chest, whispering softly."

Shifts at the factory were getting later and later, which meant she often ended up falling asleep before he got back. Slinging his raggedy bag on the kitchen table, he walked over to the pantry, feeling absolutely famished after a day of nonstop labouring. Those German taskmasters did not like to let up for anything, it felt like.\n\nStill, money was money, he pondered, taking out some bread, margarine and preserved meat from the cupboard. He was a fit and healthy lad and it was just him and his mum. If he didn't bring in any money, then nobody would, and the bills would go unpaid. But as he spread the margarine onto the bread, he couldn't help but wonder one thing.\n\nHow many more nights like this? How long would it be until he went onto bigger and better things? Or would he stay in this city until the day he died like Dad did?\n\nShaking his head, Ben sat down and tucked into the sandwich. The ingredients were all extremely cheap, but after his shift, it could've been a five-star meal in his eyes. It would be the same again tomorrow, and the same the day after that. Maybe on Sunday he'd be able to properly relax, for once."

You're barely out of school, for goodness sakes!\"\n\nKnocked off-kilter by the unexpected smack, Ben quickly snapped back. \"Oh, and I'm old enough to work in some dingy old factory all day, am I? At least this way I'm not wasting my life, and I'm actually doing something for once!\"\n\nShe scoffed, folding her arms. \"A waste of a life is it? Is that what you think about your dad? Did he waste his life then?\" Silence fell over the mother and son, as the unspoken presence of the missing family member made itself known. She put her hands over her eyes, and began to sob gently. \"Not you too, Ben. I can't lose you too. I just can't.\"\n\nBen's expression softened, and he pulled his mother into a firm hug. \"Mum, I swear that I'll be back, I promise you.\" he said, lightly patting her on the back. \"I'm gonna come back home, and we'll be much better off.

They had been in basic training just a few weeks ago when all of a sudden, they had been ordered to ship out to the capital and that it was a state of abject emergency. There had been no direct confirmation of what was going on just yet, but rumours would always spread. And these rumours were shockingly consistent.\n\nIt was being said that Downing Street had been blown up with the Prime Minister inside.\n\nBen didn't quite want to believe it - he neither looked up to nor disliked the Prime Minister on a personal level. Indeed, how many Englishmen of his age could genuinely claim to hold much in common with the likes of Barry Domvile? But he was still the man who lead Ben's country alongside the King himself, and when he joined the army Ben had sworn to defend both King and Country. To have the resistance attack both so brazenly like this could only mean trouble, and he did not like it one bit.\n\nAs the old military transport trundled down the road, few of the men were speaking. Usually they would be joking around with each other by now, or at least exchanging words with each other. But instead, it felt as if they were gathered at a funeral. Hushed whispers were exchanged as many of them stared vacantly onwards. They all knew what they had signed up for in joining the military, but none of them would have expected for anything major to occur this soon.\n\nIt was at this moment that Ben could suddenly remember what his mother had said to him when he told her that he had signed up.

They readied their weapons and stepped in, only to see a nine-year old girl sobbing on the floor, clutching a dirty doll and sitting next to a pile of rubble. Underneath it, a single pale hand was sticking out.\n\nThey just stood there, shocked at the sight. Swallowing, Ben decided to be the one to talk to her. \"Hello,\" he said softly. \"What's your name?\"\n\nThe girl didn't respond initially, only looking down, clutching her doll for dear life. \"Are mummy and daddy going to be alright?\" she asked, looking up at him. Ben felt something deep inside him waver. The girl had to know on some level that her parents were never coming back, but that would never make it easier to tell her.\n\n\"No. I'm sorry, they've gone to heaven now.\" he said, as calmly as he could. The girl's face plummeted even further, and she began to sob. Panicking, Ben put his hand on her shoulder. \"Shh. There, there. I know you must be very scared and sad right now, but if you come with me and my friends here, we can get you somewhere safe. How about that, eh?\" He extended his hand.\n\nShe looked at him warily, before taking it. Ben forced a soft smile. He knew that she would probably be shipped off to an orphanage as soon as they got back to base - hopefully she'd find a good family. But the pain would never leave her. She had lost everything in this war. As they left the ruined house, he turned back and looked, coming to one realisation."

The soldier coughed, breathing heavily. \"Just stay with me mate, yeah? Help'll be on its way soon. Do you have a name?\"\n\nA moment passed, and Ben feared that the soldier had just passed away in his arms. \"Adolf,\" he said, wheezing. \"Mein name ist Adolf.\" Ben sighed with relief. That explained the German military insignia on his clothes, at the very least.\n\n\"Adolf, eh? Well, I s'pose it's no great wonder who you were named after then.\" He joked, trying to lighten the mood. The German looked to be around his age - a youthful face with only wisps of a blonde moustache growing. Ben briefly wondered whether he had even chosen to join the Garrison like he had the army - and that he probably had family at home as well.\n\nHe let out a wet gurgle that could be construed as a laugh. \"Well, that is what many of you Englishmen think,\" he said, a strained ghost of a smile on his lips. \"But it was actually my uncle Adolf-Hans, not the Führer.\" A loud bang came about five metres away, and that smile faded. \"Go. There is no use dying for me.\"\n\nThere was a grim determination on his face, but Ben would not be rattled. \"I'm not leaving another man behind. I don't know how they do it in Germany, but over here we take care of our soldiers. It's just a flesh wound, anyway. Now, MEDIC!\" he shouted once again, his throat searing in pain.

Of course, as the night went on, activity began to peter out. But Ben and Adolf had remained out, sipping their beer and looking at the sky.\n\nThe two men had remained close after Ben had rescued him. He had requested to be transferred to their unit from his own all-German one, forever grateful that Ben hadn't left him to die. They could often be seen with each other, cracking jokes and such. Ben decided that he liked it. He had friends back in Birmingham and obviously respected his brothers-in-arms, but it was good to have someone he could confidently call a close friend.\n\n\"You know,\" Adolf said, breaking the silence. \"My father didn't want me to join the army.\" Ben sat up - Adolf hadn't mentioned his family before.\n\n\"Really? I would've thought that you Germans would be... well, a bit more eager to help with serving your country, given the... well...\" Ben gesticulated vaguely.\n\nAdolf laughed. \"Ha! I can understand what you mean. But no, he was an accountant and wanted me to stay and help with the firm. But it was my mother who told me I should do whatever I wish to serve the fatherland. And here I am.\" He said, waving his mug in the air. \"Merry old England!\"\n\nBen laughed in turn, shaking his head. \"It's funny you should mention that, actually.

Lo, it was Adolf, covered in as much crap as he was.\n\n\"Yeah, bloody wonderful innit.\" he scoffed. \"Perfect weather for a picnic, don't you think? Why don't we get the lovely lads over there for a nice cuppa, and we can settle this peacefully.\" The \"lovely lads over there\" in this case were an enclave of SOE operatives that were holding a village hostage. He had already heard two shots from their side, and seen a few bodies dumped on the outskirts - presumably because they weren't \"cooperating\" nicely enough with their captors. It was their job to chuck them out.\n\nAdolf let out another hearty chuckle, shaking his head. \"You know, I have been thinking. When my grandfather was last in a war, it would have been against your grandfather. When my father was in a war, it would have been against your father. And now, here we both are! Standing right by each other. It is funny, no?\" Ben snorted.\n\n\"I s'pose that's how we get 'round world peace then.

They had been sent there to try and root out a group of resistance fighters who had been sighted coming in and out of the woods for the past week.\n\nHe wasn't too familiar with these three men - Adolf and the rest of his usual comrades had been assigned to the city, where they'd be doing much of the same, only in an urban environment. Ben could have used a break from the inner city for a while, he supposed. 17 years there does that to a man. Seeing a faint plume of smoke in the distance, Ben held up his hand, gesturing for the men to stop. \"Alright,\" he whispered. \"Looks like we've found them. Now-\"\n\nBefore he could speak, a bullet went through the head of the man at the back, his blood spraying over the two in front of him. Chaos erupted as two men from the resistance burst from the trees, each firing indiscriminately at the other two men. Ben moved to try and dodge out of the way, but before he could, he felt cold steel press against his neck as a strong, slender arm grabbed his torso.\n\nHe struggled, desperately trying to keep his neck away from the knife. He reached for the gun holstered to his waist and pulled the trigger, firing twice behind him. Whoever was holding him fell to the floor, choking, He turned around, seeing that it had been a blonde woman dressed in camouflage clothes. A scream came from further in the forest. Ben looked up, seeing that it came from a dark haired woman further in the woods.\n\nBen's life flashed before his eyes. All the other men were dead, and the other resistance fighters were bound to be closing in. He ran, trying not to let the image of the man's blown-open head or the blonde woman's face haunt him."

Except for the roof - there was a large hole in it that had certainly not been here last time he had checked. Clutching his rucksack, he approached the front door, hearing people chatting with each other inside. It must have been a family get together. He was lucky that their unit was to be stationed in Birmingham for the next few months before they went back to camp - he needed to know everyone was alright.\n\nHe knocked three times, and he heard what sounded like his mother approaching. \"I'll get it!\" she said, and the door swung open. \"Hello mum.\" Ben said, not quite knowing what else to say.\n\nIn the brief moments before she recognised her son, Ben's mother looked weary, a strained smile on her face. It was clear that she was trying to play the dutiful hostess for whoever had come over. But when she saw her son, the facade dropped - alongside her jaw. She nervously approached, reaching her arm out. \"B...Ben?\" she asked, caressing his cheek. He smiled, feeling tears starting to well up.\n\nIn an instant, her arms wrapped around his torso.

It was a younger man this time - poor old Michael had been killed in the uprising. \"Hello there, what can I get you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ja, I would like to order two pints. On me!\" Adolf said. His accent received a slightly odd stare from the barman, but he went ahead in making the drinks without a word. That had happened once or twice with the other local patrons that night, but neither man had the time or energy to comment on it. As far as Ben was concerned, Adolf was his closest friend, and always would be.\n\nTaking their drinks, they went back to the crowd of former soldiers. Almost all of them had come from this part of the city, and the newcomers were rapidly getting used to the climate. They were all drinking, talking, and swapping war stories. Ben sat down, joining in just as Dickie began an anecdote of what happened when he stole their officer's cap and wore it into battle.\n\nLater that night, the mood would grow more somber, as the men remembered their friends who had not made it.

The land was worth much more than what they were offering in not just monetary value, but memories as well. The fields that his father had taught him to till in, the pastures that he and his wife would stroll through, all of them - blitzed down in favour of an endless concrete expanse.\n\nAs the car trundled back to his home, Giles mentally weighed up how many more months his family would be able to survive off of the money that they had given him - a month or two more, not counting taxes and tariffs, and whatnot. How much more would he have to sell? Why did he bother selling in the first place? He had heard of similar stories from other farmers in the Stoke area, yet he carried on anyway.\n\nArriving back at his farmhouse, Giles dully thanked the driver for dropping him off, and he walked inside.

The crowd looked like how he felt, a torrent of glum, bored-looking locals whose only purpose of attending this little get-together was pure obligation. The clouds above him rolled over each other, casting various shades of dull violet and muted magenta, as if to shield the setting sun from the unworthy eyes of Man.\n\n\"This plant...this coal plant...is living proof that Britain has not only recovered from the savagery of War, but thrived in its absence.\" Domvile studied the faces of his captive audience, not one even attempting to look the least bit enthralled. Fools, the entirety of them. In France, the Petainists would have just sold their people to the Huns for enough change to renovate their mistress' apartments. At least he was doing good work.\n\n\"Ever since the age of Arthur, we have attempted to tame nature for our own purposes. First the humble mill, then the horse and then the Age of Sail. Who could have thought that we could harness the power under our feet for something greater yet?\"\n\nWhat was he saying? Arthur? Did he really think that these - these coal miners - would know anything of Albion? He should have referenced something more earthly, like Punch and Judy or whatever rubbish the radio was putting out in their lurid dramas. He was almost glad that he was going to retire, anything to put some distance from him and this lot.\"\n\nI shall finish this grand renewal of Britain, with a tour of the site itself. Here we will examine just what exactly this monument to our ingenuity lies within, how it works and how it will benefit you, Britain.\"\n\nDomvile leaned away from the podium, just far enough to make sure that the microphone didn't pick up anything he said. He took the hand of an aide of his, clearly as unamused as the rest of the crowd, and walked off, mumbling something."

He couldn't remember the last time he slept, at the very least, the last time he had even rested his eyes. London wanted a large, legacy project. Nobody told him that he had to be the one that set up said project.\n\nThe guest seats lay covered with papers too. Piles of specifications, data and information. Throwing this much money, this much amount of manpower and time and all to come to the conclusion that the barrage they intended to put over the Severn would produce...\n\nMildly positive results.\n\nIt would produce energy, of course. Maybe enough for Domvile to consider the Severn Barrage a success. Perhaps even enough to \"get them in the history books\" as the representative quipped to him during a lunch, whoever knows how many days of tireless work those were ago.\n\nBut it would do too little for the amount of work put in. Maybe he had an engineer's brain, but efficiency was always the point here. If something saved £10 million in energy costs but cost £11 million to maintain, then who gave a toss?\n\nHis secretary came in holding a cream envelope, as haggard as she was. Poor Lizzie, she'd need a break after this. They all did. The moment of truth had arrived, what was the magic number that the government was going to have to conjure from a black hat, like one of Crowley's assistants?

Inconveniently, the German representatives of the bidders had chosen to land in East Anglia rather than somewhere closer to London. They expected the Englishmen to come to them, not vice versa.\n\n\"No, Prime Minister! This is, let's see...\" Maudling snatched a piece of paper from his pocket and unfolded it, squinting. \"British Aerospace wants to make a bid too, sir.\"\n\nBritish Aerospace? That threw a wrench in things. Domvile could not remember the last time that an English company had made a bid on such a large infrastructure project like this, certainly not one as flagship as the Thames Airport. Maybe wrench was the wrong word to use, actually. This was interesting, a showcase on how far the British economy had come.\n\n\"British Aerospace? Why haven't we picked them already?\" Domvile snapped. \"For God's sake, they're the only company from these fair isles that have the gumption to bet against Berlin in the last fifteen years!\"\n\n\"What then, Prime Minister?\" Butler replied, audibly starting to fray at the edges. \"Heinkel and Deutsche Bank have put the largest offer down, by a factor of ten, at least. If we go with our own men, their suits can go up to the Economic Ministry in Berlin and whine that we're not being 'cooperative enough'.\"\n\nThe black, shifting mass in the air grew larger, to the point that the wings of the cargojet were now discernible. Everyone was silent. That's right, it's been fifteen years. Each and every one of them could still remember the bombs over London, Birmingham, Manchester. The insistent sound of gunfire in the night. The endless parade of stretchers holding the dead and dying. As much as they pretend otherwise, Germany would do the same thing again if we stepped out of line. Again and again and again."

There was a mutual disappointment there, sealed by a single shrug from the Prime Minister. Finally, thought Fountaine, he's starting to realise it. The glance broke away quickly, and both men returned to Butler.\n\n\"The Government further pledges that we will revisit and deepen our existing relationships with industry leaders, particularly those from the German corporations, to ensure that prosperity remains an achievable state...\"\n\nButler was cooler than Fountaine expected; he was anticipating a waterfall down the Chancellor's shamed face.

He held his tongue for now, but Domvile hoped that this lot might do something more than bash in the heads of strikers in the near future.\n\n\"Finally, we have achieved what I consider to be our most important yearly goal: we have reduced national employment to 4%.

The Pragmatist's promises and planning for the economy had failed; to him, that much was clear. He spoke of his own ideas, ones that he, Bean and Hamm had shared on long nights in their offices.

Indeed, not only can we not afford to grant pay rises, pay cuts and freezes are an absolute necessity right now in order to balance our spending to some degree. I would suggest countermanding the effects it will have on the people by introducing price controls. We also need to introduce a system of rationing, for which I would suggest modifying the old plans from the war.\"\n\nFountaine struggled to think of something he would disagree with there, and couldn't.

A rural revitalisation initiative will be initiated to restore our precious agriculture and new restrictions upon the foreign megacorporations shall be negotiated, returning to stable and positive GDP growth by the end of the year shall be our measure of success.\"\n\nAs the meeting ended, Chesterton gave a slight nod to Greene from across the table.

He'd been a young man when he'd started, barely old enough to drink when his friends had taken him to watch Mosley speak at Olympia.\n\nHe could still remember the energy in the complex that night, the invincible drive that had made their would-be hecklers run in fear. He smiled, remembering the surprised face of a man he'd punched in the face, pushed down to the ground and kicked over and over. He'd felt so damn strong and so good in that moment, fighting under their Leader. In all the years since then, he'd never recaptured that exact energy. Not until he'd returned today to Olympia with his Blackshirt brothers after so many years, to see a new man standing where Mosley had once stood. The crowd was restless.\n\n\"My friends,\" declared the baritone voice of Jeffrey Hamm, \"I have come here to ask a simple question, one I have dwelled on lately. Why was it that when the time came for our island to be liberated, our leader Mosley was murdered? Why did they kill him then?\"\n\n\"The Jews knew their time was up!\" bellowed a voice in the crowd, met with clapping and roars of agreement. Hamm nodded.\n\n\"Exactly. They were afraid. They knew that our time was coming, and theirs was ending. We are not afraid, though. Come the taunts, the bricks and the beatings, we shall keep marching and they shall not stop us!\"\n\nThe auditorium erupted into cheers, Morris loudest of all. He felt a tear roll down his cheek.

As the BPP is the only legal political party, it is where every up-and-coming bureaucrat, businessman, lawyer, doctor, and aspiring politician throws their lot. Indeed, this tendency of using the party simply to advance one's own career is an issue that the more ideologically-minded amongst the leadership find to be a concerning trend. Nonetheless, as a mass party, winning the support of the membership requires the use of the age-old tactic that can be deployed against any large group with differing ideals - something to unify them. Perhaps at the upcoming BPP conference, an aspiring candidate for future leadership could sway the membership to their side?\n\nThe other, much more difficult group to win the support of is the House of Lords. Whilst the mostly aristocratic upper chamber had started to become politically irrelevant at the beginning of the century, the powers returned to them by the Germans through reversing these reforms made them yet again an important force in British politics. If one lacks the support of the peers, then it is unlikely that he will get very far - their support is needed within any government. This means that to win them over, the prospective candidate must attend to their many needs."

Arguably one of the defining moments of the conference, it is a grandiose and rousing call to action made by the enraptured membership every year. Due to the significance of the event, the position of speaker is an enviable one. Indeed, it leaves the speaker with a great deal of both personal prestige and political capital afterwards. This year, the two main contenders for the position are the two strongmen in party politics - Rab Butler of the Pragmatist faction, and Andrew Fountaine of the ideologues. Whichever of the two makes the speech, their respective faction will surely be empowered. Now, who shall it be?"

Yet as Domvile observed as he read through the suggested speakers for the BPP Conference, this reputation did not seem to have deterred Wilson rise, considering his suggested role in the Conference.\n\nReading on his history, Wilson had seemingly been a Civil servant during the war, serving with great distinction, supposedly writing half of the Beveridge report himself. Even with the invasion, Wilson stayed loyal, becoming a key figure in the reconstruction of the civil service, eventually becoming a MP in the 50s. But even with this work, not much is known on Wilson's own beliefs, beyond his support for Keynesian economics; it is perhaps because of this he has been christened as 'Snake'.\n\nYet as Domvile looked back to the report, he was still conflicted on Wilson's role in the conference. Wilson was an efficient, seemingly loyal public servant, dutifully acting in Britain's best interest, working to help reconstruct Britain from the misery of the 40s. Yet Wilson was unpredictable, mistrusted even by Butler and if we were to promote Wilson just because he's the best person for the job, it would create a lot of resentment throughout the whole of the Civil Service and within the BPP. With all this in mind, and with a tinge of apprehension, Domvile finally decided upon the fate of Wilson."

Yet every time he read a report on Haller-Cooper, head of the illustrious British Free Corps, he couldn't help but curse them for forcing him to deal with antics.\n\nJordan had been in power as long as Domvile had, rising within the BFC due to his ferocity and efficiency in dealing with Stirling's revolts in the 50s. He'd even end up replacing Amery as the head of the BFC, drunkard that he was, after his incompetence at managing the force was revealed. Hell, according to some, it was Jordan's own squad that finally slayed the demonic Stirling, and brought to an end those dark years.\n\nAnd now Jordan still remains one of the most powerful and controversial figures in Britain, to some a proud representative of a strong Aryan, fighting for both the Reich and the United Kingdom. To others, he is a madman, carelessly murdering innocents on his own wild goose chases, he is best summarised as, in the words of one unnamed MP, \"fucking insane\". And to Domvile, he is a massive headache.\n\nHe could be placed as a speaker at the BPP conference, which would be a clear show of recognition for his efforts, or we could reject him, and give a clear repudiation of his methods. We could perhaps allow one of his moderates to represent him for the party, but I suppose it would be difficult, like asking which lunatic should run the asylum.

A law is formed not from any single document but formed over thousands of years of experience.\n\nIt is that tradition that is celebrated today. As Butler delivers his speeches to rapturous applause. Fountaine and his small coterie silently seethe at the sight. They had time to speak of course. But their speeches were only politely given their due attention and applause. Those men didn't even say anything particularly remarkable, only reaffirming the previous beliefs of the \"pragmatists,\" filled with corrupt officials, snakes, and moderates.\n\nAnd yet, evidently. The motley band, in a den of corruption, had struck out the fanatics. Their fiery rhetoric and calls for national renewal fell on deaf ears. And why would they not? Britain was doing remarkably well under Domvile. It is only natural that policy would be outstretched as a continuation of his dealings.

The simmering tensions had finally boiled over, and neither had felt the need to contain themselves to good decorum.\n\nInsults, even a few small objects had flown across the room as speeches degenerated into shouting matches. Butler and Fountaine themselves seemed to contain themselves, just barely, limiting themselves to merely arguments and declarations. But one could barely hear them over the rumbling of arguments.\n\nSome poor men, bless their souls, were simply trying to get the parliament under control. The Speaker of the House of Commons, bless his poor throat, was constantly yelling for \"Order! Order!\" Eventually, they quieted down, if only because the speaker was speaking so loudly that no one could hear themselves speak.\n\nThe conference at least ended quietly. Fountaine and Butler gave back-to-back speeches, to polite applause across the aisle. They were after all one party. One united party.\n\nLord help him if this was what the next few conferences would be. He thought back to the earlier days.

Fountaine speaks to deafening support, as Butler quietly sags, his eyes full of jealousy and resentment. But the revolution had won out over tired old men. It was a natural evolution, why did Butler ever think he could make a message of returning to the old days when it was so clearly evident that this was no longer 1900? No, the people want a revolution, and a revolution is what Fountaine would give them.\n\nOne need only take one look at the world to see why the people would support it. The nations that clung to tired liberalism found themselves conquered, on the back foot, or in an unstable mess. The fascists? These last decades have had the fascist world faced with constant challenges, and yet the world order was undoubtedly that of the new order. The Germans, Italians and Japanese had done within decades what Marxists could not achieve in centuries. The choice was obvious and simple as could be.\n\nFountaine spoke with finality and pride \"The past century has been hard on every one of us, but it was not the end of us. And as we survived, we rebuilt and purged the weakness of our society! I thank you all, and swear to every British man, the best is yet to come!\"\n\nThe corrupt den of snakes and reformists could only look on as the room applauded."

The House of Lords needs a good cleaning, and you'll be the one holding the duster.\"\n\nAt this, Wallop couldn't help but smirk. Finally, those pencil-pushers in the Commons had at least realised the mortal peril the House of Lords - and by extension, all of Britain - was in. The corrupt sycophants who let Abs and his ilk pillage their land for mere bribes. The apathetic disgraces who shamed their ancestors by not even bothering to turn up. The flagging spirit of those who were supposed to be defending Britain from the Judeo-Bolshevik menace. It was disgraceful, truly, but not unsalvageable.\n\n\"Thank you, Prime Minister. Rest assured, I'll get the Upper House back into shape soon enough.\" Replied Wallop, drawing a relieved nod from Domvile. But the strained look on his face did not leave, even as he tipped back a glass of freshly poured whiskey.\n\n\"Good, good. See if you can't clip the wings of that upstart Fountaine and that weasel Butler whilst you're at it. The BPP is our Party Gerard, ours.

It was all too fitting then, that when he needed advice on the troubled state of Britain, he could turn to the same friend who had hosted him here so often. As the car pulled into a small estate at Springhead, he couldn't help but smile a little at the familiar face waiting outside to greet him.\n\n\"Gerard!\" Gardiner cried with delight, giving his hand a firm shake. \"Please, come in, Marabel will be overjoyed to see you. How have you been, old bean? I hope London hasn't been treating you too poorly?\"\n\nWallop chuckled, \"As well as it can, with the company one's forced to keep there.\" His face turned serious, \"Though it certainly seems they've treated the country poorly. To tell the truth, I came here as much for your advice as anything.\"\n\nHis friend nodded, suddenly sobered. \"I was hoping you'd say so. You must have seen Fontmell Magna as you drove in?\" Wallop nodded. \"Half the houses are in disrepair, London's completely forgotten parishes like it in favor of urban cities. Sometimes, Gerard I feel like you're the only one there who truly cares and focuses on the right things.\"\n\n\"Such as Douglas's theories?\" Gardiner had always been passionate about the subject, recalled the Earl and in truth Social Credit had made a great deal of sense to him as well. Had it been practical, he might have pushed for it further, but with Arthur's downfall the time had never seemed quite right.\n\n\"It's the only way, old friend,\" insisted Gardiner, fervently. \"You believed that once more than anyone.

Even as he was confronted by numerous workplace safety violations that would make a foreman in Guangdong blush, Shaw did not mark his form.\n\nOf course, thought Brunke, this was just a fundraising drive.

There would be a few days of wining and dining with the German elite, and then it would be business. Briefly looking back out at the increasingly dark city, he suppressed a shudder. Hopefully this feeling was not a portent of things to come."

Undoubtedly one of history's great men, on the few occasions Domvile had previously personally spoken to the Führer, his keen intellect and sharp wit had shone through with every word he said. Truthfully, it was almost captivating to see him speak.\n\nIf Domvile had not been told that the shrivelled old man in front of him was Hitler himself, he would not have believed it.\n\n\"Ah, Herr Lloyd George,\" he had said, upon entering the meeting room and walking over to shake Domvile's hand. \"How pleasant to see you again, it has been rather too long.\" Domvile had only half-heartedly corrected him before the conversation moved swiftly onwards.\n\nMatters did not improve as the meeting went on. At several points, he seemed to space out entirely, having to be dragged back to reality by Domvile. It all got too much, eventually, and his personal guard barged in and hurried the Führer away. As they left, Hitler turned around and looked at Domvile, saying only one thing."

Nonetheless, I understand that your discussion could not be fully completed. Therefore, I am here to continue the discussion in his stead. Is this clear?\"\n\nDomvile briefly mused as to whether Hitler had specifically requested that it was to be Bormann who met with him, or whether he simply decided that it was to be. \"That will be fine, yes, thank you,\" he said, putting down his cup.

He thanked his lucky stars that he wasn't one of the poor sods down in the mines, at least. But the work was still mind-numbing, tedious, and long. So, so long. He barely had time to sustain himself beyond a light breakfast in the morning and a light dinner when he got home at night. The rest of his free time was spent sleeping. The factory was full of men like him. English, working class, born and bred in London with nowhere else to go. So they all just got on with it and accepted whatever the Germans told them to do.\n\nAcross the room, a sharp and angry voice could be heard. It was Herr Funk, the pudgy, balding overseer. He was scolding one of the younger lads for cocking up the assembly. Ernie felt the hatred he had for the Krauts bubbling up to the service. They were all like that. Unforgiving, uncaring, and harsh for no reason. And yet, they all got to drive around in fancy cars and wear nice suits, while Ernie and the other workers got feck-all. His wages hadn't changed in the five years he'd been working there. Old Bill, who'd been there longest, had said once that the last time he had a raise was 1954. It was all just such a crap situation. But what could someone like him do about it?\n\nAfter clocking out of his shift at 9:30PM, he was approached by a man he'd never seen around the factory before. He said he used to work there, before he left and joined a new business. He then went and said aloud EVERYTHING that Ernie had been thinking that day - about the hours, the pay, the Germans, the lot. The mystery man then gave Ernie a leaflet, telling him to come to a meeting he and his mates had at the pub every week. As the man walked off into the night, Ernie looked closer at the pamphlet, which had an all too familiar phrase emblazoned at the top."

The economy, thanks to the many years of hard work put in by Britain and her people, has finally begun the process of recovering from the disastrous crash of the 1950s. We are beginning to see some growth and an increase in trade with the Reich and her other partner states. We have received offers of particular excitement from Krupp and Volkswagen, who have offered to set up at least 20 more manufacturing plants across the country each. This will invigorate the job market, bringing further growth and lowering unemployment.\n\nUnfortunately, with the good comes the bad. Whilst Resistance activity has declined drastically from what it once was, they still plague the countryside and the innermost areas of the city. Attacks upon public works projects have increased by three times as much from last year, localised particularly around the West Midlands and the North. In addition, these new investments from the German conglomerates have tethered our economy ever closer to that of the Reich. Whilst there are some amongst us who see no issue with this, it places our newfound \"stability\" at risk, should the Reich face any internal issues."

Now waiting for the leaders to arrive, he remained cautious. He had a better view of the unions than most of the BPP, though that didn't say much, considering his opposition were those who wanted to ban them and others who wanted to shoot them. He tolerated them, even liking a few of the leaders, but ever since the war, he never could look at them without being reminded of their revolutionary elements, those who wanted to shoot him and stick his head on London Bridge.\n\nRegardless, he still acted as the best connection the cabinet had to the unions, and if this meeting got him closer to N10, so be it. Five men entered his office, all clearly from working-class backgrounds, their faces aged visibly past their years, and their suits tight and ill-fitting. And their eyes, Butler looked into them and saw mistrust, well he'd expected that, but in one he saw visible, burning hatred. He had predicted they would mistrust him, but that kind of hatred was unexpected. Maybe that man was a member of the resistance, barely holding himself back from shooting Butler there and then, or maybe another benign reason. He supposed it didn't matter, and with visible tension, the discussion started.\n\nThe discussions went on for an hour, Wilson sliding in whenever it was clear an argument may erupt. In the end, Butler agreed to work on legislation to improve pay and working conditions in the factory and to negotiate with the companies on their behalf. As they exited the room, giving crocodile smiles, he feared that all this discussion was pointless, that they would turn on him the moment an opportunity presented itself.

Domvile could see why the ideologue was so fond of Bean. Sitting across from him, the man babbled at a mile-a-minute, producing paper after paper extolling the virtues of \"nationalistic\" trade unions - if such a thing were even possible, Domvile was unsure.\n\nThe Prime Minister held up his hand, signaling for Bean to momentarily quieten himself. \"So, if I mean to understand all this correctly, you're proposing that we... nationalize the unions?\"\n\nBean nodded. \"Yes,\" he said as if it were the simplest thing in the world. Domvile's eyebrow was raised sharply. \"But as I have said, these won't be the cowardly, selfish unions we know today. No, these will be patriotic collectives of workers who all work towards the common good of the nation,\" Bean explained. \"Their grievances shall be honest and their needs shall be few. After all, what better way to defeat Judeo-Bolshevism than to purify its ideals?\n\nBean went on for a few more minutes before Domvile found himself unable to take any more. \"Mr. Bean... your ideas... shall be considered. Thank you for your time.\" Bean's eyes lit up with glee, and he thanked the Prime Minister profusely, before leaving his office. As soon as the door shut, Domvile sighed heavily. This was Fountaine's best man? He would have made an excellent writer, certainly, but governing was more than a manifesto. And yet... Fountaine trusted him.

Born in Imperial Russia, he was only a child when Poland was finally liberated, a free nation once more after 100 years of tyranny. But that freedom was short-lived, a flicker of hope in centuries of misery. By the time, he was old enough to enjoy the freedom of his nation, he was sent to war, fighting a desperate defence against the Germans. It was all for nought, and Poland fell once more.\n\nFrom there, his life remained static, working in a concentration camp for 20 years, upon the ashes of his former country. Day after day, he performed backbreaking work, constructing the weapons that would be used to terrorise his people. Today was no different, except the parts were seemingly a different make than usual, he took a closer look at the label, seeing a foreign label, but it was familiar to him. Then it dawned on him: it was a British label on the product, something he had not seen since he was a minor Polish Soldier.\n\nHe had remembered hearing about the fall of Britain through desperately listening to the muffled discussion between the guards. While he was distraught by the news, he had hope. Britain would not go quietly, the population would not surrender, and they would fight on, never giving the Germans the satisfaction of a victory. Yet there was a British label in the Camp. Britain, who had stood up for Polish independence when Nazi domination seemed certain, was now trading freely with the Reich.

But it was better than just sitting around all day. Madge had just finished telling him about how his second granddaughter had just gotten engaged to a nice lad from Liverpool when Bill heard a loud voice echoing from the town square.\n\n\"Young lads of Britain! Are you tired of your average lives? Would you like to serve your country? Then come on over 'ere and sign on up to the British army! We want you!\" A middle-aged man with greying dark hair and a pencil-thin mustache was handing out leaflets emblazoned with what looked to be a bastardized version of Lord Kitchener in a German army uniform. Beside him sat a rather severe-looking man at a table, who was taking down the names of what Bill found to be the most offensive part of the display - a queue of young men who were cluelessly signing up.\n\nMadge, who had long since known when to pick up on her father's mannerisms, swiftly moved to try and assuage him. \"Dad, come on. It's not worth getting all worked up about.\n\n\"Bill scoffed. \"I'll feel however I bloody well please, Madge. Bloody disgraceful. Don't them lads know who they're really signing up to fight for?\" She rolled her eyes.\n\n\"You were in the army for both wars, there's no point getting all angry about it.\" Bill felt his wizened fists clench.\n\n\"I was alright!

Haller-Cooper, based on information gathered by agents in the Glasgow area, launched a raid on the so-called \"sons of Wallace\" rebel group, burning their hideout to the ground and seemingly murdering their inhabitants. This fire would later spread, burning down a restaurant nearby. While the resistance cell is dead, we are no closer to finding if they were acting independently or part of the larger origination. Activities like these, and his continual collateral damage, led me to suggest once more to reduce Jordan's role in dealing with resistance activity.\n\nUpon finishing reading the report summary, Domvile looked up to Knight, \"Maxwell, I've read this kind of report a hundred times before, you know we can't get rid of Jordan.

This would be a glorious victory for the fatherland and for their friends in Britain. Yet, the young man could not help but be filled with dread as they approached the docks under the cover of darkness. The men next to him were clearly bothered as well, glancing from side to side at every minor noise. Something was wrong, they could sense it. All of a sudden, their commanding officer held up his hand. \"Schnell!\" he whispered harshly, commanding them to stop. For a moment, all was still.\n\nAnd then, from the shadows, a Zhdanov cocktail came flying, killing at least 4 men.\n\nAs if they had been hiding in the dingy street itself, several armed men bedecked with various weapons and clothing painted with Communist symbols emerged, leaping upon the German force like a venus flytrap. The sounds of gunfire filled the night, as the discombobulated Germans desperately tried to fight back. Hans could only watch as his comrades were beaten, knocked out, and gunned down in front of him. This wasn't supposed to be how that night went. They were the German army, the greatest military force in the world, the heroes of the Aryan race that were destined for greatness. And here they were, being slaughtered like pigs by mere partisans. He had to leave. He needed to report back to the garrison, so they could arrive with reinforcements. Desperately trying to ignore the cries of his fellow soldiers as they screamed for help, Hans ran back in the direction they had came.\n\nBut before his mind could muster anything other than senseless fear, a sharp, splitting pain travelled through his head, knocking the soldier to the floor. \"And where d'you think you're goin', ey lad?\" a voice shouted at him from above. Fuzzily, Hans could make out the outline of a well-built man who was holding a large, blunt pipe. His vision cleared somewhat, and suddenly he could make the figure out - it was Jack Jones, leader of the Left Resistance. The man crouched down and looked the soldier in the eyes. \"I'm not sure how much English you speak, so I'm gonna keep it simple. I've been fighting Fash bastards before you Germans even entered Britain. We fought you then, an' we'll fight you again.

Yet, the Union Jack patches on their uniform signified something other, something perhaps worse; they were the British Free Corps, an extension of Germany's hand on the Isles, and staffed by the worst traitors and fascists Britain could offer.

The Party had faced instability before, but never on this scale. He shakily picked up the reports and kept looking through them. The one unifying factor that ran through them all was that the Twins always knew where and when the troops were coming. Jones ambushing patrols.

As a way to distract themselves from the cold that had them all shaking in their boots, Michael got to talking with his co-pilot Sam, as he often did. \n\n\"We were really bloody unprepared for this, you know. I mean, my mother almost froze to death in her home last week, barely survived, she did. The government my Ma grew up in wouldn't have been this poorly prepared.\" He shook his head.\n\n\"Hell, maybe it's just this government,\" Sam said. \"They've been blundering from one crisis to the next, even I could run Britain better than those smug lords. Maybe your Ma was right, maybe we do need...\" \n\nAn explosion ripped across the Northumbrian sky, as the remains of a helicopter crashed down into a nearby field. After a short and swift investigation, the resistance was found to be guilty of the crime. Another government spokesperson quickly denounced the crime, arguing that only with the strong hand of the BPP could order be restored to Britain and keep it safe from threats such as these."

In a worst-case scenario, whole villages could freeze to death as the heating fails.\"\n\n\"We need to move quickly and mobilise our workers to increase energy output,\" suggested Fountaine, drawing approval from many of those assembled. \"With proper motivation, our miners should be able to temporarily increase our coal reserves enough that we can meet the increased demand.\"\n\n\"For once I agree with you Andrew.\" Said Butler, surprising his rival. \"However, we should look to see if our German friends can't help us through this crisis as well. We are in a 'Unity' Pakt after all, they can't exactly refuse to help an ally in need.\"\n\nOver the next few hours, an emergency response plan was drawn up and sent out to the relevant ministries to implement as a priority. Whilst pleased to see the cabinet working together for once, Domvile knew this was only the beginning of what was needed to counteract the potential crisis before it became a real one. There was something else though, something that unsettled him as he lay in bed that night.\n\nWas this merely a bad start to the year? Or a sign of things to come?"

Being a coal miner was in his blood, a proud family tradition of the Clives since his great-grandfather first took up a pickaxe with several hundred other men and began to burrow deep into the earth in search of the fuel that would soon power all of the rising British Empire.\n\nHe too had felt a rush of pride when he too took up a pick for the first time, all those years ago in 1940. He wasn't just mining for a paycheck at the end of the day, but for the whole country, to keep the lights on in their darkest hour. But now he felt only a trace of that pride. The old unions had been obliterated in a matter of months, he was soon told that he'd be working for Reichswerke from now on, and then the briefest glimmer of hope was crushed under the garrison's jackboot. So when he was called in once again to work hours of overtime \"For the country\" he felt but one thing. Anger.\n\nNot that he was helping avoid an energy crisis and saving hundreds of lives, that he was quite proud of and was the only reason he hadn't handed in his resignation already. What made him angry was that if the gaggle of spineless traitors in Westminster spent more time finding solutions to the problems their collaboration caused than shining German boots, they might not be in this mess at all, and he could be at home instead of slogging it out in the mines.\n\nAs Peter collapsed into his bed that night, exhausted, the anger refused to cool. He'd be back on another double shift tomorrow, paying the price for Domvile's ineptitude. He knew most of his fellow miners felt the same way, he'd heard it in their voices and seen it in their eyes. The collaborators might have dodged this crisis through his own hard labour, but something far, far more devastating was brewing in the hearts and minds of people across the country."

 domvile.75.d:0 "This is a public service broadcast regarding the practice of coal hoarding, and what YOU can do to stop it in your community. Observe in the graph to the right, the average recorded winter temperatures in Britain from the year 1800 to the present. Temperatures such as the current year's can lead to rapid hypothermia if not insulated, which unless dealt with promptly, will lead to slurred speech, confusion, organ failure and unconsciousness, followed by death.\n\nHypothermia occurs when the body loses the heat it needs to regulate itself, and is caused by prolonged exposure to extremely cold temperatures. To prevent hypothermia in your community, it is critical that your community maintain its local supply of government issued coal, and that your family obtains its regular ration as issued by your community's local council. To ensure a steady supply of government coal for all families, citizens are advised to keep watch for coal hoarders.\n\nWhat is a coal hoarder? A coal hoarder is an individual in your community who, by theft or bribery, attempts to solicit coal not assigned to them, either for themselves or to provide to terror cells operating in cold locations. Coal hoarders and coal thieves operate by taking coal from your community directly, and can be conclusively traced back to the decrease of coal rations in several communities.\n\nWhat can you do to stop coal hoarders? Coal hoarders should not be confronted directly, as a number have been linked to terrorist activity. To keep YOUR community safe, YOU can do the following.\n\n1) Report homes heated in regions deemed non-critical by the government. If there are homes in your neighborhood heated despite non-critical conditions, it is likely that home is being heated with stolen coal.\n\n2) Take only your allotted ration of coal. Coal theft is a criminal offense, and will be met with the harshest legal penalties.\n\n3) Report suspected coal hoarders to your local law enforcement or constable. Only with YOUR help can they identify coal hoarders and stop them from hurting your community."

To Domvile, Hitler may not have been perfect, but he was the saviour of Europe and the liberator of Britain. And once sorrow faded, fears crept in; without him, what was to become of the Reich, what was to become of Britannia?\n\nTo Fountaine, the news was deeply sorrowful, for one of Humanity's greatest minds was lost to us. Hitler had liberated Europe and allowed the greatest members of British society to rise unrestricted by old morals. Yet beyond this, Fountaine was more concerned for Britain itself, without its great benefactor, what was to become of the BPP and Britain. How was the new order able to survive without its greatest champion?\n\nFor Wallop and all the great lords of the BPP, the news brought upon them fear, overwhelming fear for their future. For though their opinions on Hitler varied, and their support for National Socialism was minimal, Hitler had brought one thing back for them, Power, Power over the great masses of Britain. Without Hitler's eternal support, the death of Hitler may not just be a death blow for the Reich, but old dynasties of Britain as well.\n\nAnd Butler?

Following further discussions on the nature of cooperation between British and German forces, it was eventually decided that the German Garrison should be temporarily integrated within the British high command in order to ensure a coercive, efficient military.

 ENG_DOM.2.desc:0 "For many British workers, the end of the Blitz had only ushered in a new era of hardships. While German planes no longer rained hell down upon their homes and businesses every night, a more silent, invisible enemy had taken their place. The spectre of hunger and poverty crept across the nation, as the government floundered in its efforts to rebuild the country, too wrapped up in its own internal squabbles and arguments to care.\n\nIn an environment like this, small business suffered, and the greengrocery owned by one Alfred Roberts was no exception. A local alderman with a happy family, his business was affected just as much by the post-war devastation. However, they had still fared better than most had, managing to continue living comfortably. With this in mind, it would thus come as a genuine shock to anyone who knew the family that Roberts' daughter Margaret had been helping the resistance by making bombs for the last five years.\n\nShe had initially done so out of spite. As a woman of ambition stifled by the lack of social mobility provided by the government, she felt it proper to put her unused chemistry knowledge towards a cause that would chip away at the establishment that kept her there. But after having met with local resistance members on and off for the past half a decade, Roberts had slowly began to sympathise with their cause. It was a perfect relationship - nobody would suspect her as the resistance grew in size and strength.\n\nIt was a rainy Thusday morning when she dropped her last package off. She deposited a large parcel wrapped in brown paper at her usual deposit point, before walking away again, acting as if nothing had happened. Little did Margaret Roberts know that she had just set in motion a series of events that would change Britain - perhaps forever."

Alas, that all but a memory now, the London stock exchange crashed and burnt with the rest of the empire, the building scorched by the blitz and decimated by the German invasion.\n\nAnd now, 20 years later, the exchange falls once again, not because of any resistance bomb or German rocket, but as the British economy falls once more, pulled down by the German Eagle. With the chaos of the German succession crisis, the Mega Corporations that control so much of the once dominating British economy have been forced to pull out, with fears over future conflicts within both British and the rest of the Reich's empire.\n\nWith this, the London stock market has fallen into chaos, stockholders seeking fruitlessly to sell their stocks for whatever price available. All hoping, begging that the meagre funds they get from this is enough to save them from bankruptcy.

Despite all this, in his 10 years at working there, Harold could not remember a day when he'd see the street void of all bystanders.\n\nOn approaching the building, he first noticed that most of the building was boarded up, its windows covered in steel and wood. The main door had a barricade set up around it, hastily built of tables and chairs from within the building, barbed wire dotted around it. The strange thing was however that the barricade at the front was seeming half done, with a human sized hole offering an entrance into the building, which Harold, with some depredation, moved into the building through.\n\nInside, Harold found the building in a delperated state, chairs and tables dotted around the room in various states of disrepair. Papers were strewn about, a few evidently torn up while most were just left on the floor or desks. Yet the most notable and out of place sight in the large room was the rather large number of men and women, their weapons a mismatch of German, American and even old British rifles from the war. As Harold stepped closer, he was noticed, as more and more heads turned to face him; the youngest one, who couldn't be more than 16, put their old battered gun on him, seemingly anxious to shoot.

Our so-called 'overlord' has abandoned their fascist pawns in Westminster, and now more than ever is the time to call for their annihilation.\"\n\nDeep within a bunker in a Lancastrian hillside, three men sat before a microphone broadcasting their final manifesto to those across Britain.

For years however, I have also led Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance.\"\n\n\"I'm sure those amongst you remember Cable Street. In 1956 when our brightest hopes were dashed by the clubs of Germans. I ask you to remember that day, but not to despair on it. Alexander and Stirling gave their lives for our cause that day, and out of it we moved to cover our resistance in the shadows.

 mann.1.d:0 "\"You know what I see when I look over these hangers?\" Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Hawkins asked his assistant as he surveyed the grounds of the aging Royal Air Force base which he had been placed in charge of. \"Its heyday is long gone. Back in the 30s and 40s it was a key defense of the British isles; the linchpin of the Irish Sea. Yet now it has been left to decay. The bigwigs in Westminster don't consider renovating the base a high priority, and most folks who sign up for the RAF consider an assignment to this small island as a sentencing to mediocrity. Nobody makes a name at this base.\"\n\n\"S-sir... do you think we ought to surrender?\" His assistant asked, the smaller man readjusting his uniform which was just a tad too large for his thinner frame. \"We could destroy the base, and prevent HMMLR forces from getting their hands on our weapons and planes.\"\n\nHawkins shook his head immediately at the suggestion. \"No,\" He said firmly, once more looking over the hangers. \"We may be isolated from our forces, surrounded on the coast with the threat of HMMLR attacks, but I will not surrender this base to them unless it's over my cold, decaying corpse. They will have to bomb this island into the stone age if they want it.\"\n\n\"Get out a notepad,\" Hawkins ordered. Once he saw his assistant holding his pen just above the top of his notepad, he started. \"I want a drill before any HMMLR forces decide to attack; get the men ready to defend the island at a moment's notice. I want forces stationed on all major overlooks facing towards the mainland. We'll need bunkers to defend the beaches. And I want an inspection of our armory. I don't want any of our weapons breaking when we need them. I want this base to be as ready for war as it was in the 1930s.\"\n\nHawkins gave another glance over his base and its hangers. If they could save the forces on the mainland just one hour of attacks by distracting HMMLR forces with an invasion of their island, then that would be enough. Anything to protect civilization in Britain."

 mann.2.t:0 "The Fall of Mann"
 mann.2.d:0 "Hawkins stared out over the grey waters of the Irish Sea with a look he had not worn since the fall of Britain itself. He had been ordered to hold Mann, but when those fucking traitorous dogs sent what was in effect nothing more than a probe, his men broke. The Resistance had run rampart over the island, and he'd been forced to withdraw with his tail between his legs for the second time in his life.\n\n\"Sir, London's on the line.\" His adjunct said holding out a radio with a tremble. Hawkins smiled at the young man and grabbed the radio with a grimace. \"Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Hawkins, Commanding Officer of the Mann Force.\" \"Lieutenant Colonel, what in God's name happened to Mann. How could you let a bunch of up jumped Jews, and Bolsheviks take Mann. You outnumbered, them. How did Mann fall?\" The last part was practically a snarl.\n\nHawkins looked around the carrier, staring at the battered, broken troops withdrawing as he tried to think up an answer. \"The Resistance were more motivated then my men, and they were lucky. They came ashore at an undefended part of the island, and fought hard. The luckiest part of this operation was the evacuation.\" \"I see, very well Major, when you reach London, report to the Anglian Front.\"\n\nMajor Kenneth Hawkins put down the radio and stared out over the Irish Sea once again. The pistol at his side was heavy as he grabbed it and raised it to his head."

 mann.3.t:0 "O'er the Main"
 mann.3.d:0 "Hawkins stared out over the grey waters of the Irish Sea with a glower. The defeat on Mann had been a disappointing. The Resistance's forces had stormed the centre of the island, cutting his men in two, and now here he was glowering on a ship fleeing to Bristol. His men had fought well though. They had done their best against the odds, but a lack of resources, and the bad strategic situation they'd been placed in had broken them.\n\nThe evacuation of the southern pocket however was a victory no two ways of looking at it. The men around Hawkins had fought for the Government on Mann they'd fight for the Government on the mainland. That was enough of a victory for him.\n\n\"Sir, orders from London. We're being reassigned to the East Anglia front.\" His adjunct barked from behind him the Manx brogue in his voice reminding Hawkins of how he'd been recruited from the few civilians loyal to His Majesties Government as they withdrew.\n\n\"Very well. Inform the men, we're going back to war, and tell them that London is proud of them.\""

 mann.4.t:0 "Drying Soil"
 mann.4.d:0 "Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Hawkins and the men remaining in the battalion all stood within the underside of a German destroyer retreating back to the Port of Bristol. While still anxious from the evacuation of the Isle, he held his head in shame. It was only natural for him to do so after such a humbling defeat. The pride and confidence in his men alone was enough to shatter his soul to see them succumbing to the HMMLR.\n\nHe had not tracked the time while on the ship, so he was shocked to hear the slipway slam against the cold docks of the mainland. Once he had heard the slipway, another thought entered his mind that eventually overwhelmed him. What did the Government think? After a few minutes of pacing alone, one of his soldiers called him up to the main deck. He sighed deeply and hoped for the best. Awaiting before him was General Edmund Bacon, one of London's most politically connected officers. He formally greeted the general and after a moment of quiet, the General expressed his sorrows.\n\n\"Sir, God bless you and your men for what you faced on that isle. You know I probably couldn't have done better myself. Not to offend however with better coordination between your position and ours, we could've maybe crushed them before they ever crossed the sights of even a sniper. But that's just wishful thinking.\"\n\nGeneral Bacon looked over to see Colonel Hawkins gazing aimlessly at the surrounding port. He scratched the bottom of his chin and tried to help out the seemingly depressed Hawkins.\n\n\"If you're thinking that London's wanting to exile you, you're mistaken my friend. I talked to the Prime Minister not even ten minutes ago and he told me that the resistance you and your men against the HMMLR was spectacular by itself. And as a General myself, I can tell you that with the amount of time spent on that isle, they won't be reaping the rewards of their victory until they're all six-feet under.\""
 mann.4.a:0 "Their fruits of victory were always faded."

 mann.5.t:0 "The Wall Holds"
 mann.5.d:0 "The sky was as grey as sin, Hawkins noted. He stood outside the base, expecting to hear the familiar trundling of wheels on hard earth any moment now. Part of him was still mentally occupied with how dire the situation seemed to be on the mainland. Apparently the resistance had been upping attacks as of late, with a small force being sighted further south. A patrol had been sent to deal with them, but he had heard nothing back yet. Hawkins' fears were assuaged, however, when he spotted a familiar armed truck trundling towards him in the distance.\n\nIt came to a stop directly parallel to him, as what looked to be the entire patrol filled out and stood to attention. \"At ease,\" he said, saluting them. \"How went the mission, men?\" He already knew the answer. Their faces were relaxed and their expressions light. He had faintly heard the sound of jaunty banter coming from within the truck before they had came out of it. It had gone well.\n\nJenkins stepped forward. \"You'll be happy to know it was a great success, sir. All 3 boats were sunk, and any of the blighters that made it to land were dealt with. No casualties on our side.\" he said, not without a satisfied smirk. Hawkins had half a mind to discipline him, but he couldn't. Everyone on the Isle needed a win where they could get one.\n\nHe nodded, grinning back lightly. \"Jolly good. You are all dismissed for the day, then. Good work.\" The troops cheered, making their way into the base to presumably tuck into their rations for the night. Once they were gone, he sighed. That was another day they held out. He dabbed his forehead with a handkerchief, before looking back out at the skyline. How many more perfect victories would they get?"
 mann.5.a:0 "Safe - for now, at least."
 mann.6.t:0 "Probing the Island"
 mann.6.d:0 "The final plane landed on the runway, its roaring engine slowly grinding to a halt as the pilot taxied his way over towards the waiting base commander. Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins grinned ear to ear as he approached the plane, looking towards the young pilot by the name of George O'Connor sitting in the cockpit and yanking off his helmet. Only five planes unaccounted for.\n\n\"We did it, sir!\" George O'Connor shouted, barely able to contain the adrenaline rushing through him and returning the Colonel's wide grin. \"Those HMMLR planes didn't know what they were dealing with. We spun circles around them, and once we got in behind them... wham! Shoot them right out of the sky. We lost a plane for every twenty of theirs I bet you, and they couldn't do anything about it. I even saw some rushing back towards the mainland with their tails curled behind their back, hoping we wouldn't follow!\" Hawkins couldn't be prouder of his pilots. He jabbed his finger into the cockpit, pointing towards George as he explained, \"You've defended this island from that pitiful probing attack like true warriors of the most glorious nation on Earth. The vagabonds and criminals that HMMLR is recruiting will be no match for us. Now go on, celebrate with the others! I'll be along shortly.\" George saluted his base commander, then taxied his way down towards the hanger on the far end of the runway. Hawkins watched him go, unable to shake the newfound confidence that filled him. They had held off the HMMLR forces in such a crushing victory that it made one wonder whether his prophesied final defence may have been presumptive. Perhaps they weren't facing the inevitable last stand against barbarism. They may even survive this war.\n\n\"Send us your worst,\" Kenneth Hawkins muttered to himself, \"and we'll send them back in body bags.\""
 mann.6.a:0 "The island survives the opening silo."
 mann.7.t:0 "Winding Down"
 mann.7.d:0 "Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Hawkins watched the shores of the isle with great anticipation. As the hours passed, he had found the beaches of Laxey to be quieting. He had been waiting for any HMMLR pontoon boats to arrive. Yet none had in hours. He let the anxious and curious side get to him, leaving the bunker to watch the Irish Sea with a pair of binoculars. Hawkins usually never left the bunker for a day if not several under the normal circumstances of the HMMLR's invasion. Now however, the skies have been clearing for His Majesty's control over the isle.\n\nColonel Hawkins managed to spot a half-a-dozen boats cruising towards the isle. As far as he could tell, none of them had backup and the boats were very small compared to the ones they had faced before, possibly even civilian sized. Hawkins examined the men approaching the shore of Laxey. He did not directly observe them however he did observe the weapons they were to soon fight with. They were not the average M14's they have usually seen but a rusted variant of StG-45.\n\n\"God, has the HMMLR gotten this desperate to take the isle?\", he pondered to himself. \"If they are struggling this hard here, I would hate to see the blood baths on the mainland.\" Hawkins quickly dropped the binoculars to rally his men.\n\n\"Men, I hope to talk to you for the final time stationed on this isle. Get into position and prepare for the half-a-dozen boats coming towards our position. Win this, and hopefully we won't see another HMMLR flag crossing the sea.\"\n\nOne of the younger officers spoke up to question Hawkins, \"Are you sure this is the last time they'll come, Colonel?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am sure of it. If I'm wrong, I owe all of you 40 pounds. We've clearly exhausted them. And they are showing their exhaustion.\""
 mann.7.a:0 "The officer turned back to the iron sights of his rifle, ready for anything."
 mann.8.t:0 "Red Shores"
 mann.8.d:0 "RAF Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Hawkins peered into his binoculars, holding onto the roof of his staff car for balance as he scanned the wide, open approaches to the Isle.\n\n\"Do you reckon there's survivors left, Lieutenant?\" Asked the officer, sitting passenger-side to the weary commander.\n\n\"No. Not after that. I haven't seen anything like this since Dover.\" He mumbled back, removing the lenses from his eyes.\n\nOn the beaches below laid a sight unseen since Sealion. Hundreds of bodies strewn out across the sand, illuminated only by the burning ships, ran ashore alongside them. Thick plumes of smoke rose from the island's interior settlements, shelled haphazardly by naval guns and mortars. Rebel units that could make it past the beaches fought to the last man against a mix of conscripted infantrymen and irregular militia forces, desperately holding the line against wave after wave of front attacks, exhausting their scarce supply of shells repelling each bloody attempt.\n\nWhen all was said and done, no Free British rose their flag above Douglas that day. Held back just barely on the wire.\n\n\"Lieutenant, another truck of wounded has arrived! I heard the officers wanted to speak with you in person. Something about an evacuation!\" Shouted a voice from another car.\n\nHawkins turned his head, squinting his eyes in confusion.\n\n"

She had blurry memories of having been asked to do a few hours in the factory making bombs and bullets when she was 18. It had been hard, but it made her feel like she was actually doing something to help her country, rather than sitting on her arse all day doing nothing. But then they lost the war, and it was back home for Brenda.\n\n...until a man came to the doorstep of her house a few nights ago and said she was due to start \"doing her bit\" for the nation by working in that same factory.\n\nWhich was how, twenty years later, she found herself back next to a conveyor belt, putting bullets together and assembling shells. The clothes she had been given were already covered in grease, soot, and all the other unpleasant things that coated almost every surface in the factory. She was filthy, sweating, and had never been under such pressure to produce results this quickly before.\n\nAnd yet, Brenda was loving every minute of it. The feeling of being useful, of working both for her country and herself was... liberating. If this could happen again after twenty years, then who was to say what would happen for other women in the next twenty?"

Everything felt muted. Nall-Cain himself remembered mumbling out the customary words, swearing to serve in his best capacity as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Rab Butler was shaking like a leaf - he had been one of the first at the scene of Domvile's fiery grave. Andrew Fountaine kept a stoney expression, staring into the distance as if deep in thought when not being spoken to.\n\nWhen he had finished swearing his oaths, simply nodded. \"Thank you gentlemen. I am aware that I have arrived at a critical time if we wish to save Britain from Bolshevism. I am sure that we will all strive to crush these upstarts forthwith.\" He nodded once again, and, having made his somewhat lacklustre speech, shuffled off to another room to be briefed. This left Butler and Fountaine alone in a room together.\n\nFor a few moments the two men were silent. Then, Butler spoke up. \"...how has it come to this?\" He asked. Fountaine was silent. Butler coughed, snapping him out of his reverie. \"Has it come to what?\" He asked, rather snappily. \"To the point where you and I are going to have to put aside our differences to keep the nation running.\" Fountaine scoffed. \"You aren't immediately jumping ship to join your fellow democracy-loving traitors in the resistance? I'm surprised.\"\n\nButler repressed the urge to spit on the man. \"Well yes, oddly enough. I detest the radicals who put our nation in danger as much as you. And if we want Britain to come out of this with a modicum of stability, we cannot let petty ideology get in the way.\" Fountaine hummed, and nodded."

He had gently moseyed his way on down to the police station that morning as he usually did, idly greeting Mrs. Poggitt along the way. She asked about his family, he asked about hers, they parted. But when he reached the police station, the young officer was met with the sight of Constable Coombes frantically hammering planks of wood over the windows.\n\nThe other man looked over his shoulder, a wild look flashing across his face before he became visibly relieved upon recognising Jeffries. \"Thank god you're here, lad, get in. Go on!\" He said. When Jeffries didn't budge, his face grew visibly stormy. \"I said get the hell inside!\" He yelled, violently gesticulating towards the door. Normally, he would have questioned why exactly his superior was behaving like an unhinged maniac, but the look in his eyes told him not to question it.\n\nHe complied, jogging inside the police station. Instead of the usual quiet atmosphere, he was met with every officer he had known hurriedly rushing along, all looking deeply worried. Suddenly, he felt something cold and metallic being pushed into his hands. \"Take this, you'll need it.\" A gruff voice said, disappearing as fast as it had arrived. He looked down, and saw something he never expected to carry in his line of duty.\n\nA gun. He had only been a police officer for four months, and he was being given a gun.\n\nConfused, Jeffries frantically scanned the station for a friendly face. There, he saw Officer Trenway, another new recruit. He strode over, tapping him on the shoulder. \"What the hell's going on, mate? We're in the middle of bloody East Anglia, what do we need guns for?\" The other officer answered, a grim expression written in his face."

Groaning, he leaned back into his chair and waited for the new head of MI5 to enter into the makeshift office of the PM. Right on time, Kim Philby, one of the few senior agents of MI5 still loyal to the Collaboration Government, strode in through the door, seeming a great deal more at ease than anyone else given the country was quite literally collapsing before their eyes.\n\n\"Philby, take a seat,\" said Nall-Cain, gesturing for the spy to sit down. \"I take it you realise why you're here?\"\n\n\"Of course Prime Minister\" Philby replied, crossing his legs, \"When do I begin?\"\n\n\"As soon as possible. We need to save what we can of MI5 - and fast. Who knows how many spies that damned communist Knight planted whilst he was in charge? You'll need to do a full purge, make sure everyone's loyal, everyone.\"\n\nPhilby nodded along, replying \"I will do what I can sir, you can rest assured that I and all true sons of Britain in intelligence shall work tirelessly to see the traitors destroyed and their influence cleansed from our shores.\" Nall-Cain grinned, now there was the fire that he needed! There was the determination and will that would win them this war!\n\n\"However sir, such a purge will take... time, I'm afraid. We need MI5 up and running as soon as possible if we hope to achieve victory in this war. I will of course carry out enhanced surveillance of our operatives and other such measures, but for now I believe our focus should be on winning the war.\"\n\n\"Agreed, most of the traitors will have defected with Knight already I'd imagine, but keep an eye out all the same, make sure every one of them ends up dead.\" Philby gave one final nod and shook the grateful Prime Minister's hand before leaving, quickly suppressing a satisfied smirk as he headed off to get to work."

After the long period of stability that Prime Minister Domvile gave our country, this nation was thrown into disarray by these terrorists. Because of their actions, Britons see hardships they haven't seen since the wartime years, and for what purpose? To tear down our traditions. These terrorists want to make Britain slaves of the Americans, whose Anglo-Saxon peoples struggle against an ever increasing encroachment on their rights. The so-called Resistance only wishes to bring race war, class warfare, and anarchy to this esteemed isle.\n\nOur history is a glorious one. Our people, first living as tribesmen in Northern Germany, moved to these islands and tamed their wild marshes to turn it into one of the greatest kingdoms of the medieval world. Not content to sit idle, we spread out to conquer the hills of Wales, and the mountains of Scotland next. With our island completely ours, we turned our eyes to the sea, and from Ireland to America, India, and Oceania we spread our civilization from one corner of the Earth to the other. All this was done under the auspices of our sovereign and the legitimate government which acted in his name.\n\nThese golden years culminated in the Victorian Era. The Pax Britannica. Britannia ruled the waves, and we were the unchallenged ruler of the world. And yet, we allowed subversive elements to create a rot in our society. Under the pretext of liberty, just as the resistance claims now, our institutions were slowly destroyed one by one. These subversive's final victory was achieved in the Second World War, in which our glorious empire collapsed.\n\nOnly in the last few years has Britain been finding its greatness once again, with the assistance of our Germanic brothers. This is what the Resistance wishes to stop. They want to end our national renewal before it has even begun. All in the name of democracy, they'd sooner make us a Republic and tear down the last vestiges of our cherished heritage. Stand with our Kingdom. Stand with our King. Fight for your heritage.'"

It was not normal for the cabinet to be meeting whilst Number 10 was a pile of rubble. It was not normal for half the attendees to be military officers, many from a foreign nation no less. And it was certainly not normal to be meeting as the country plunged into civil war.\n\n\"Gentlemen, we meet today as our country falls into a crisis beyond anything it has ever faced before in its long and noble history. Should we fail here, then Britain as we know and love her shall fall forever.\" The whole room nodded in agreement, Fountaine and Wallop especially so, with Butler glancing over towards Wulf alongside a fair few of the British Officers present.

General Templer, General Wulf, if you please.\" The two officers stood and began to read their reports. Wulf began by informing the Cabinet that the German garrison had now fully mobilised and was ready to fight, with fresh divisions already enroute to relieve the battered forces that had held firm against HMMLR's initial assault.\n\nTempler then took over on a grimmer note. Scotland. The complete fall of Newcastle to the rebels had cut off divisions stationed in Scotland, and they were now completely surrounded and besieged in Edinburgh. They were holding firm. For now. But unless relief came, then the entire northern army could be wiped out. \"Thank you Generals. This is grave news indeed,\" Nall-Cain said as Wulf and Templer sat back down. \"How do you recommend we proceed?\"\n\n\"Any kind of offensive is out of the question, we need to outlast the traitors and survive the winter. If we can do that, then a summer offensive will be able to smash right through their lines. \"Templer replied, with Wulf nodding in agreement.\n\n\"Thank you Generals, well gentlemen it seems our path is clear.

This means that oil is rapidly becoming one of the most precious resources available for both sides of the uprising, from both an economic and military perspective.\n\nRecommended course of action - ration any and all oil available.

We believe this to be the work of the underground trade unions the traitor Maxwell Knight assured us were destroyed - plans for the thorough destruction of these groups are being complied with the assistance of our German allies. These sabotage efforts have caused severe disruption to supply lines and have significantly impacted our capacity for military production.\n\nThe German Megacorporations (Reichswerke, AEG, Volkswagen etc) are a particularly troubled spot. The ongoing political turmoil in Germany has spread to their corporate sector, and their offices here are as embroiled in the power struggle across the channel as the rebellion here. Many senior officials within these companies are highly uncooperative with not only us, but garrison and diplomatic officials who are not supporters of their own faction, creating massive logistical problems.\n\nMuch of the workforce has also openly defected to the rebels' side, or simply refused to work. This has caused production levels to plummet and forced managers to dramatically increase working hours on the remaining functional factories, in turn spurring further defections and resignations.\n\nWe suggest temporary nationalisation of un-cooperative German industry and prioritisation of police resources to defend factories. Blackshirt auxiliaries may also prove useful in this role as guards. Solving the workforce problem is much harder, but we suggest a carrot and stick approach of temporarily increased wages along with severe penalties for refusing to work."

 collab_cw.12.d:0 "When Charlie Morris joined the resistance, he expected glory. A struggle against an evil regime to restore his beloved nation back to the rightful rule of its own people. He had expected toil, hardship, and pain - and perhaps even death itself. And if he were to die, he would do so gladly, for there can be no greater ideal to give one's life for than freedom.\n\nBut the Collaborators were not kind enough to grant him such a fate.\n\nInstead, they consigned him to work in a shithole factory in the middle of London, making the bullets that would be used by the snivelling twats that populated the regime's army to gun down his comrades. Into every hateful little shell he was forced to make on pain of death, he liked to think he channelled some of his own spite. Perhaps the gun they're loaded into would backfire, turning on its user. One could only hope.\n\nPart of Charlie wanted to get things over with and die anyway. To throw himself at some of the worthless jackboots who made sure none of the other penal workers escaped and to go out in a blaze of glory. Part of him wished that the enemy at least had the decency to gun him down with his friends, rather than to force him onwards like this.\n\nBut whenever these thoughts bubbled to the top, Charlie forced himself to think of his dear old mum, and how she'd need him when the war was over. So, steeling himself, Charlie would continue working, with only the image of his mother and the silent hope that all of the guards would spontaneously keel over and die keeping him going."

Most of their cities had fallen, their people subjugated, and their armies faltering. They were so, so close to victory.\n\nYet this was no Waterloo. This was no Roarke's Drift, no grand British victory. There would be no ode to his valour, no poem speaking of his, or anyone else's grand struggle. This was naught but a desperate fight for survival, a truly British slaughter. And yet, he was glad of the slaughter, and that, he dared not confront that.

These men are meant to deal with the resistance, what if they see the gun?\n\nFuck. Fuck. Fuck. He looked back to his palms. His fingertips had pruned. He took a deep sigh. This was it, hm?

Walking alongside him was a motley bunch: soldiers from three different divisions of the British army and a handful of Germans separated from the garrison. The victory at Manchester was not without its casualties; Charlie corralled these young men from the ruins of their squads and battalions, forming a coherent-enough squad he would lead back to headquarters. He tried to keep their spirits up on the march back; this question was among one attempt.\n\n\"I think I'll move back in with my parents,\" said Private Rhys Foster. \"Mum's family has a farm down in York, and if I never see cities like this again, it'll be too soon.\"\n\n\"A farm, eh?\" asked Private Hughie Simmons. \"Right, you've got a wife there, too. I bet you're missing her soft wool already.\" They all laughed; even Rhys, even the Germans once it was translated. It had only been two days, but this squad of cast-offs had fought together, bled together and mended each other's wounds. Charlie let them have a laugh until the sound of a bullet echoed in the streets.\n\n\"Contact!\" called out Sergeant Charlie. The men formed a column and readied their weapons. There, in the middle of the blasted-out street, was a ragged orphan, eyes bloodshot, vainly pulling the trigger on an empty pistol. The squad hesitated for a moment. Terrorised eyes peered from broken windows, splintered doorways; other eyes watched with hollow stares, dozens of dead eyes that littered the battlefield.\n\n\"Private Simmons,\" said Sergeant Roberts, \"hostile, twelve o'clock.\" Simmons nodded, stepped forward from the column and raised his rifle."

Maclean is correct, if Liverpool does fall, we can ill afford to lose our best supplies with it.\" Jones folded his arms.\n\n\"And the lads inside if that happens? We haven't anywhere near enough boats for 'em all. If we try to send them all, they'll know what we're about. They can't go east, fascists are there. They can't go south, that's death. West's the sea. Time it comes to siege, they'll cut off the north if they're not stupid. How do we get 'em out? \"\n\nNone of the three men said anything after that, the only sound in the shop being the whistling of the wind outside. \"We can't,\" said Maclean, breaking the silence. \"Not all of them at least.

Come on, the rest of the boys are waiting.\" Charlie waited in the alley for what felt like an eternity while the footsteps slowly faded away. When he was sure the two men had left, he broke back into a sprint towards the docks. Fred would still be there with the boat. He'd promised.\n\nIt was nearly nightfall when he made it to the water. He staggered towards Fred's boat with his arms raised in the air, \"Don't shoot! It's me.

He thought back to the meeting and how brave Elsie had looked, promising them that they would make it out. Jones had a plan, she said and there were camps outside the city they could hide. He'd felt so brave too, listening to her until he'd heard the rattle of machine gun fire and their brave words had turned to screams. Until he'd had to cower among the corpses, praying the Free Corps would leave him be.\n\nThe rest of the Trade Union men in the boat were looking at him then, but all he did was turn away from them and pressed his face into the side of the boat.

He waved a hand, dismissing the man.\n\n\"At ease, Corporal. Show me what it is we've got.\" The corporal nodded, drawing a knife and sawing at the rope binding the tarp to the skiff, pulling it aside. In doing so, he exposed a number of open crates filled with M14 rifles and M20 bazookas. Crowley whistled smugly, picking up an M14 and examining it. Surprisingly good condition, for something that'd come so far. The Americans definitely hadn't spared any expense. He pulled out a cloth, wiped the rifle down and set it back in the crate.\n\n\"How many more caches like this?\"\n\n\"The lads found four more throughout Prince Albert dock, sir, as well as one in Alexandra.

But he did not settle for merely the reclamation of his hometown. He continued to fight, as all proper young Englishmen did, for the reclamation of his homeland. And at the Battle of Edinburgh, when the city came under siege by the same terrorists who fought in honour of a false queen, this young man stood and fought for King and Country. Though his driver had been shot and his friend slain by a cowardly terrorist's bomb, he held the line against three waves of enemy forces, loading and firing his tank's main cannon himself, preventing them from capturing a supply depot within that city. When the fourth wave became overwhelming, he chose not to flee nor abandon the King's arms, but to render his nation a great service and deny the enemy supplies.\n\n\"Today, we honour the sacrifice of Private First Class Edwin Layton, who held the line against the traitors.

It seemed to him that the sounds of bullets flying in the distance would be enough to get any animal to move from self preservation, but clearly his cows were the exception to the rule.\n\n\"Move, Daisy\", he hissed, giving the cow ahead of him a gesture to move with his stick. \"What, you want to make friends with a bullet? I said move.\" The cow only let out a moo of protest in response, gazing at him with uncomprehending dull eyes. He sighed in frustration, and resisted the urge to smack the stick into the ground. He could still hear the sounds of gunfire in a field far below the hill he was on. It took all he had not to simply run, to leave the stubborn stupid cows to their fate, but he'd kept his farm through one war and damn if he was going to lose his livestock to another.\n\nMustering the courage to look down, he saw a farmhouse under siege, and the bodies of a number of government soldiers laying outside. A few could be seen in position behind barricades, but only a few. HMMLR in contrast were nowhere to be seen, though judging by the sounds of the shots, he expected they were somewhere behind the rocks a few hundred meters before the farmhouse. Must be winning, judging by the number of government bodies. He hoped they did honestly, that they'd stick it to-wait. What was that roar? No, he thought to himself. Not again. He couldn't bear to see it happen again.\n\nA Panzer was rolling over the other hill, like a great steel beast. He could hear screams of panic from the rocks, muffled by the sounds of the Panzer firing. After a while it ceased, and there were no more screams. As for Robert, he continued to stare down into the field, all thoughts of cows forgotten."

 britaincivilwarflavour.9.d:0 "Ever since Kurt had joined the Luftwaffe, the thing he'd always loved the most about flying was how beautiful the world was at a distance. Far above in the clouds, all the orders, drills and worldly concerns he usually dealt with melted away, leaving just a beautiful world of tiny trees and rivers below. The world below him now though, didn't look beautiful at all. In fact, it looked like hell on earth.\n\nHis plane passed over the husk of a forest, resembling a great gray pity more than anything now. A few spindly trees jutted up from the ground above a field of ash. Wherever Kurt looked, he could see craters left by where shells had struck, and the ruins of a few lonely houses. He wondered for a moment where the people who'd lived there had gone. Had they fled north? Simply been burned to ash when his bombs fell? He'd probably never know.\n\nHe gripped the controls tightly. He had a duty, he reminded himself. A duty to his fatherland, to his Führer and to his people. This war was about keeping Germans safe from both American Jewry and their puppets. He'd been too young to participate in the West Russian war, but he wasn't stupid, he knew this was war. This was the cost of protecting the German people. There was just something disturbing about seeing it from above in a way he'd never had to before.\n\nAfter several more minutes of flying, the base finally came into view, much to Kurt's relief. As he brought the plane down, he found himself overwhelmed by a feeling of melancholy. He sat silently in the cockpit for nearly a minute and would have sat longer had the other men not come to check on him to ensure he hadn't passed out from flight pressure."

Some people ran away from the chaos, as others joined the rioters in their quest to become walking flamethrowers, it seemed.\n\n\"Prime Minister?\" Fountaine asked. \"Do you mind telling me what's going on out there? Your face scares me alone.\" Nall-Cain gulped and answered with his vocal chords shaking.\n\n\"Andrew, I'm afraid that the... the people of London are rioting.\" Fountaine's heart skipped a beat. \"Shit, well, er...\" One of the Prime Minister's assistants alerted Nall-Cain, telling him that Veesenmayer is on the line. \"Sorry, let me take this call.\"\n\nBefore Nall-Cain could get a word in, Veesenmayer began, \"Listen, Mr. Prime Minister. I am going to only have to say this once hopefully and I'm going to make this quick. You see the riots outside your little house? They will kill you. They will kill all of us. They will kill your family. If you want to live, I hope you are able to realize that you need to authorize the Garrison to move in. You can decide not to, but I cannot guarantee what will happen to you. I do not want to hear a word from you until you have made your decision. Goodbye, Mr. Prime Minister.\"\n\nNall-Cain put the phone back into its holder and placed his hand against his forehead. His eyes gazed straight through his desk and the countless papers on top. \"Sir? Are you okay?\" Nall-Cain woke up from his trance.\n\n\"Um, yes. I'm doing alright, Andrew. I just got news that I am going to authorize the Garrison to move in. Which I'm going to have to do.\"\n\n\"Mr. Prime Minister, I'm afraid you shouldn't listen to that German. Send in the Blackshirts. It is more organized than the German garrison could ever be. Their home country is currently facing a leadership crisis which would obviously cause chaos in the military. Why would they be more helpful than Britain's very own men?\""

You bastards have killed Britain, and I won't be upset if you kill me at this point, you filthy Kraut!\" The garrison officer turned to the man to his left, who shook his head. The officer turned his eyes back to the bandana-cover rioter, poking the barrel of his Mauser rifle to his belly. The rioter's blood ran through the treading on the officer's boot, scraping some of it off on the pavement. The rioter's started to run, but nothing could escape the range of the German bullet.\n\nAs scenes like this unfolded all over London, the Prime Minister began to wish he could strangle Veesenmayer for what he had done. \"Edmund. You must be fucking joking with me here. Your officers just shot at least twenty-five or so people down there. Do you know how much I am going to hear about this? You jus-\"\n\nVeesenmayer raised his hand, causing Nall-Cain to pause. \"You are safe, Herr Prime Minister. You are still breathing. None of us are dead. None of your family has been harmed. So our officers did their job - with great efficiency I may add.\"\n\nNall-Cain scoffed at the idea. Noticing this, Veesenmayer slowly walked up to the Prime Minister, leaning over into his ear. \"Now now. I would not disrespect the Reich. I am an Aryan, as you know. And acting like that is surely going to bode poorly for our joint futures. My officers did their job. Do yours.\" And with that, Veesenmayer left.\n\nThe Prime Minister would storm out of the office, taking a walk across the hallways of 10 Downing Street. The yellow walls stood tall at least, as the majority of London had burnt into ash. The portraits of the many 18th century prime ministers hung with pride across the walls. Those are priceless items across the globe. He adjusted a lamp in the reception room, until a glaring realization hit him."

You are all little being used as puppets for the Krauts across the sea.\" The officer slammed the butt of his Mauser against the pavement. The rioter shoved his face into the officer's. \"Oh, I'm scared! Do it, arrest me! Fascist little twa-!\"\n\nThe officer hit him with his baton, arrested the man, and threw him behind the rest of the Blackshirts. \"Move forward, but remember. Nobody dies, guns remain on your back.\"\n\nAs reports filtered into Downing Street, Andrew Fountaine's blood pressure grew. \"What the fuck are they doing? I told my leaders down there that this is the thing they cannot do! I told them all specifically that the guns do not leave their arms and to go as hard as possible.\"\n\n\"Andrew, are people dying out there? Veesenmayer threatened my life if this happened but look. Nobody's dying.\"\n\nFountaine glared back at Nall-Cain, \"Bullshit. I still see new fires sparking as we speak, and I've gotten at least a half-a-dozen reports from commanders on the ground that men have died.\"\n\nNall-Cain responded with a general distaste in his mouth, \"This matter is far out of my hands by this point, I just do not want dead bodies out my window.\"\n\nFountaine shook his head irritably."

 wallop.1.d:0 "It was strange how one could know a man, but not really know him at all. In theory, Edward should know the Earl of Portsmouth, especially with how often they'd met. He'd even been subjected to a solid ten minutes of the lord's agricultural opinions-and Wallop had no shortage of opinions, at a Balmoral party once. Even so, at the time he'd taken only moderate notice, considering him just another eccentric lord vying for attention. No sooner had he finished that thought than the door swung open and a servant entered, followed by the Prime Minister. Wallop bowed.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" pronounced Gerard Wallop dramatically, rising from his perfect bow. He gestured to the couch across from Edward, \"May I?\" Edward nodded.\n\n\"Please. My congratulations on acquiring the BPP's confidence, and on your ascension to Prime Minister. It's a relief to have someone I know I can rely on in the office.\" That last part was a bit of an exaggeration, but Edward figured he ought to start off on a good foot now that he finally had a Prime Minister who seemed to respect him.\n\n\"Your words honor me, your Majesty. If I may say so, your confidence means even more than the party's does. We are all servants of the Crown after all.\" Wallop's face took on a serious expression. \"And you have my word, your Majesty, that so long as I remain Prime Minister, I shall never allow the Crown's authority to be challenged again. This last little uprising will be the last of its kind.\"\n\nMaybe this could be a good thing after all, the King considered. After Lloyd-George's coughing, Bedford's histrionics, Chesterton's dismissiveness and Domvile's disinterest, having a Prime Minister who actually listened to him would be a welcome change.

A prettily illustrated forest scene surrounded the two figures, framing them in a wreath of leaves, roots and branches.\n\nDerek cocked his head, giving the poster a once over. He figured it probably had to be a government poster - who else could it be, now that no one was stupid or suicidal enough to be hanging HMMLR ones. It didn't look like a government poster, though, and Derek had seen them all. He knew the one with the German bloke and the English bloke shaking hands, the one with the blackshirts, the one with the shifty looking Jew scaring a kid. No, this poster was brand new, and it didn't look one bit like the ones he'd seen before.\n\nThe chap on the poster looked pretty stupid in his opinion. Looked like a bit of a git really, wearing whatever the hell he was wearing. He didn't know what a Young English Kindred was either, but it probably had something to do with the kid? Derek couldn't really make heads or tails of the poster, and just felt confused the longer he looked at it. Suddenly, a familiar voice from inside pulled his attention away.\n\n\"Oi, what the hell was that! The ball's right bloody there you shit.

The meeting will be held at 15:00 at my office in Downing Street. Any necessary questions can be directed to my secretary.'\n\nVeesenmayer read over the note one final time before entering Number 10. A summoning. For him? He couldn't believe Wallop's nerve, summoning his betters like that. Not once had this happened in the time he had held this post. If the man was trying to send him a message, he would respond in kind. Upon his entry, he was directed into a room where Wallop sat, drinking a glass of whiskey with an intolerably smug look plastered on his face.\n\n\"Prime Minister,\" he said, teeth gritted so tightly that he felt he may chip one of them. \"What a pleasure to meet with you. I must say, I am confused by the circumstances of this meeting. Why, may I ask, did you choose not to meet me at the embassy? After all, it is tradition at this point. Domvile himself even had his own room there for our meetings, and it would be no trouble to secure one for you as well.\"\n\nWallop sat silent for a minute, before smiling. \"Well, I apologise for any unintentional offence, sir, but a Prime Minister is well within his rights to call ambassadors to meet with them whenever they may choose - be they from France, Denmark, and even Germany. Regardless, I'm sure we can come to an understanding. In fact, that is why I requested this meeting. I hoped to set a... precedent for future discussions. A review over Britain's obligations to the Pakt, I suppose. Previous relations were one sided, and I hoped for a more equal relationship, one beneficial for both sides.\"\n\nVeesenmayer bit his tongue, seething internally.

Chesterton enjoyed these personal meetings, not only to open the mental floodgates for memories of his time as leader, but also as he enjoyed the Earl of Portsmouth's company.\n\nNo other previous Prime Minister could be more explicit and clear with than the current, and Chesterton often exploited this as a building block for policy discussion as he did here. \"You know, Gerard, I've been thinking of the past recently. I haven't even been thinking about the events after the Germans liberated Britain. But past that. During the times of the Empire. It was crushed in the wake of the Second World War, and I've been pondering -how are we going to fix that?\"\n\nWallop had not really thought about the Empire in a while, but for whatever reason he was compelled to idly blurt something out. \"Well, it was way out of our control, of course. Churchill and the rest of the Tories during that time were being puppeted by the interests of their Judeo-Bolshevik-Masonic-Liberal operators. Some Labour statesmen had their minds in the right place, but they were weeded out by those same operators. It's truly unfortunate.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, it was as if a bulb had gone off in Chesterton's head. \"Absolutely. And I just haven't really been able to find a permanent solution to it.\" He paused, trying to emulate an improvised stroke of genius, although he had this thought for weeks. \"In fact, what if it were possible for us to declare the Empire exiled within Britain in a way, and once the Judeo-Capitalistic collaborators are removed, we will rule the waves once more.\"\n\nPulling his head out from his book, Wallop looked at Chesterton with awe at such an idea."

Now, the rug had been pulled from under them.\n\nThe middle-aged man he had been arguing with scoffed dismissively. \"As if, boy. Pure and utter nonsense. To think we need jumped up hooligans to rebuild our nation you must be absolutely mad. Britain needs a steady hand to avoid shipwreck, and his Lordship will provide more than enough of one.\" It went without saying that such a man had supported Chesterton and Bedford through thick and thin - this was nothing new.\n\nIn previous meetings, those who lent support to the pragmatists would confront both groups. But their voices were silent amongst the shouting match. Those that saw where the winds were blowing decided to find new bedfellows, whilst those that were slow on the uptake found themselves pushed out. Their BPP membership had come to an abrupt end.\n\nThe local party chairman, not wanting this to erupt into a brawl, stood up to try and assuage the situation. \"Gentlemen, gentlemen.

Downing Street was his, and the Old Guard's legacy was secured. Some of his oldest and most faithful friends stood by his side, realizing a vision that mere decades ago would have seemed impossible. The rabble in the commons had been brought to heel, and the rabble in the resistance crushed underfoot. So if this was victory, why did it taste so bitter?\n\nOpening his eyes, he looked around with a frown. The truth stared back at him from the walls of the study, still ornamented with paintings and decorations chosen by Domvile, not him. The title of Prime Minister might be his, but the party's vision was every bit as much Domvile and Chesterton's as his own. A needed compromise, but one that rankled all the same. What if Gardiner's words about Social Credit had truly had merit to them? If he'd had the courage to try something new? Perhaps he would never know, now.\n\nIt was necessary, he told himself again. His vision would come, once England was ready to receive it. A green and beautiful land, tilled by families worthy of her.

They seemed to be busy having a debate of some description - although the topic did not matter to the two. Indeed, their eyes were drawn to something else far more interesting.\n\nThe seats that had laid vacant for decades declared for the opposition had recently been filled by none other than the former 'pragmatist' faction of the party. Wallop had expelled them, and even with this large chunk of the party gone, the British People's Party still had a supermajority. Even with their attempt against the Old Guard, almost all of the pragmatists knew that because of the nation's election laws, their seats may flip given time.\n\nThe pair watching were very amused by that fact. \"You know, Hastings, I've been hearing rumors about all those chaps down there. And let me tell you, there is never a rumor about something good!\" The two chuckled harder than they ever had in years. \"You see the one on the right side? I heard...heh... I heard his wife cheated on him for a Bolshevik in the HMMLR!\"\n\nRab Butler was very involved in debate on the Commons' floor. He was practically the leader of the pragmatist opposition, defending several of the pragmatist members when they were attacked and adopted a fierce demeanor towards his former colleagues. Although more focused on the debate on the ground, he looked up occasionally trying to detect what some of the noise was coming from above. He did not catch Wallop and Bedford just yet.

The unfairness of the situation rang true, when Bedford, Chesterton, and Nall-Cain reminded him of how cruel it was that they were bereft of Domvile. When the proceedings began to come to a close, he strolled up to the podium, eyes lingering on the casket as he did so. It was closed, given the nature of Domvile's death.

Wallop, kicking his feet up on the desk, explained to himself, \"I have to clean this office one of these days.\" The day had left by himself, with his only true constant companions to accompany him - his thoughts.\n\nThe most baseline and predictable of the voices in his head floated the same idea that he had been following - and indeed, had planned to follow - for the foreseeable future; to continue the agendas of his predecessors and finally fulfill the party's decades-old dreams, including continuing the process of eventually building the invaluable 'New English Character'.\n\nBut another less familiar voice brought into play an idea that truly piqued his interest. He had the chance to bring about everything he had ever wanted - the chance to build the dignified agrarian state fueled by a Social Credit system that he, not the party, had always dreamt of. It was right there - he needed only to take it.\n\nIt wasn't as if this idea had no support amongst the party leaders. Lord Tavistock has promised Wallop his eager support for the latter personally, as he was blocked from enacting such legislation in his own time as Prime Minister - although just as before, Chesterton and a wider section of the party would be left aghast once they heard of the plans.\n\nHe went back to the first idea, considering that the Old Guard's legacy would be at risk and could crumble under such a radical change. If he stuck to the party's baseline, he would be able to keep Britain afloat for much longer under his leadership. But was that false sense of stability really worth it when Britain was stuck in the dirt and he had the chance to change all of it?"

However, we cannot rest easy on our laurels, a course must be charted...\"\n\nSighing inwardly, the king wondered to himself, not for the first time when Wallop's speech would end. He was used to boredom during Privy Council meetings, which usually consisted of whining about the perception of him doing something or other. The dull, clearly rehearsed speech though, bored him even more. Thank God it wasn't Bedford speaking at least.\n\n\"...a new bold course, set by loyal servants of His Majesty and the Crown. To simply continue as we have is to cast England into the abyss, now is the time for action. A return of our land to proper English tradition can only be done by decisive leadership from a newly empowered Crown, free from the bickering that plagues the commons. To that end, this government shall embark upon a number of initiatives, commencing with the issuance of Crown Credit to the deserving, the revival of proper country traditions and the investment of vast sums into agriculture...\"\n\nEdward blinked, staring around the room in confusion. The reactions of the men around him ranged from bewilderment matching his own to shocked fury on the face of Chesterton, as well as even excitement in Bedford's case. Had Wallop simply made that part of the speech up on the spot? Or-\n\n\"Lovely joke, Gerard,\" thundered Chesterton, startling him. \"But I think it's time we got back to real matters.\" Wallop raised an eyebrow in response before replying.\n\n\"You are to refer to me as Prime Minister, Arthur. And I can promise you that I mean every word.\"\n\n\"Well you must have gone stark raving mad then!\" Chesterton snarled, his coarse voice having abandoned its gentlemanly character completely. \"None of us will support you when you've spat on our friend's grave like this. Not until you regain your wits.\" He stormed from the room, followed by a number of men.\n\nWallop watched him go, seeming briefly regretful before shaking his head and resuming his speech. Edward wasn't listening though. All he could do was sit there, still as a statue, terrified of just what madness Wallop would drag him into."

Something, Wallop noted with pleasure as he surveyed the room, was not the case here. Instead each man sat orderly, ready to hear his words. He cleared his throat.\n\n\"The difficulties that we have faced cannot be overstated, and we can rightly celebrate having overcome them. However, we cannot rest easy on our laurels, a course must be charted...\"\n\nWallop could see the men in the room smiling and nodding in approval as he spoke. Arthur, his oldest and longest lasting friend, grinned from ear to ear. The only man who seemed disappointed was Bedford, and even then it was a muted disappointment, given he nodded along with all the rest. They would all stand united behind him, the Earl knew, united in a way that the BPP had never been. No more would they be beholden to a whimpering little rat like Butler, or a screeching would-be Mussolini like Fountaine. After so many years and so many trials, Britain was finally theirs and theirs alone.\n\n\"...a course faithful to the legacy of our party, to our nation and to our glorious history. Cruelly torn from us as the empire was by Churchill and his masters from above, its spirit lives on. To preserve it forevermore, we shall raise a New British Character, one rooted in pride, in tradition and in corporatism refit to suit the Briton alone. The empire breathes, gentlemen, and lives on!\"\n\nThey were all applauding then, even Bedford. Barry would be smiling as well, were he here thought the Earl to himself sadly. For the barest second though, the thought also drifted through his mind that had Barry gone further he might have still been with them. Could he truly be content to simply mimic those same policies that had led his friend to an early grave? Wallop scowled to himself, seeking to banish the unbidden and unworthy thought from his mind."

 wallop.15.d:0 "The Cunningham family, amongst dozens of others, piled into the Ombersley cricket pitch, where rows of chairs and a hastily-assembled podium laid out in the middle. The headmaster of the local school rose to the podium, to inform the parents of the government's new curriculum. Gone were the days of boring books and rote education; proper English stock needed a practical education. The boys would learn a trade, the girls would learn to keep a home, and both would learn to appreciate the British countryside through outdoor recreation.\n\nThe father, Alan, looked nervously at his sullen son. He was a bright lad, pale and bookish, and he was not sure how he would take to this new direction. The mother, Piper, was more concerned about the future. The plan had always been for Elliot and Elise to leave Ombersley for greener pastures: Birmingham, maybe even Manchester. That was contingent on them finding a good school, or at least a better job outside the village.\n\nThe son, Elliot, had always hated sports. He preferred books; he was a regular at the library, swiftly advancing from children's tales to the classics. Now he was expected—compelled, even—to spend long hours throwing himself into the dirt. The daughter, Elise, felt the pain of frustrated ambition. Her uncle was a woodworker in Droitwich Spa. She had many questions about carpentry, and he was keen to answer them. But even she, the youngest member of the family, knew what it meant for a girl's education to focus on cooking and croquet.\n\nSuch were the thoughts that roiled the minds of all parents and children on the field. Even the headmaster read them with some anxiety. They felt as if they were being chained to the village, to a land of half-timbered houses and monotony. Worse, they were told it was their natural state, that this was what the English people needed. As they all went back to their homes that night, everyone had, in their own fashion, the same thought:"

 wallop.16.d:0 "Were you to ask any man, woman or child in England how many Prime Ministers the nation can have at once, they would give you a funny glance and note only one man may sit in Downing Street at a time. Yet were one to sit inside the British People's Party today, one would see a curious state of affairs where offices of state are held by not one Prime Minister, but by three. Ostensibly, this triumvirate is a union of equals and bosom friends, restored to their rightful place in governance, combining their influence to become more powerful than ever before. Yet just like the Roman triumvirates of old, three separate heads rarely act in perfect harmony.\n\nThe first head lies distracted, its eyes far from its post. The Duke of Bedford may nominally hold the title of Chancellor of the Exchequer, but the Duke's visits to the Treasury are few and far between. MP's and secretaries alike whisper of his endless visits to Westminster, with MP's trading bets on which of them the Duke will try to cajole for their support next. With its master gone, the Exchequer has slipped into something of a limbo, only broken up by directives from Downing Street itself.\n\nThe second head looks in all directions, torn between countless tasks. Torn from his element in the House of Lords, the Earl of Portsmouth can rarely be found far from his office. As the messages to said office grow by the day, the Earl's own proposals sink further and further into the pile of papers on the Prime Minister's desk. Servants scurry anxiously about Downing Street, eager to avoid the Prime Minister's worsening temper or a tirade about the foulness of London.\n\nThe third head smiles with a ravenous hunger. Called back from his humiliating exile, Arthur Kenneth Chesterton now stalks through the halls of the Home Office, eager to make it his own. Whether Blackshirt, MI5, or Constable, all find themselves summoned to Chesterton's policy meetings, ones inevitably exited by grinning blackshirts. So accustomed to his role is the third head, that its voice is that most heard in cabinet now, almost as much as that of the Prime Minister himself."

There were countless other MPs there as well, resting from the grind of daily legislative work. He too was exhausted, but still had a strong itch to do something. Getting up, he started to move across the lounge, asking anyone he came across questions about how they believed the current ministry was progressing and how it was affecting the nation. This was met mostly with irritated glances and one-note answers. After the member for Horsely told him to shove off, his brow furrowed. This was going nowhere. He needed to do something more bold.\n\nMaking his way to the covered stage, he unveiled himself from underneath currents. This was met with little aplomb, aside from a few confused glance. Noticing there was no microphone set up, the elder statesmen sighed quietly. He never knew how to set one up, because most of the time someone did it for him.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen!\" he said hoarsely. This got their attention - although not the kind he was hoping for. \"I hope you all are enjoying this occasion. It's not very often we all get to take a rest from work, eh?\" Hoping to get a quick laugh out of the crowd, the room stayed eerily silent. \"Well, I am up here for a quick announcement. More accurately, a general message I hope most of you keep leaving here.\"\n\nSomeone coughed. \"Almost all of us here are with our different views in life and different views politically. And that's fine. We all need our opinions expressed of course. However, I must implore all of you that today is not the day to have factionalism within the party. We must all stay united under the banner of the Earl of Portsmouth and our Prime Minister, Sir Wallop. Can we get a round of applause for our dear friend and leader?\""

 wallop.18.d:0 "The stress and the fatigue had been burdening him, and it showed. Slouching against the Lord's lounger and his eyes barely staying open, he did not make a good look for the camera that was being pointed at his face. Knowing this was his first public appearance in two weeks, he forced himself up and began after the introduction was finished.\n\n\"My lords, in this day and age, we have been utterly exhausted - mostly from the multiple uprisings of treacherous cowards unwilling to look at the world around them. And unfortunately, we have also fallen into the same trap as the capitalistic snakes that tore this country to shreds in the first place.\" He paused, letting it sink into the room around him. \"We have forgotten about the beauty of nature, and how reliant people across the globe are to the agricultural industry. Without such an industry, famines will befall thousands of families, and many would have to hunt for a new source of income.\"\n\nThe silence of the chamber both haunted and empowered the Prime Minister to continue on after a few seconds of pause. \"And yet, the greedy, selfish industrialists continue to pump kilograms of toxic chemicals into our dirt whilst tearing through resources faster than a machine gun. They have harmed this nation to an extent comparable to the Uprising! My lords, we must stop this essential tool of the capitalistic nations now. I hope, my lords, all here are in the defence of the nation's beauty and will take a stand against such activities. Thank you.\"\n\nA standing ovation followed the Prime Minister's proposal. Shocked by such a positive response, Wallop turned to the Duke of Bedford behind him, who in return gave Wallop a wide smile. Turning again to face the opposition, Wallop saw the same story. Everybody on the other side clapped in a quieter manner - although the reason to him is unknown. With this supermajority was its minority, which Wallop saw and chalked it up to pure arrogance."

 wallop.19.d:0 "The fireplace crackled, its light bathing the room and the three figures inside in amber hues. Wallop let out a deep sigh of relief as he leaned back into an armchair, idly pushing his cane aside and staring outside at the night sky. Bedford gave him a sympathetic glance, clicking his tongue.\n\n\"I know it's exhausting, Gerard. Completely and utterly exhausting, if I do say so. But we'll only need to suffer all our enemies a little longer now. Particularly with that loathsome little Butler gone.\"\n\nChesterton's face broke into an eager grin, \"Congratulations are in order, my friend! You did what Hastings and I never could with him. Here's to it being the first of many debts paid to old enemies. With interest.\" He said the last part with a vindictive relish, the light from the fireplace giving his face an almost predatory character.\n\nWallop tapped his cane, thinking back to Butler's impotently furious efforts on the floor of the commons since his ascension. \"It was a jolly good show watching him bleat, wasn't it? Such a pity he had to be expelled from the party but well, he hasn't quite got the sort of English character the BPP needs.\" He drawled in a mocking voice.\n\nThe three men all shared a hearty laugh. \"You know,\" said Chesterton when the three men had finished, \"This is the same room they told me that whelp Fountaine and his backbenchers had stabbed me in the back. And look at him now! Whimpering like a scared dog that the Blackshirts are mine again.\"\n\nWallop smirked. \"Speaking of whimpering, you ought to have seen Veesenmayer fume and pout when I summoned him here. He knows who holds the cards now with the state Germania's been in.\"\n\nA shared laugh at the expense of Butler, Fountaine and Veesenmayer followed the remark, after which the three friends continued to trade jibes and taunts at beaten foes late into the night. So preoccupied were they with their good cheer, that when they finally departed Downing Street's staircase, none took note of the portraits of Prime Ministers looking down from the walls, not even their own."

The enclosed leaflet contains further information regarding how Credit Vouchers may be applied, and the circumstances under which they will be accepted. We wish you the best of luck in your productive enterprises.\"\n\nThe leaflet gave more details, along with assurances that wherever pounds were good, so were credit vouchers. So far as Clara could tell, it was actually trying to tell her that the government had made a new type of money just for people like her. Supposedly purely to help her \"diversify her goods and expand her business.\"\n\nClara scoffed, sliding the letter aside on the shop counter before lighting a cigarette. What utter rubbish. People had no decency - none at all. She knew times were hard, but swindling the desperate with fake government letters was just vile. The idiots could've tried to make it plausible at least - London caring enough to send her money, now that was a riot. Then again, she thought while looking around at the empty shop, the day was going slow. And the address on the enclosed leaflet really was a government office, she knew it well enough. She could at least see what the fuss was about, she resolved, pulling on her coat and flipping the shop sign to CLOSED.\n\nIt was to her surprise that when she actually arrived at the government office, she wasn't alone. A long line of people she recognized stretched past the building. There was Arthur from the pharmacy, and Helena from the grocer's. Each person, she noticed, clutched the same letter she did. Still in shock the letter hadn't been a trick, she silently filed into line. Briefly, she wondered just where the government had gotten the money for all this, but to be honest, she didn't care.

 wallop.21.d:0 "On the Prime Minister's desk lay an act, put forward by the Department of Agriculture and approved by Commons and Lords alike. A small part of him had agonised over the decision as the bill made its way to his desk; now that he looked at it directly, he realised it was no great betrayal. One little signature, a few strokes of the pen, and Gerard Wallop had sealed a new compact between the cities and the countryside.\n\nThe [GetYear] Industrial Renovation Act laid a framework for his government's future industrial policy, one which concentrated the corporations towards the cities. Corporate taxes on assets in the countryside would be severely increased, heavy enough to drive them from the hills and the plains. In the cities, however, conditions would be far more favourable: minimum wages would be slashed across the board, guaranteeing cheaper labour.\n\nThe stick and the carrot, by which Wallop would contain the German corporations. They could have the cities, with its pollution (environmental and spiritual), so long as they did not touch the countryside. They would know what to do with those concrete prisons and their architects. Wallop cared far more for the country, where the English spirit would find succour and salvation. He planned to see the British economy shift its attention away from the cities to the villages; crown credit would spur on this transition.\n\nOutside his window, the London smog rose to its peak; a grey haze swirled around the cityscape, choking the life out of its inhabitants. Even here, Wallop could taste that pollution in the air. He set aside the signed act and looked out the window. He imagined it worse: smokestacks billowing poison, filling the air and the lungs; the Thames black and green with run-off. He accepted that it would get worse. If it makes them happy, the Germans could have the cities, so long as the English had the country."

His disdain for these men had only grown further as he had grown closer to power, and this climbing ascent would not pause this day.\n\nHe found himself at the centre of attention in the room. Finding the queue to speak, he cleared his throat. \"Thank you, everyone for attending this evening. I am sure that it has been a long commute here from Germany. I would not make all of you come this way for any bad news, so let me get straight to the point.\"\n\nHis eyes gazed through the hundreds of heads. He had come to know many of these men - these faces in suits, these blank people - in his own time as the Prime Minister - although many of them simply blurred together. Bedford thought nothing of it. \"Our government has been initiating a plan to raise funding to the Department of Agriculture and bring high taxes to corporations in the countryside. However, he has also brought a lower minimum wage to the industrial cities. Very daunting offer, gentlemen?\"\n\nThe more Bedford spoke, the more groans could be heard. In some areas, some turned to speak to the man to his side. He feared that they thought this was just a game to settle old scores. Bedford resumed to stop the banter between executives, \"I know what many of you are thinking, however those thoughts are profoundly incorrect. The Ministry of Lord Portsmouth only seeks to focus its efforts on the countryside and as a benefit, the cities will be in all of your industrial capable hands!\"\n\nBedford soon initiated a vote, where almost every man raised their hand in favor.

Nerves were for men caged in a country that despised them, filled with vile communists that wanted him dead and up-jumped rabble like Domvile and Chesterton who saw him as nothing more than a figurehead.

God favours the faithful, and we intend to serve God and King with diligence.\n\nThough I served in this position for a limited time and under extraordinary circumstances, I do have two pieces of advice to offer. First, I urge you to be cautious in dealing with the continent, particularly on matters of German conglomerates. They see in all new appointees to this office a weakness they might exploit, and I recommend that you find within yourself a well of strength to draw from in all your dealings with them. Second, I caution you against relying on one influence within the Cabinet. Our government, though far more united in purpose than the rabble that Domvile was forced to associate with, is one of diverse thought and interests.

I don't remember what I said then, but here's the truth now: you are an old man who lost the fire within yourself, and it took a younger generation to keep the flame alight. Maybe you think alcohol might catch the fire and keep it burning, but all it does is dull your mind and slur your speech.\n\nI should have expected Wallop would sober you up long enough to take revenge. I should have prepared for it, but I let Rab Butler distract me from my true enemies. Now I have to watch as your gin-sodden corpse struts around the Home Office trying to resurrect a long-dead past. If there was any justice in this world I would be Prime Minister and you would be spending the rest of your miserable life watching me drag your friends into the 20th century.\n\nDon't write me, don't call me, don't go looking for me. I won't have any part in the death of what could have been glorious.\n\nRegards,"

You hold in your hands the British economy, as intricate and fragile as a Swiss watch. Handled carefully, it shall serve you and the British people well, but even one misstep, one erratic notion no matter how slight, might knock the intricate clockwork out of place.\n\nI credit my success in keeping the economy stable to two things: focusing on Britons' material needs over all else, and maintaining my ability to work under great pressure. While I understand your past troubles with the latter, I must stress to you the former. You cannot direct economic policy by looking at what could and should be, but rather what currently is. You must be willing to face reality and address the problems before you as they are, no matter how daunting it might seem to you.\n\nYour government is a many-headed beast, and all those heads seem to look toward the past. I am not certain what the future holds for it and Britain, but I know this: you cannot repeat the failures of previous governments and expect new results. It is now your responsibility to ensure those failures are never again repeated.\n\nRegards,"

I am sure that England is in good hands with such experienced and dignified men leading it.\n\nYou need not fret, Lord Portsmouth, for I have confidence in your ability to lead England. I recall our time in the Domvile administration and your enthusiasm for agricultural matters. Whomever you select for your cabinet, knowing the company you keep, shall too perform their tasks with diligence and determination.\n\nHowever, if I may respectfully offer some advice, I would kindly ask you to take care with your direction of the Foreign Office. As a former and distinguished Foreign Secretary myself, I can attest to the importance of cultivating good relations with Germany. I spent many nights in the homes of important dignitaries, captains of industry and garrison commanders, building the relationships and favours necessary to maintain their favour.\n\nNever forget that we live in a new age, one dominated by the continent, and Britain's role is to be a tower of security, sanctity and respectability in Europe. I am sure that you will consider these words greatly in the years to come.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you would like an audience for your concerns.

The idea of a pagan folk dancer being placed in charge of the Einheitspakt's second-largest economy is a ludicrous one—and yet the Prime Minister is committed to this course of action.\n\nRegarding your economic policies, I have recently taken the time to read C. H. Douglas, and I find his theories so lacking in credibility or feasibility that it baffles me why you and Wallop are so eager to implement policies which shall do great harm to our economy. It baffles me that an incoming Chancellor believes in the rapid injection and extraction of money in circulation. It shocks me that you could believe there is such an appreciable difference in the flow of payments made to households and payments to firms. It terrifies me that I have given genuine consideration to retrieving my daughter's old economics textbooks and copying for you the section on inflation.\n\nYou have at your disposal His Majesty's Treasury, which includes thousands of civil servants and bureaucrats learned and experienced in economics. Were it in my power, I would command you to listen to them, and not to nationally pursue an untested, untried and unsound theory. Instead, I can only ask that you listen to their reasoning, and hope that yours wins out.\n\nRegards,"

It is our sacred duty to revive them, but it is your duty to promote them: within the Isles, through Europe and over the entire world.\n\nBut before we can do this, we must engage in unseemly business. Germany remains supreme, and so long as the continent remains within their control, we will need their support. Though I served only a brief time in your position and under irregular circumstances, I found that half my time was spent appeasing them.\n\nOur charted course, towards the revitalisation of English land, shall put us into conflict with their conglomerates. I have a plan to alleviate this, but I will need your assistance. Expect a meeting from me in the future. Consider this a first trial for you, one of many moments when we must appease this sick man of a master.\n\nGod willing, when the continent chokes on its own bile, England shall reclaim her rightful place in the world.

I assume that Fountaine was too churlish to even grant you the dignity of a similar response.\n\nWhen I first heard of your intent to become Prime Minister, I expected a continuation of former governments. Instead, upon hearing of your cabinet, I recalled a conversation we shared just before the civil war. It seems that you have finally become the Mussolini of agriculture, lord and protector of English stock. Still, unlike Fountaine's lot, you at least did Britain the courtesy of appointing men familiar with agricultural matters and not just rhetoric.\n\nWhat concerns me more is your full-throated approval for dangerous economic policies. I have already written at length to your new Chancellor of the Exchequer, but I expect my concerns have been ignored. Therefore, I will approach you directly: your policies of crown credit will be an unmitigated disaster. You cannot purchase economic prosperity in this manner without a great risk of runaway prices and crippling your ability to keep up. It is akin to a man shooting himself in the foot in the hopes that the open wound might make him more aerodynamic.\n\nI implore you, as a former Chancellor who kept our economy stable during moments of great difficulty, to reconsider all these policies which threaten to immiserate the British people and put her financial situation in jeopardy. Whatever you might think of Douglas' theories, they are unsound and untested, and rather than even a measured trial you are approaching this task with a broad brush.

It still took him by surprise; to think that the old boy was gone, to think that he was now in his place. There was still the cuckoo cage in the corner, the third shelf lined with nature books. He was so busy with the necessities of his new position that he had no time to clean up the office itself, to strip away what remained of Maxwell Knight and replace it with what made up Kim Philby.\n\nNo matter; redecoration would be saved for a later date. The clock ticked eleven; through the window, he could see the moon and the stars poked through the black fabric of the sky. Beneath the cold light of a desk lamp, Philby pored over intelligence reports from MI5. His MI5. They spoke of unrest in the cities and the countryside.\n\nIn the former, the British People's Party was tearing itself apart with Wallop's sudden redirection towards his pet beliefs. The Old Guard were split, knives out against traitors in their ranks; the Ideologues were like headless chickens; and the Pragmatists were in shock at the requests from Number 10. In the latter, rapid changes in social and economic policy created rapid social unrest. An influx of internal immigration, citizens answering the call of Crown Credit, were amassing in villages and towns unprepared for their arrival. Prices were rising and falling daily; shopkeepers and traders had no idea how to respond to the new system.\n\nPhilby set about a briefing for the Prime Minister. In these matters, he always felt it best to type the report himself. He wrote about Fountaine loyalists ready to be plucked from his camp like ripe fruit. Butler-affiliated bureaucrats struggling to fulfil their requests. And throughout all of this, rumblings of more resistance—but nothing to fear, Prime Minister. The Civil War has put any thought of further resistance to bed. Dissent in your ranks needs greater attention. No need to worry about rebellion."

The very same desk where Barry had once brought him a report on HMMLR as Defence Secretary. The empty spot on the wall, where he'd once hung a photo of himself on a South African campaign. The office was his and yet not his, no. Never again his. Not since Fountaine had taken that from him. \n\nOh he was proud of Gerard. How could he not be, when his friend's ascendance meant the triumph of their shared vision? All's well that ends well, as the Bard had once said. Even so...it felt wrong. He ran his finger over a small hole in the wall. Still there, after so many years. God, it was all the same. \n\nVisions passed through his mind's eye. Stirling shot entering the country, or strung up like the traitor he was. Triumphant toasts with Gerard, Hastings and Barry, where they congratulated him on his many successes as Prime Minister. Cursed Fountaine sitting as a nameless, worthless backbencher worthy of being remembered by no one. And most of all, him sitting at that desk, in the knowledge he was still Prime Minister. \n\nAll beautiful lies.

He'd never been fond of having many guests in his home-and his appetite for guests had decreased even more with his former wife's constant demands for them. Yet for the oldest of friends, he would always make an exception, particularly for men he shared so much with. \n\nIt had been his idea to invite some old strugglers, so to speak. A little get together, solely for those who'd been with him as he'd founded the BPP. There were so few of them left now, though. What remained of those noble few could be crowded into a few armchairs, waiting to hear him speak. He cleared his throat. \n\n\"Dear friends, we have so much to be proud of. We struggled, I-I will not deny that we struggled much, in recent years. In spite of treasonous bolshevism though, in spite of upstarts from below, we have done it! The BPP stands united, and Britain shall march into the future, despite her mis-steps.\" His friends clapped, with Beckett raising a toast to him. Bedford smiled in appreciation, before excusing himself to go see to the meal the servants were preparing. \n\nIt had only been an adequate speech, he thought to himself, but what else could he do when things were only adequate? He would never say a word against Arthur, but the man had grown so overbearing of late. Remarkably close minded too, refusing to hear a word about Social Credit. Not to mention too concerned with the thoughts of demagogues and public mobs. \n\nThough perhaps he shouldn't be so harsh on Arthur. It was undeniably true that his, Gerard's and Arthur's leadership had made the BPP immortal, and one day synonymous with Britain itself. So he hoped at least. There was that horrible, squirming nagging fear that Britain's children might one day be as dismissive of his legacy as his own had."

And yet no matter how how many times he re-read the paper searching desperately for any mistake anywhere, nothing would change the contents of the paper Rab Butler had been staring at for the past hour now. Over one hundred MPs had backed neither himself nor Fountaine, but a third man, one whose political prospects Butler had believed to have been incinerated along with Domvile. But there he was, a little photo enclosed in the report to really hammer in the danger this man posed by a helpful Civil Servant.\n\nGerard Wallop, The Earl of Portsmouth.\n\nHe was not alone of course. Oh no. That would be too easy. Wallop always had been one of the \"Old Guards\" in the BPP, one of those sickening, simpering traitors who grinned ear to ear when jackboots marched across London. Butler had watched as their influence slowly waned over the years. Hastings Russell, the Duke of Bedford was a relic of a distant age. A.K Chesterton, that thuggish brute, had seen his own base ripped out from under him by Fountaine. And Domvile was now a permanent resident of Downing Street. They should have collapsed into obscurity by now, but the weeds had persisted, and threatened the garden like never before.\n\nFountaine's ranting and raving in the Commons was an annoyance for certain, but he was powerless against Butler's majority. A majority that meant as much as a petition to men like Wallop, and whilst the Commons was lost to him, the Lords was anything but. Wallop's power needed to be broken. He and the old Fascists of the BPP were a clear minority in the Lords, but most active Peers who could have opposed them were across the ocean in Canada, leaving the Upper House free to be co-opted for their own agenda. The Parliament Act would fix all this, but first it had to be passed. And to do that, Wallop had to be defeated."

It was a cold comfort to know that it wasn't all for nothing, given the price. \"If only, Reggie. All we've done so far is slap a bandage on the wound... and there'll be plenty more hard work to come. All of which will come to nothing if we have to fear a veto at every step.\" He carefully set down his teacup and looked squarely at the Foreign Secretary. \"You're completely sure that these 'friends' will follow through?\"\n\nThe jovial man nodded, sipping his drink. \"They'll follow through, they know what's good for the country is good for them, and they're clever enough to know that's what we are. I'll talk to them, remind them of that, and have them whisper in a few ears.\" After a moment of dabbing at his lip with a napkin, Maudling continued. \"My people have plenty of strings to pull, even with the Lords. Just give them a little time, they'll have the Lords dancing to our tune and lining up to back the bill.\"\n\nHe seemed confident enough. Then again confidence had never been an issue for Maudling.

The Government of the Right Honourable Prime Minister is weak. It is a government of degeneracy. This government seeks to return our sceptered isle to when we were at our weakest, a time when Britain was destroyed by the weakness of her own people.

Well, if that is the desire of this government, I proclaim here that we loyal few will stand for Albion until the very end.\"\n\nAs his speech ended, Fountaine noted that only the few scattered Ideologues within the chamber showed even the barest hint of support, and the speaker yawned as he sat down."

Budgets that could be slashed, property taxes left unpaid. Nothing on Fountaine himself, yet. But give us time.\"\n\nButler hummed. \"Reggie's plan first. Then Angus's.

When he walked through the corridors, civil servants nervously stepped away from him, and MPs side-eyed him as he walked by. Nobody looked at him if they could help it.

There was a few seconds' peace before it rang again. He picked it up and slammed it back down. On the third ring, he tore the cord out of the receiver and let out a pained cry.\n\nAbove him, Butler stared at the front page of the Daily Mail with a devilish grin.

Unfortunately, below his usual paper was a rag he never recalled subscribing to: Spearhead.

The mental images varied. Blackshirts kicking Butler to a pulp. Butler thrown out of Westminster. So venomous were his thoughts, that when Butler's only action against him upon becoming Prime Minister was a letter from the Revenue Department, he'd laughed at the weakness. It was only once he'd opened the letter that he'd paled, called his wife downstairs and summoned his lawyer.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Fountaine,\" he heard the mousy lawyer reading softly to himself. \"It is our profound regret to inform you that your estate has been found in violation of... a number of stipulations around BPP private donations.\" The man let out an irritating little cough. \"Furthermore, we have found estate revenues...\"\n\nFountaine slammed his fist into the table, causing his lawyer to flinch. \"Did no one ever teach you to read in bloody silence!\" His wife put a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Andrew. Mr. Montgomery, be honest with us. What would happen if we contested this letter?\"\n\nThe lawyer fidgeted slightly, uncomfortable under Fountaine's gaze. \"With Mr. Fountaine as an active MP, it would most likely pass to the House of Lords. Speaking frankly Mr. Fountaine, I think they would rule against you. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Andrew...\" said his wife, gently. \"Perhaps it's time? You've done enough in politics, surely.\" No, he hadn't.

The uprising had left MI5 badly hurt by mass desertions, that much he had already known. Even so, Philby's report had somehow managed to paint an even worse picture of an agency left nearly empty. Shaking his head, he closed the folder, before looking up with an expression of disbelief.\n\n\"I-Thank you for putting this together on such short notice, Philby. Is this truly all the agents we have remaining?\"\n\nPhilby nodded grimly. \"Knight's influence ran deep. On Prime Minister Nall-Cain's orders I've verified the loyalty of those who remained but there weren't many to check. It will take a long time to replace his rats with loyal men.\"\n\nLoyal yes, thought Butler, but loyal to what? Philby had been a fearsome opponent of HMMLR during the uprising, but his family ties to fascist Lords gave Butler pause. Still, he would need the man for dealing with them, nervous as the thought made him. After a brief awkward silence, Butler cleared his throat \"I expect you, I, and Mr. Wilson will be of like mind on that then. MI5 will be far from the only service in need of restructuring. National health, welfare, education...if this havoc has proven anything, it's that our civil service needs to be one we - and more importantly the public - can have confidence in.\"\n\n\"Of course, sir,\" replied Philby, raising an eyebrow curiously. \"I've heard that Mr. Wilson advocates for an end to Aryan civil service. Removing the same policy from MI5 would make replacing our losses easier. It certainly didn't stop traitors the last time around.\"\n\nButler sighed inwardly in relief. Perhaps the man wasn't a fascist after all. Nodding and turning back to the report he missed the shadow of an expression that flitted across Philby's face for a mere instant before vanishing."

After a short explanation of his assignment as Minister of Agriculture, the Prime Minister paused for a response. The Civil Servant thought for a moment to think through his reply.\n\nHe chuckled lightly, \"Well, agriculture was never my specialty but I'm prepared to get my hands dirty. I've already got a few names in mind to act as advisors - this time next week, prepare to have a rural policy report on your desk to read through. We can draft a set of policies that will sap Wallop's base of support whilst at the same time building up a provincial constituency loyal to us.\"\n\nButler sighed in relief, a grin stretching across his face. \"That's reassuring to hear. We cannot rule Britain from Whitehall alone, we'll need both the countryside and the cities under our firm control. The uprising has shown that the trade unions have been a safe haven for radical saboteurs. I assume you have a plan to exorcise this infestation?\"\n\nThe newly assigned minister tensed up at the unexpected question before thinking of a response. \"Ah yes. No need to worry I got it all under control, a white paper is being drafted that shall pacify the workers once and for all.\" Wilson then quickly rose from his seat. \"Well I best be going now, Butler. Those policy papers don't write themselves.\""

The obstructionism of the lords remains a problem, and their shameless corruption is a blight. To that end, I suggest we kill two birds with one stone.\n\nPHILBY: Understood. If I may sir, my office has in the past carried out financial investigations regarding the peerage, at the request of the Prime Minister Domvile as it happens. Certain irregularities were discovered. We were requested to provide the files to the Prime Minister alone, but with him dead we are the only two men who know of them.\n\nBUTLER: Promising. In that case, I want your agents to pursue this line of investigation. Focus on peerage pensions. After my time in the Exchequer I would be more than willing to wager that a number of tax return claims by the Lords are fraudulent. Focus there, and you'll find our dagger against them.\n\nPHILBY: Very well sir.\n\nBUTLER: We will need to tread carefully here Philby, very carefully indeed. I trust all of this information will be obtained discreetly?\n\nPHILBY: Yes, sir. It'll prove harder than it would've before the uprising, given that a number of my agents with connections in the revenue service are traitors or dead. Still, we should be able to avoid involving the Home Office.\n\nBUTLER: Good. Discuss this with no one but your most trusted subordinates. I want our cards kept close to our chest until we're ready to strike."

 butler.11.d:0 "Reckless and foolish, thought Rab Butler to himself, pacing behind his paper-strewn desk. Reckless and foolish both. Still, no matter how he turned it over in his head, he found no other solution. The true danger posed by Wallop was not the man himself, but his array of friends in the Lords whom he could call upon to block anything Butler tried to pass. If he wanted to stand any chance of stopping these fascist lunatics from stopping his plans, then he had to get one of their more powerful friends on his side.\n\nHis musings were interrupted by a knock at the door. Butler opened it, hoping that he looked less worried than he felt. \"Ah Philby, Please, come in. Apologies for the mess, I seem to be somewhat buried in paper these days.\"\n\nPhilby peered over his shoulder at said desk. \"Well, sir, it looks much better than my desk at Leconfield House. Sorting Knight's old papers has been a nightmare. Can add disorganization to the bastard's list of sins.\" He gestured to the chair across from Butler's, \"May I?\"\n\n\"Please,\" Butler replied, \"Though... never mind Knight for now. I had a different, sensitive matter I wanted to discuss.\" Philby quirked an eyebrow at that but nodded. \"If His Majesty's government is to have the trust of his people, it must be one that can be seen to act. Paralysis led us to the uprising and-\"\n\n\"You want me to acquire leverage against the Earl of Portsmouth,\" said Philby, his eyes twinkling at Butler's expression. \"I would be very bad at my job if I hadn't guessed that. But rest assured sir, I serve at the Prime Minister's discretion.\"\n\nButler smiled then, genuinely smiled. The rest of the conversation passed nearly in a blur, with how light and relieved he felt. This time, when he finally rose to show Philby the door, he shook the man's hand, before glancing out at the street below. Perhaps he should go for a walk."

 butler.12.d:0 "Butler was starting to feel the beginnings of a headache coming on. When Reggie and Wilson had come to him in a rare moment of unity to present their proposal for a National Health Service, he should've known it was too good to be true. Any joy he'd gotten from the two men setting aside their endless verbal sniping had evaporated the moment Angus heard the details of the proposal.\n\n\"It's not the principle I disagree with, Prime Minister, god knows I don't.\" said Maude, jabbing his finger at the document for emphasis. \"But we don't have the money for it and that's a fact. Unless Mr. Wilson here wants to conjure it out of thin air, we're making promises to the public here that we simply can't keep.\" The man glared balefully at Wilson.\n\nWilson's lip twitched. \"If Mr. Maude were to carefully review the proposal again, he would see that the numbers do actually add up. I can promise you that Mr. Maudling and I made absolutely sure of that, even if we'll have to borrow to offset the costs.\"\n\n\"By going to Germania and Frankfurt with a begging bowl, asking for change!\" exploded Maude. \"Just how many strings do you think that'll come with, Wilson? Have you thought about that at all? Has Maudling?\"\n\n\"Borrowing in the short term only,\" Wilson replied smoothly. \"And if Angus here wants to go out on the streets and explain public health is something we simply lack the money for, he's welcome to. I'm sure they'll be very sympathetic, after the last two winters we've been through\"\n\n\"You think I don't care? You smug-\"\n\n\"Thank you, both\" said Butler, raising a hand and cutting Maude off. \"Angus, I understand your concerns and share them. Borrowing will come with a price, and I hope that you trust I'm not blind to the risks. But Mr. Wilson is correct, if we are to have any hope at all of surviving another winter, they're risks we'll have to take\""

 butler.13.d:0 "Peter Bishop frowned, adjusting his glasses as he pored over the ridiculous numbers his boss had given him to review yet again. He wasn't sure whether Mr Jenkins was fudging something or really that poor at keeping track of things. Peter couldn't truly find it in himself to be annoyed though, considering the old grocer had given him a job. And for a discharged revenue officer with a bad leg whose only other choice would have been a factory or a mine, that meant the world. Suddenly, he heard the sound of a key turning in a lock, followed by a familiar voice.\n\n\"Peter, love! I'm home!\" called his wife from the entrance. God was it already so late? If Joan was home that meant David ought to be home as well soon. Jenkins and his numbers could wait then. Rising and wincing slightly at the weight it put upon his leg, he limped towards the entrance, greeted by the smiling sight of Joan setting a bag of groceries upon the table, as well as for some odd reason, an opened letter. \n \n\"What's that you've got there, love?\" he said, placing a kiss upon her cheek and giving a curious glance at the letter. \"Thought we were a bit too much of shut-ins for letters these days\".\n\nJoan shook her head, continuing to unload groceries as she did. \"Not for us, silly. For David! You know he's still set on the service.\" Peter grimaced, \"The boy's a damned fool if he is then, Joan. How many times do I have to say it?\"\n\n\"Peter-\" she interjected\n\n\"A damn fool! What, does he think he has some German bastard ready to call him Aryan and wave him in! I love the boy Joan but-\"\n\n\"Peter, they took him\" said his wife, primly before turning back to the bags. For a moment, Peter Bishop simply stood there, unsure of what to feel. Envy. Regret. Grief, for men he had served with, men who the Germans had simply taken, never to be seen again."

 butler.14.d:0 "The buzzing of the Admiralty's old beat-up television set was a common sound in the pub. Normally this would be background noise at best, overshadowed by dockworkers bantering about their wives, their favored teams or the stupid Heer soldiers always goose-stepping around Portsmouth. What was strange about today, however, was that the men were actually paying attention.\n\n\"Oi! Frank. Turn the damn thing up, I can barely hear a word he's saying,\" whined one of the younger dockworkers, only to be met by a scoff from one of the other men.\n\n\"So what? It's always the same shit anyways.\" The other man adopted a mockingly serious expression. \"The gracious trust placed in His Majesty's Government and the BPP has allowed us to triumph over traitors seeking to shackle Britain once more,\" he recited in an imitation of Nall-Cain's drawl. All the same, he did as the man said and turned the TV dial.\n\n\"...and yet some of the blame must be shouldered by His Majesty's government. Had we responded differently to the many trials faced by the British people, the traitors might never have had their lies take root at all. To that end, my government shall oversee an expansion of the civil service, a national health service and the formation of new trade agreements, sanctioned of course by our brothers in the Pakt...\" said Rab Butler, his expression somber. \"Our nation's people have heard enough talk, so I will make the message of my government a simple one. Never again shall our people know hunger, war or strife.\"\n\n\"It sounds good,\" piped up the youngest dockworker again, hopefully. \"Sure, if he delivers,\" said a third man. \"Least he bloody talks about doing something for us. All Domvile ever did was yammer on about unity.\"\n\nA fourth man silently sipping his beer alone said nothing. Butler's words did sound oh so good, traitor that he was. He didn't sneer like Domvile, or bark commands like the Germans that had killed his friends. He didn't look any bit like those monsters. When the deserter listened to the man on the television though, the words were drowned out by a single sound echoing in his ears."

 butler.15.d:0 "\"We're trying sir, we're really trying our best,\" said the Norwich councilor apologetically, sitting down and gesturing at the crowd of curious refugees attracted by the sights of reporters and soldiers. \"There just aren't enough homes to go around sir, we don't have anywhere else to put them\".\n\n\"Something that will, and must change,\" replied Butler firmly, making sure to address the full crowd instead of just the councilor to his right. \"You have my word, sir that my government shall work day and night until each and every person displaced by these terrorists has been housed and provided for.\" The announcement was followed by a flurry of flashes and clicks from the eager cameraman.\n\n\"Mister Butler! Mister Butler!\" cried out a small girl of no more than five, clearly straining to squirm her way through the crowd. Several of the soldiers exchanged looks and one moved to intercept the boy, but was dissuaded by a shaken head from the Prime Minister. The girl was pursued by her mother who made a vain attempt at grabbing her, but she managed to squirm from her mother's grip. \"Mister Butler, Mister Thomas says you're important and you can help mummy-\"\n\n\"Quiet Lucy!\" hissed the girl's mother, before fearfully gazing up at him. \"Sorry for her, Prime Minister, it won't happen again.\" She gave her daughter's arm another tug to no effect.\n\nLucy for her part only pouted back at her \"But they hurt you! He wants to help, why won't you let him mummy?\" Her mother flinched at her daughter's words, recoiling.\n\n\"It's quite alright madam,\" he said, nodding at the still wary woman. \"Young Miss Lucy is very right, we are here to help. We will do all we can to see those who harmed you are brought to justice.\"\n\nThe woman muttered an emotionless thanks, while Lucy beamed by her side, tugging at his sleeve, still talking. \"It was the ones with the funny black shirts sir. With the mean faces.\"\n\nHe had to suppress a grimace at that. Damn you to hell, Fountaine. You and that band of rabid animals. He turned to the woman again, \"All who harmed you, madam. My government holds no tolerance for such atrocities, nor shall it ever.\""

 butler.16.d:0 "The Prime Minister was not the sort of man who frequently found himself at a loss for words. Years upon years of orating desperate appeals to sanity in the commons had done that. Even so, Butler found himself unable to find the right word for the strange but almost pleasant sensation that had followed him today from bed to his breakfast at Downing Street with Maude. The other man seemed to sense something was amiss, giving him a worried look.\n\n\"Something the matter, Prime Minister? If it's Wilson and Maudling, I understand it's concerning, especially so close to the proposal.\" Butler waved a hand dismissively in response, taking a bite of toast as he did.\n\n\"Just lost in thought, Angus. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Maudling's vocal disagreements do concern me but so long as they keep it within cabinet meetings, open discourse ought to be welcomed, not shunned. Particularly on a subject as sensitive as devaluing the pound.\"\n\n\"I would agree, sir,\" replied the chancellor, \"But they aren't. It's beginning to trickle down to the rest of the party, both in the commons and further. The share of the party without a strong opinion in favour of one man is dwindling by the day, the division will only get worse.\"\n\nThe problem, Butler considered, was that both men were clever. Clever enough that if he raised the matter with them directly, they would swear eternal friendship and turn their knives on one another the moment his back was turned. This would require a subtler touch. \"Focus on the proposal for now, but keep an ear to the ground to see if either of them has been reaching out to backbenchers.\" Privately, he doubted either man would be so blatant, but it couldn't hurt. \"Enough of them for now, we'll have to come back to the matter soon enough. More tea?\"\n\nSeveral hours later, long after Maude had left, it finally struck him with a jolt that the feeling had been about Wilson and Maudling after all. Both men clearly had designs on the future direction of the BPP, and a different man might have been nervous that his lieutenants clearly wished to succeed him. As for Rab Butler, he realised he could finally name that strange feeling that he'd carried with him all day."

 butler.17.t:0 "An Honest Day's Work"
 butler.17.d:0 "\"What a ridiculous mess,\" was the only description Butler could conjure, looking at the folders and reports he and Angus had neatly stacked atop his desk together. The stacks themselves were neat enough, all arranged in rows and marked by Angus's neat annotations and circled comments. The welfare system they covered on the other hand, was an utter mess, filled with clauses, conditions and strict rules about which pensions could be collected. His subordinate agreed with him, judging by his look of distaste.\n\n\"It's a byzantine beast of a system, sir, that's the only way to put it. Though that's honestly the point, considering who it's meant to benefit. I've been through the process from top to bottom, and I outright couldn't tell you how to claim a pension sometimes.\"\n\n\"If someone like you couldn't riddle it out, Angus,\" replied Butler, \"I can't imagine how the average person is meant to.\" He tapped a set of papers spread on the left corner of the desk, away from the others. \"I notice military pensions were the only ones that haven't received cuts?\"\n\nMaude nodded. \"Not once since '45. That and property maintenance but I'm sure you remember how delightfully that proposal went.\"\n\n\"I remember,\" sighed Butler. \"What was it Anderson said in the Lords? An attack on their unassailable rights?\"\n\n\"Something like that, sir. Shall we get to work then?\" Butler nodded, and picked up a pen.\n\nBy the time they'd finished, several hours had passed, alongside countless notes, traded witticisms and requests for more tea to his secretary. In spite of the work, Rab Butler genuinely felt as though he'd enjoyed himself. Angus made for good company, and unlike most people in Whitehall, actually understood how a government budget should work. When it was done, he set his pen down and stretched back into his chair. He smiled at Maude."

 butler.18.d:0 "\"A nation cannot survive treason from within. So spoke Cicero, and I think we can all understand the truth of those words after Knight almost destroyed everything we've tried to achieve in saving this country from fascist madmen.\" Said Butler, sipping a glass of whiskey as Maude and Manningham-Buller poured glasses of their own.\n\n\"Words of wisdom Richard, but we've got security affairs well in hand. What's gotten you pouring over the classics?\" Asked Manningham-Buller, watching Butler attentively as he reclined into his armchair.\n\n\"The Duke of Buccleuch, he has to go.\" Butler replied, glancing over to check if Maude was still on-board with what he was about to propose. The steely, determined look in his old friend's eyes confirmed his full support.\n\nSensing something was off, Manningham-Buller set down his glass without drinking from it and looked Butler in the eye. \"That's hardly an objectionable stance, the man's practically a listening device for Wallop, why all the dramatics?\"\n\nButler paused for a moment, biting his lip before at last revealing. \"I'm going to frame him for embezzlement, he'll be cleared in the end of course with it just being slander, but he'll be out of the picture long enough for us to pass our reforms and save this country. I know you're a man of the law but-\"\n\n\"Say no more, he and his friends showed no respect for the law when they ripped up the Parliament Act, I see no reason why the law should respect him.\" Interjected Mannginham-Buller, drawing sighs of relief from Butler and Maude.

 butler.19.d:0 "Walking into Buckingham palace, Butler had grown oddly fond of his meeting with Edward. The man himself was rather unpleasant, who disguised his selfish reasons for collaboration with the allure of some public duty to end the bloodshed. Yet the man was charming enough, and talking with him didn't feel like a constant battle for political dominance as it often was in the current government.\n\nAfter exchanging pleasantries, he sat down with Edward, who eagerly started up conversation on the recent revelations. \"Well, I just couldn't believe it at first, Wallis had to calm me down after I finally accepted it. He had been my friend for decades, a companion in those dark days, for him to do such a thing, of course that must be why I was forced to live in such relatively austere living conditions in the past few years.\"\n\nI'm sure he lived fine enough, Butler thought to himself, taking a sip of tea, a party a week whilst Britannia starved. Edward continued, ignorant to Butler's introspection \"Now, with that frightful matter dealt with, we must turn to who shall succeed him. I had a long list of suggestions, but Wallis and I thought there was only one man really suitable for the role, Robert Row. A good man, respected by the party.\"\n\nButler woke from his introspection, turning to Edward with alarm, Robert Row? A known friend to Wallop's circle of zealots. He would be worse than the mere obstruction of the Duke of Buccleuch, no, it could not be him. Butler calmed himself, before responding \"Whilst Robert would be a fine choice, I was considering Lord Hailes for the position. Patrick is a good man and is liked more by those currently in government. He would be the best fit for the position at this time with political divides so high.\"\n\nEdward thought for a second, before agreeing to Butler's suggestion. After some minor discussions on the economic reforms, the meeting was adjourned, and Butler set off, his mind returning to one thought."

 butler.20.d:0 "Energy, precision and enthusiasm were the first three words that Butler had been able to conjure, listening to Evan Durbin since the minister had entered his office. A refreshing change from Domvile's cabinet, to be sure. He hummed, leaning forward.\n\n\"Very well, Durbin. So, to clarify, while the details will be left to your office, it is the initiative of this government that the Labour office take a greater role in overseeing pay initiatives this following year, as something of a transitory period. I trust you can concoct a suitable preliminary plan by next week?\"\n\nDurbin tapped his pen, thinking. \"Absolutely sir. Am I correct in assuming that this should account for a gradual transition to more local pay management, at the regional and eventually factory level?\"\n\nButler nodded, pleased his minister was catching on. \"Precisely, I'm pleased you understand. So, to confirm. Doable within a week?\"\n\n\"Very, sir. In fact, we could begin by establishing oversight commissions, particularly in the areas of-\"\n\n\"Pardon the interruption,\" cut in Maude, \"But those would be the ones proposed by the Labour office earlier this year, correct?\" Durbin nodded, surprised. \"I see.\" Butler cleared his throat.\n\n\"That'll be all then, I think. Thank you again Durbin.\" After the minister had left, Butler leaned over to Maude.\n\n\"He certainly seemed capable. Was there a reason you asked when the proposals were put together?\" Maude folded his arms.\n\n\"Those were Wilson's ideas. It may have been Durbin speaking, but believe me Prime Minister, I know Wilson's voice when I hear it. No matter who it comes from.\" Butler frowned."

There, she was greeted by a smiling Mary, gave a curt nod to Harold in his drawing room chair and said hello to little Giles. Dinner was at seven, and Rachael sat with the rest of the family around the table. She always sat to the left of Harold, with Mary on the other head of the table. Grace was said, gravy was passed, pleasantries were exchanged. This dinner was a highlight of everyone's week, particularly for Harold and Rachael, who used the distance from Westminster to discuss sensitive matters.\n\n\"I saw Susan earlier today,\" said Rachael, slicing through a roasted potato. \"Durbin's whole office is being run ragged. They get an hour of peace from eight to nine, and then the phones are screaming like—oh, what did she call it...\" She drew a pondering slash across her roast beef. \"...banshees, yes.\"\n\n\"It's Frankfurt, isn't it?\" Harold dabbed away a glob of gravy on his chin.\n\n\"Mm, Germany is what she said. Callers on the phone and in person. Apparently, they're concerned about the new factory pay policies possibly causing a drop in the pound.\"\n\n\"The policies that are meant to be temporary?\"\n\nRachael shrugged.\"Whoever told them must have omitted that part.\" Mary's eyes bounced between the two as if she were at Wimbledon.\n\nHarold sighed. \"Maudling...\" Rachael raised an eyebrow, but did not press it. It made sense. A dinner with foreign dignitaries, a need to impress them, a few glasses of gin too many—suddenly, German investors line up outside Durbin's door to voice their concerns."

They had millions of souls and the high-level organisation of British society to consider, and here they were bickering about council rates.\n\nActually, it was hardly bickering at all. Buller had a smile on his face as he and Lord Chancellor Gerald Gardiner politely disagreed on what day was best for rubbish collection, whether it should be the day before or after the weekly milk delivery. They discussed how council rates should increase, at what rate and by how much per each tax band. They weighed up how much they should invest in local libraries, and whether it might be worth starting up a fleet of vans for a mobile service.\n\nThey involved themselves at every level of local government for a meeting that ran well beyond the hour which it was assigned. They enjoyed every minute of it. It all felt so quaint, dealing with local matters when national ones hung over their heads like an anvil. Only when they discussed the possibility of local elections could they feel the rope which suspended that anvil slip for a brief moment.\n\n\"Well, it has been a while since they had a proper election, hasn't it?\" Gardiner did not specify how long it had been; even now, a wrong date might be read as treason. Nevertheless, the two acknowledged him with a nod of the head. \"Perhaps we could organise them in a few month's time, once we've settled in and they've become used to more sensible rulers.\"\n\n\"I'll leave it with you gentlemen,\" said Butler, rising from his seat. \"Apologies, I have a meeting with Maudling and Maples,\" looking at the clock, \"ten minutes ago. Good day.\" He collected his papers and all but sprinted out of the room, feeling the old pressures mounting again, mourning that he did not have five more minutes to discuss hedgerow notices."

They talked about the morning's events, though there was at first little to report: gossip that Florence and Paul repeated to fill in silence rather than out of any interest.\n\n\"Oh, I overheard something on the radio.\" Florence folded away a new set of towels; their old pair, once hanging on the line one Saturday morning, had been torn by shrapnel from a stray grenade during the civil war, and a new set was long overdue. \"They're saying that there's going to be local elections in a few months' time. The mayor's already talked about not standing for another term.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Paul hummed, putting away the carrots and peas into their new refrigerator. \"Never liked him.

No, no, that's not right. That's not...\" He trailed off; dark thoughts hung over his head like a cloud as he stared into the counter. \"Honey,\" he said, looking up, \"how would you feel if I ran for mayor?\"\n\nFlorence had expected this the moment she heard that broadcast. \"I know you're going to do it anyway, and I don't want to stop you.

BPP strategists and secretaries swarmed him, competing for his time with questions, some petty and some vital. He nodded graciously and said his thanks, he shook hands, he traded jokes and he gave orders. By the time he was done the crowd of well wishers had thinned and he was left with the ones that truly needed his attention.\n\n\"It has been a perilous journey that brought us here, and I would like to thank all of you, for what you have done in the struggle that led us here.\" he said. \"Though there will be reorganizations and great changes in the coming days, the work you have all done will never be forgotten.\" A smattering of tepid applause met his remark, with several of the attendees no doubt wondering which of them would be \"reorganized\". With that, he withdrew into the study, along with Nall-Cain's personal secretary.\n\nTen minutes later, Nall-Cain's personal secretary had been made aware in no uncertain terms who the first reorganization would be. As he left, Butler pulled out a folder full of draft proposals from Angus and began to read. He would be busy all day, he knew, even busier than he'd been as Chancellor, but it was a good sort of busy. The sort, he realized with a start, that had kept him from thinking of Sydney.\n\nEver since he'd lost her four years ago, she'd always haunted his thoughts, like an unwelcome ghost. Whether it was cabinet meetings, bill drafts or yelling matches in the commons, most days he would see something small, be reminded of her and fall into gloomy thoughts of their first days together at Cambridge. Of that lovely day they'd spent together in Vancouver when he'd learned William Mitchell was stepping aside as MP, and he'd first stepped into politics by replacing him, blissfully ignorant of where that would lead.

We are about to see the nation transformed under our leadership, and we must be more skillful now then we ever were in the past.\n\nI have little else to add, my friend, aside from the fact that I will be looking forward to seeing you at the soonest possible moment.\n\nRegards,\nRichard Austen Butler"

 butlerflavour.3.d:0 "To Mr. Harold Wilson,\n\nI congratulate you and the Prime Minister on your recent appointments to His Majesty's Government. I hope you receive this letter in good health and with high spirits for the challenges to come.\n\nMy greatest wish for this new government is that you follow through on your promise to implement universal health coverage for all Britons. It is an initiative that both of us have championed in the House of Commons for years. Were it not for the obstructions of the old guard, a generation of decent citizens would have no need to suffer the predations of profit-seeking healthcare providers and the debt their services incur.\n\nNevertheless, I remain concerned about other initiatives that you and the Prime Minister have been proposing. The British People's Party was meant to promote the public health and welfare of the British people. Initiatives such as those recommended in the Beveridge Report advance this noble goal. Beyond this, your attempts to insert politics into people's homes and lives under the guise of \"democratisation\" risks bringing the fractious conflict our singular, holistic party was meant to end.\n\nIt is our role to meet the needs of the British people without burdening them with a further need to engage in the political sphere; I fear that Butler's wounds will re-open the old wounds of divisive partisanship we were meant to resolve.\n\nI hope you consider these words with the importance they deserve, and I implore you to contact me should you wish to discuss these matters in further detail.\n\nRegards,"

So long as Britain remains in the hands of those whose eyes can look towards the future, I can live with it.\n\nAll that being said, I must urge you to temper your pragmatic concerns with a clear-eyed hope for what this country's future ought to be. You and Butler, you've been handed the till, and it's your responsibility to steer the ship of state.

 fountaine.1.d:0 "\"Your Majesty, it is my most heartfelt desire that you allow me to form a government. As you know, the Party is behind me fully, and any government of mine will make certain to respect the monarchy and all its rights.\"\n\nSo Fountaine said, but Edward was decidedly certain that he was being dishonest. He knew full well of Fountaine's rhetoric regarding the old aristocracy's influence in politics, and he saw no reason to believe that it didn't extend to the monarchy as well. In addition, the push against the party's old guard and pragmatists deeply concerned him, and he was fairly sure that it was a prelude to further power grabs. However, there was little he could do, save for attempt to influence his government into better policies - provided they were even willing to listen.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I must insist on receiving an answer today. Britain is ailing from the war and years of decay beforehand, and we need a strong, united government to face it.\"\n\nThis response jolted Edward forcibly out of his speculative reverie, and he was able to respond in kind fairly quickly.\n\n\"Very well, Fountaine, but I must insist that your government takes a far less combative tone regarding the upper class, and that you begin to reconcile with the other elements of the Party.\"\n\n\"Of course, your Majesty. I have never intended to upset the natural order of things in Britain, and the disunity of the Party certainly was not my doing. You have my word that your wishes will be respected when I am Prime Minister.\"\n\nEdward nodded, and gave his assent to forming a government, but he did not have faith in Fountaine's promises at all. He would have preferred virtually anyone else to have gained control over the BPP, and he knew that when Fountaine was Prime Minister, he could do nothing against him."
 fountaine.1.a:0 "Empty promises are readily discarded."
 fountaine.2.t:0 "An End to Liberalism"
 fountaine.2.d:0 "The response of the Pragmatists of the BPP to Fountaine's gaining power over the government was near-universal horror.\n\nSome tried to hurriedly break ranks to the Ideologues, stressing a newfound desire to aid in the development of a Fascist Britain. Some were accepted into the new order, most weren't.\n\nOthers simply left the Party, becoming independents in Parliament and cutting all ties with their old fascist \"allies\".\n\nAnd finally some simply hoped to stay on in the BPP as Pragmatists despite the new government, but were quickly shown the error of their ways by being ejected from the ranks of the Party regardless.\n\nAs these hammer blows fell, one after the other, on the ranks of the Pragmatists, Rab Butler convened a private meeting with Harold Wilson and Reginald Maudling.\n\n\"I... don't really know what to say, gentlemen. I simply cannot continue leading our faction under these circumstances. In fact, I think if I did stay, Fountaine would find some way to put me in prison for it. I have to leave Parliament. It will be for you, Reggie, and you, Harold, to lead whatever the fascists leave intact of our group.\"\n\nDejected, Butler paused for some time as the weight of the responsibility he had placed on the other two men sank in. He finally began to speak again, in a crushed, quiet voice.\n\n\"When I agreed to work with the Germans and join the BPP, I thought I was helping save Britain from fascism. I thought if I worked from inside against the fascists, I would be able to bring back democracy over time and restore Britain as it was.\"\n\nHe did not continue, and neither did the two respond. They didn't need to. All three were now certain of one thing - it was all for nothing."

The Prime Minister sets policy, and the Civil Service executes it to the best of their ability. The only reason this meeting was called at all is because we have already begun to notice a disgusting - perhaps even treacherous - lack of loyalty when it comes to enforcing the most basic edicts of this government.\" Fountaine had been carrying on in this vein for quite some time, and the seniormost undersecretaries and heads of the emergency services were watching him with a mixture of concealed dread and resentment. He then paused, allowing whatever responses they could make to his rant.\n\nOne of the braver undersecretaries said, \"We have just survived a major uprising, sir, and our capabilities are strained as they are. How can we be expected to implement your policies when we can barely administer the country as it is?\"\n\nFountaine had been expecting - perhaps even hoping - for this response, and immediately began with his own. \"The reason that this administration is weak and incapable is due to a lack of Fascist policy, and its capabilities will never improve without its implementation. I know as well as you do that there are very few men in this room who would consider themselves fascists, and that does not matter. You will implement my policy in just the way I want it, with the zeal of any Blackshirt, or...\"\n\nHe then gave a nod to Jeffrey Hamm, the Blackshirt commander who had been previously observing the meeting quietly. Hamm was a far more brutal, less refined public speaker than Fountaine, but that did not matter for his planned message. \"Let me be short and blunt, gentlemen. I already know where most of you live, and my Blackshirts will find out the locations of those who I don't. You will follow our orders, or pay.\""
 fountaine.3.a:0 "The civil servants will comply, whether it be through loyalty, or through fear."
 fountaine.4.t:0 "The Great Orchestra"
 fountaine.4.d:0 "The BPP campaign office was abuzz with noise, the sounds of ringing telephones, rustling papers and rapid conversations nearly drowning out all else. Office workers ran from room to room, passing notes and messages, while Blackshirts and temporary workers rushed around the office bearing posters, leaflets and flyers, while artists sketched design after design. The office was so chaotic it seemed almost impossible to coordinate, impossible for all except the conductor at its center, now overlooking a poster design with a disapproving expression.\n\n\"Not this one,\" said John Bean, pushing the concept paper away in disappointment. \"Too repetitive and far too generic. The point is to focus on today's issues, not an uprising already crushed.\" He pointed towards the Heer soldier on the right of the poster, marching hand in hand with a British one, \"This goes for all of you, less soldiers in everything. Our purpose here is to offer an alternative to Bolshevism. So focus on the worker, not the soldier.\" He stalked off, muttering to himself.\n\nDistribution was equally frustrating. \"As protection\", he scolded, speaking carefully to the Blackshirt commanders as though to very slow children. \"It's simple, the paid workers put up the posters, and you protect them. We want local communities involved in distribution, not outsiders marching in.\" The commanders glowered at him, clearly resenting his authority. All the same, he knew they would obey. He dismissed them with a snap of his fingers. \"Go on now, get your people in line.\"\n\nBroadcasting for its part, fared much better than design or distribution. In a number of rooms, radio personalities stood before microphones, reciting lines. It had been Bean's own idea to massively expand up the BPP's presence on the airwaves. Television would mostly reach upper class families, and posters, while a start, were not enough. A combined constant presence of posters and radio though, was a step in the right direction. So long as Britain's workers saw their message everywhere, Bean knew it would inevitably sink in."

 fountaine.5.d:0 "Every man had his element where he felt most comfortable, and for Andrew Fountaine that was in front of a camera or behind a microphone. The sheer invigorating power of being able to whip men into a frenzy, or inspire them to root out degeneracy with just a word was intoxicating. He could barely keep the smile off his face as the camera was wheeled before his desk. Taking a deep gulp of water, he sat down, nodded to the camera crew and looked straight into the lens.\n\n\"Good morning, People of Britain. I am speaking to you now not as your Prime Minister, but as a Briton who loves his country. For decades, you have been threatened by uprisings, by terrorists, Jews, and communists. We live in a period where you have been bombed, terrorized, shot at. No more. Hand in hand with our European brothers, we will march forward into a new, glorious future. A Fascist future, free of degeneracy and terror. When the history of our island is written, they will speak of today as the first day of a new dawn. The Fascist revolution begins today!\"\n\nCountless ears would hear Fountaine's words, broadcasted through every television in Britain. Blackshirts cheered the pronouncement from their barracks, saluting the television with utter zeal. Fountaine's MP's toasted and spoke of new times coming, of a great revolution long overdue. The nearly leaderless former Pragmatist MP's watched their screens in horror, unable to look away.\n\nFor those less connected to the byzantine world of Whitehall politics, the broadcast drew a more mixed response. Some murmured of how at least the government was now taking action, even if the Home Secretary turned Prime Minister seemed a little intense. Others muttered fearfully of what the word \"revolution\" might mean, gesturing at the ever larger masses of blackshirts and propaganda in the streets. The few non-British still living in Britain were more frightened still, wondering just whether Fountaine might cast his gaze on them next. Whatever they felt, one thing was certain."
 fountaine.5.a:0 "All of Britain would feel Fountaine's will."
 fountaine.6.t:0 "All The Devils Are Here"
 fountaine.6.d:0 "Looking up at him from down below, Harold Wilson was struck by the thought that Fountaine looked more like a self-important medieval despot than anything else. The Prime Minister had perched himself high up above in the gallery of the Commons, his face bearing a smug grin as he looked down on the MP currently speaking. Kingswood, Wilson remembered. An Ideologue to the core, a toady and a bootlicker who'd jumped ship from Chesterton to Fountaine in '56.\n\n\"...it amazes me, honorable members, how members of our very own party can stand in defense of such blatantly anti-British propaganda. It corrupts the youth with self-hatred and noxious ideologies, and leads them to hate themselves, their country and take up the cause of terror.\" Kingswood finished his speech with a flourish, before sitting back down. The Speaker nodded, turning over to Wilson. He knew how this would end, yet he had to try. Steeling himself, he rose.\n\n\"I would like to begin by thanking the right honorable member from West Dorset for his service\" he said, sardonically.\n\nKingswood stared at him, confused. \"What are you rambling about, man?\" Wilson ignored him, continuing.\n\n\"Just as our brave soldiers did during the Uprising, he tries his hardest to defend our youth. My only question is this, to defend them from what? The threat to Britain's youth comes from real and threatening Resistance elements, not from vaguely defined 'Anti British Materials.' Is the right honorable member proposing to defend us from children's books? From Punch and Judy?\" He sat back down, a series of snickers following from all around the room. Kingswood's face turned red.\n\nIt didn't change anything of course. It hadn't mattered at all. He could verbally out-spar men like Kingswood all he liked, but when the Speaker asked for those in support of the bill to rise, the BPP MP's all rose from their benches as one, Kingswood glaring at Wilson as he did. As the Speaker announced the passing of the bill, he felt a stirring of fear in his chest."

 fountaine.7.t:0 "Daggers in the Sheath"
 fountaine.7.d:0 "\"You know, gentlemen, I've been meaning to have this meeting for a while now. We should have been sitting here weeks ago.\" Fountaine had the energy and impatience within him to bark at the two men for hours. He wouldn't, his throat would be sore for the rest of the week and he had several speeches to perform. If there was any week to not kill his voice for, it would be this one.\n\n\"This... I don't even know what to call it. Powerbuilding between you two? It is a sign of weakness to the entire world. You are lucky none of your screaming matches have leaked to either the Reich or, hell, even the Judeo-Bolshevik infiltrators still running amuck here. Germany hears of any of this? The revolution will be a homicide case, and the blood will be on your hands.\"\n\n\"And to be completely honest, we shouldn't be sitting here in the first place. We are here to help Britain embrace a revolution, the likes of which the world has not seen in decades. Nobody in our ministry needs this petty squabbling between you two, when we have a job to do.\"\n\nJeffrey Hamm combed his hair back with his hand. Despite all of that Bolshevik and capitalistic nonsense that Bean might've been throwing at the Prime Minister, the revolution must stand united. And Germany? God, if they had ever found out, every member of the British People's Party would find their head in a noose and all because of a vulgar argument between two ministers? [GER.GetLeader] would surely try all of them for treason. To be completely honest, he would have a fair reason to do so.\n\nJohn Bean scratched his cheek. Hamm, with all his flaws, was a very simple and blunt man. At this point, anybody would have to accept it, yet Bean hadn't. It was clear that the man was very narrow minded and he would also have to accept that. The revolution's implementation is more important than anything else, and he would have to compromise to achieve victory for Britain.\n\n\"Are we ready, gentlemen?\" Both ministers shook their heads in agreement. Fountaine's stress cleared as this was possibly the shortest meeting a Prime Minister could ever hope for."

Scattered amongst these fanatics was a police officer who, officially speaking, was there to maintain public order - although in reality, it was to protect the public from their excesses. Suddenly, all went quiet as the man of the hour arrived to deliver his speech.\n\nJeffrey Hamm marched to the podium, clearing his throat. \"It is a privilege for me to speak to so many of you here today,\" he began. \"To be surrounded by so many great men who, instead of asking what they can take from their country, instead asked themselves what they could give. It fills me with such pride, truly. For you men have sacrificed so much to carry the torch of British civilization. With this torch, we shall set alight all those who seek to corrupt the soul of our great people. We are the first line of defence against degeneracy. Let us today proudly rejoice in being the vanguard of fascism!\"\n\nA deafening cheer erupted from the crowd, as almost everyone was swept up in Hamm's words. All save for one.\n\nThe police officer felt a cold sweat descend upon him, as Hamm spoke. It was like watching a car crash in slow-motion; these thugs were going to get many, many innocent people killed, and there was nothing he could do about it. The moment of opportunity had long since passed when the uprising was put down. The man's conscience ate at him for not defecting to HMMLR when had the chance.

Adjusting his Fiddler's cap, something caught his eye as he turned the corner.\n\nWhy should he have been surprised - nothing but the usual. A poster, marked by the infamous flash and circle that adorned anything the Fountaine ministry would publish. Bolded letters encapsulated the outlining of the piece, THE COMMON MAN WORKS FOR A FUTURE, WHY NOT WORK TOWARDS A BETTER ONE? WORK FOR THE GLORY OF BRITAIN AND WORK FOR THE FASCIST REVOLUTION!\n\nIan scoffed at the idea of the poster. Why in God's name would any worker with an ounce of common sense want to work with this Nazi collaborator government? This notion that any worker would be interested and affected by this propaganda nauseated him. He would look over to some of his colleagues, only to see blank expressions. Ian knew them well-enough that most of these men were mentally blocking the propaganda from their mind, something that Ian could never do. However, horror soon filled his eyes as he looked further in the back.\n\nYounger workers butted shoulders and pointed at the posters. Ian looked in their eyes, these interactions weren't the point-and-laugh type. These young boys, not knowing any better, are intrigued by this. The eyes of almost all of them had a certain shine to them, which to Ian was enough to ruin his day. Eyes turned forward. Don't think about it. These posters wouldn't affect that many. There's only one. Surely there isn't more.\n\nHe should have known better. The posters, and mostly the same one at that, lined the walls for the entire way down to the factory he laboured for.

Not a single man had dared to ask the reason for their presence at the proceedings, and none of the five seemed to be volunteering an answer.\n\nThe Speaker cleared his throat. \"Honored members of Parliament, the Secretary of State for Justice has the floor. Please save all discussion until the Secretary has concluded reading out his proposal.\"\n\nThe minister nearly jumped in his eagerness to stand. \"Thank you Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, without the valiant service of the Blackshirts, how many of you could have been strung up or shot by some would-be partisan? To ensure our continued protection and that of all Britain, the Security Services Reinforcement Act will incorporate the Blackshirts as a formal security service akin to the British Free Corps, with all the legal powers associated.\"\n\nA roar of cheers from the BPP members met the declaration, while the Independents sat silently in fear, unwilling to say a word. \"If there are no opposing points of discussion\" said the Speaker, \"we will proceed to-\"\n\n\"This is an abomination!\" cried out an Independent, lurching to his feet defiantly. \"Be silent!\" bellowed a BPP MP in response but the man shook his head, refusing to be cowed.\n\n\"Andrew Fountaine claims to love Britain, and yet he would deliver her into the hands of men who are scarcely better than the traitors. How can any of you, any of you vote for such a bill in good conscience knowing what these - I will not call them men did in Cornwall? In Edinburgh?

A moment later, Jeffrey Hamm entered, his secretary hastily moving out of the man's way.\n\n\"It's done, sir. They'll do as they're told. A few of them were louder than others, so we made examples.\"\n\nFountaine smirked as he listened, looking out at all the figures milling about in the street below. Bureaucrats, civil servants and MP's alike, all so used to being insulated. Amusing how easily that illusion could be shattered by one man with a truncheon. He cleared his throat and turned away from the window.\n\n\"How many demonstrations did you need? We'll need to draw up replacement candidates, and soon\"\n\n\"Three\", answered Hamm. \"The rest understood the message after that. Some resignations, but most accepted. They've lost any wing to cower under, and they know better than to go to the police\"\n\nThree.

However, like two kids in a candy show, they could not help themselves.\n\nBean, still swallowing his last piece of toast, interrupted the small talk that introduces any political meeting. \"Gentlemen, gentlemen, that meal surely was stupendous, and thank you Prime Minister.

They were all about European Fascism and the many forms it took, but each and every one of them told him the exact same story - division, infighting, squabbling over the pettiest reasons. And when their central authority collapsed, so too did their regime. For a system that had won the Second World War, the decline had set in quickly. Flicking his eyes to one of the newspapers reporting on the crises in Eastern Europe was enough to reinforce that for Bean.\n\nSomething was rotten in those systems. It was an artificial unity if their leader was removed it all went to hell. As Bean rose his pen, to take another note, he glanced out the window over London's dark and deary streets. The fallout of the uprising was visible everywhere. An uprising that had been caused by more than the sudden absence of Germany. No... it was much more than that.\n\nBrushing the stacks of paper aside, Bean stared at an old diagram of the organization of the NSDAP. All power flowed down, from the Führer to the nation. The same applied with the PNF, all power flowing from the Duce. Bean paused, before grabbing a transcript of the old announcement of surrender. Flipping it over he began to sketch something out. Power depriving from the nation, a bottom-up national development. A new fascism, a new light to shine from Europe, a new model for the world.\n\nBean rose from his seat and walked over to the window.

Then, the BFC came.\n\nIt was over, Graham reminded himself, his hands shaking as he held the oven door open to pull out a tray. After a terrifying full month of BFC patrols, they had left as soon as they'd come, leaving terror and broken bones in their wake. If one was lucky. The shop door bell rang, causing him to sit down and turn around to see two unfamiliar men in black uniforms. Blackshirts.\n\n\"Can I help you, gentlemen?\" he asked politely, trying his best not to stammer. The men ignored him, with one lazily picking up his mug of tea and taking a satisfied gulp. He felt an instinctive surge of anger, \"Put that-\" Before he could react, the other Blackshirt grabbed him by the collar and slammed him into the counter face first, causing him to taste blood. He writhed, but the other man's grip was iron. He heard the sound of his mug being flung against the ground and shattering.\n\n\"Tell you what mate, I think you can,\" he heard the first Blackshirt say in a smug voice. \"There's a girl who comes through here in the morning. Some of the boys say she took care of traitor rats when they held this place. That true?\"\n\nMaisie, he thought. Ted's girl. \"I'm sorry, I don't kn-\"\n\nHe was cut off by a baton to the head, causing him to nearly see stars. \"I don't know! I don't know!\" he cried, whimpering. He felt himself being let go, and collapsed to the ground in a heap.\n\n\"Useless bastard,\" said the other man. And with that they left, leaving Graham alone, clutching his bleeding nose and weeping."

Exactly what he wanted by making such a comment. Fountaine would rest his hand against hand. This song and dance would happen too often for his liking.\n\nBean perked up at Hamm's comment when nobody else could. \"I would be very careful about just shouting such a statement around. They are nothing like what we just fought against in the uprising. None of them are outright socialists like many of the regional leaders in the urban areas were. They were just misinformed and led by the wrong influences like Beckett and Wallop.\"\n\nHamm laughed, humourlessly, a bitter smirk on his face. \"Yes, and you would surely know a thing or two about being an outright socialist, wouldn't you?\" Bean bit his tongue. Such comments from Hamm were the norm, unfortunately. \"The men who led us in the past were not who we needed to lead a nation,\" Hamm continued. \"That is why we had several rebellions against the government under their leadership.\"\n\nEyes in the room all closed in on Bean, who took a deep breath. \"A Judeo-Bolshevik and capitalistic mentality was going to form within the Resistance no matter what. It would not matter if the American infiltrators were there or not to influence them, there would be heavy resistance against a Fascist Britain. Most of the major figures of such resistance have been executed or prosecuted and now we can truly enforce our vision; something no previous leader of the British People's Party has ever really had.\"\n\n\"I'm unsure you understand the situation, John. They lead us to failure. Who would want to remember the failures in Britain when we are truly a perfect people?

 fountaine.16.d:0 "Fountaine and his Chancellor John Bean formed the British Workers' Alliance only last night. The first time I heard of this was in the morning papers this morning. It was a little bit of a rough awakening on my part, never expecting anything from Fountaine. They said to be there at 7 o'clock at night, and hopefully about 750 thousand others would be there to accompany you. Unlike most other things, they were not lying.\n\nThe crowd was packed, and I mean packed. It was surely over the estimated number the government gave. Hell, I even had a hard time parking my BMW. Mine is small, and even with that I couldn't find a good spot.\n\nI was surprised when I saw the flame that burned in the union leader's eyes. I think it was something like Ted Budden. There is something special behind them. Personally I was expecting some 70 year old man that could barely spit out a sentence. But no, he was flailing his arms all around trying to punctuate his words with them. And that beaming smile, I'd never seen nothing like it.\n\nThe massive wave of people somehow respected the guy too. I guess Bean is doing some real work to reel these people in. And to say the least, it showed. There were posters everywhere surrounding Budden's podium, the wall behind him had a massive flash and circle, which was also on the podium itself if I remember correctly. With the bloke's flamboyant energy and the massive amount of BPP imagery, you could say it was a rally and you wouldn't be too far off. Budden was also throwing insults at the other workers somehow without being reprimanded for it. He said some things about there were caveats to being enrolled within the program and if those are broken that all of us would be powerless. Again do not expect anything from Fountaine.\n\nAt this point, it just seems like my job as a factory worker has been used as a tool for the state to bully its enemies out of relevance. I go to work almost everyday of the week to give myself and hopefully down the line my relatives stability. But now what? I go to work almost everyday to serve my country? I am not a soldier, and under this government, I refuse to be.\n\nIan placed his pen to the side of his desk, put the journal underneath his dresser and slammed himself against his bed."

Such hopes were ripped asunder by the horrors of the war and what came after, as fascism seized power. Yet until recently, the BFC has overshadowed their older companion as the monster under the bed to look out for. But with the coming of Fountaine, it seems that the Blackshirts have begun to retake the streets they once terrorised.\n\nTheir pervasive gaze observes everything. Their boots can perpetually be heard marching through alleyways. They are engaged in constant brawls and street-fights, intent on crushing the last few sparks of resistance. Their terror is not limited to these old British cities - across the fields of the old countryside, roaming gangs of Blackshirts terrorise small villages and towns suspected of harbouring HMMLR remnants.\n\nOne man is pleased with this terror. Jeffrey Hamm looks upon his minions' doings and finds himself happy with them. Mosley would be proud of his most faithful acolyte - transforming the Blackshirts from a gang of thugs into the arm of BPP was an achievement many could only ever dream of doing, and he had made it a reality. Let Bean complain all he wanted - for there was precious little he could do to stop them."

A little like the conquering hero returning home. After all, Britain was all his now. No more simpering \"Yes, Prime Minister\" at relics like Domvile and Nall-Cain. No more hand-wringing and whining from that resistance rat loving Butler about \"injustice\" every time he fucking breathed. With them gone and out of the way though, he had an even bigger challenge ahead. An entire country that needed a real, strong Fascist vision, one that would need to be rebuilt from the ground up. One moment of weakness or failure and he could go the way of Chesterton. \n\n\"What is it, dear?\" asked Rosemary. He turned away from her and looked out the window, absentmindedly drumming his fingers on his thigh. \n\n\"It's nothing. Have the staff start making breakfast, would you?

Everything was just as he'd left it, down to the portrait of his father in his Vice-Admiral's uniform. He wondered if his father had ever felt half so lost at sea as Andrew Fountaine felt right now. He'd always been a speaker and a doer, he felt at home at a rally, or working in the Home Office to root out enemies. Ideological visionary screeds and plans for the future of shaping Britain were the kind of thing he'd left to John, or to Hamm.

Most of my colleagues preferred the meetings indoors, but you preferred to go to the streets, meeting and speaking to as many people as you could. That, I suppose, is one of your greatest strengths. But as you spoke out against Bolshevik influence to a crowd of shopkeepers and artisans, I could not help but remember that perhaps fifty kilometres east was the city of Manchester, where Jack Jones would fire his first shot three years later.\n\nManchester is a working man's city, and it was the alienation of the working man that sparked the fires which twice lit that city aflame. It was their frustrations, which went unheeded by our government for so long, that drove them into the hands of the Bolsheviks. No amount of speeches or rhetoric can fill a man's stomach and keep him warm through the winter.\n\nIf there is any lesson which I can impart to you, let it be this: the government cannot afford to speak over the problems of labour any longer. Though our previous government was divided and slow to act when it mattered, it is now your responsibility in a more united government to address these problems. Listen to the workers, hear their concerns, and do your utmost best to meet them. Our failure to address their needs caused two uprisings. I fear that we may not survive a third.\n\nTake care,"

Of course, he would never see the few pages Fountaine had removed from it, the true cost of \"anti-partisan\" activities buried forever alongside their innocent victims.\n\n\"I must also add Prime Minister, that these results are by no means concrete yet. We require a further enhanced security apparatus and continued operations to root out the last traitors and prevent their return. I and many within the Party are in agreement on this, but I fear that some of our colleagues are too hesitant to strike the killing blow required.\" Fountaine added in a not-so subtle jab at his rival.\n\nNall-Cain nodded in agreement, sighing as he closed the folder. \"I share your concerns, Butler and his lot mean well and he's a damn fine Chancellor, but I do worry about some of his security proposals. He's far too... soft on these terrorists.\"\n\nSeeing the window of opportunity open wide, Fountaine leapt into it. \"Prime Minister, as long as I remain a member of this government, I will not allow Britain to fall to Judeo-Bolshevik insurgents.

Nothing but tea, biscuits and a vital front in the war for Britain's soul.\n\n\"Look, Mr Butler, a lot of us would quite frankly prefer you to win over that glorified thug Fountaine, but you must admit that many of your proposed reforms have made us... uneasy. Must you strip our power in such a way?\" one of the Lords present asked, a leader in the moderate faction Butler had to court if he wanted to win once Domvile kicked the bucket.\n\n\"I recognise that you all may have some... Trepidation, about my proposed reforms, but please my Lords, they are vital to restoring our people's trust in us and faith in Parliament. You will still have the powers of delay and amendment, and whilst not as strong as an outright veto, they are still powerful, and more than enough to check the Commons if they do something stupid, as quite a few of my fellow MPs so often wont to do.\"\n\nThe joke went down well with the Lords, who seemed to be warming to Butler's idea. Seeing his opportunity to secure their support and turn them against Fountaine for good, Butler struck whilst the iron was hot. \"Do take for instance, some of the proposals brought forth by some of Fountaine's gang recently. That Bean fellow sounds almost like a communist in his rhetoric. Not that the others sound less moronic mind you, the other fellow, Hamm, was going on about the need for a \"Syndicalist economy\" too, with quite alarming implications for our social status quo.\"\n\nThe Lords nodded in agreement, with the Peer who spoke before raising his voice again. \"I think I speak for us all when I say it is better to give away some power to decent chaps than risk it all on some unpredictable louts, very well Mr Butler, you have our support.\""

Rest assured that my eye is firmly on our fiscal state following this report.\" Nall-Cain replied, turning over page after page of Butler's detailed report with growing concern, but also resolving to fix this mess. The report had been brutally honest and left Nall-Cain to no illusions as to Britain's fragile state.\n\n\"It is my view, and that of the Treasury, that we need a carefully considered, balanced economic programme to stimulate growth and recovery of our broken infrastructure by courting investment from our Pakt allies.

That was another thing that had returned in full swing from the last war she thought; the black market.\n\nSatisfied with their legitimacy, the grocer stuffed the coupons in his pocket and began to rummage around the grouping of crates at his feet, picking out the precise amount of food as dictated by the rations. One by one, memories of waiting patiently for her mother to return with the shopping as Home Guard and ARP Wardens kept watch came trickling back, but that was another war, and another Britain.\n\nLooking to the side, she was reminded just how much Britain had changed. Instead of Home Guard and Police keeping a reassuring eye on things, there was instead a gang of BFC thugs lurking in the corner, the Police clutching their firearms with a wary look in their eyes. And if all that wasn't enough, the Swastika flying high from the town hall, repurposed into a Garrison HQ and yet to be returned, reminded everyone whose boot their necks rested under \"There you are ma'am, good day to you.\" The grocer said, handing over Mary's shopping and snapping her out of her reverie.\n\nAccepting the bag with a simple \"Thank you,\" she began the long walk back home, left alone with her thoughts and fears for the future.

Its streets, once busy and full of laughter, had nearly no people walking them now. Buildings lay in disrepair, with collapsed roofs and holes visible even from his high vantage point.\n\nThe Earl was no stranger to devastation, the horrors he had witnessed in the fields of Verdun and Neuve-Chapelle would remain with him forever. To see it inflicted on England's green beauty though, disturbed him more than he could say. This is why you fight, he reminded himself. He could not simply sit by and watch as the Jew and the Socialist tore nations apart to their very soil, time and time again. At times the struggle seemed futile, and yet it was a struggle worth fighting.\n\n\"Sir? Shall I inform the Mayor you'll be delayed?\" asked a bodyguard. Wallop waved a hand, dismissively.\n\n\"No need. Wait by the car for now.\" The bodyguard nodded, leaving him to his thoughts and the barren view. Not entirely barren though, mused Wallop. Far down below, near the docks, a few fishermen were still preparing their boats, loading rods, fuel drums and satchels. Come what may, men of English character gathered up their tools and got to work. And now that the parasites had tipped their hand too early with the uprising, England's people would be free to. All they would need was a stern guiding hand in Downing Street. When his colleagues had suggested the thought thirty years ago, he'd snorted bitterly, dismissing it as an impossibility. But now?

 postcw.25.d:0 "Maxwell Knight limped through each hallway followed by the few soldiers left of the resistance. The soldier in front of Knight barged through each door, as a courtesy for his leader. The former head of MI5 panted harder than he had ever. He recognized the hallways from decades ago, hoping the man in front of him did as well.\n\nBoth became frantically searched the facility as it quickly became a maze, \"where in the fuck was this bloody bunker?\" His eyes darted across each corridor, still with his limp dragging him down. \"Where is it? Perhaps I can find a supply closet. But surely they would find me, right?\" He thought again, \"It's too late to survive them, I just need to outlast them.\"\n\nAfter getting through a few more doors and dodging the inevitable bullets that rang through each hall, he found it. The supply closet. Knight weaved himself away from the colonel that led him, slamming against the door and desperately gripping the doorknob. He pulled, it wouldn't budge. He shouted a curse, and tried again, pressing against the door as hard as the old Knight could. Nothing. Knight shuffled through the belt of a fallen comrade at his feet, trying to find a combat knife. Accidently scratching his finger on the blade he scrambled to chop off the hinges.\n\nHe froze after hearing another gunshot, followed by what sounded like thousands screaming, then more. His panting started to grow faster. Knight turned his attention back to the door. He had destroyed the internal workings of the lock, sneaking his way into the room. The screams grew louder and the gunshots grew faster. Minutes passed, now Knight heard boots slamming against the metal floor and Englishmen shouting. Knight could now feel sweat dripping off of him. A final solution came into his head. He should kill himself. Yeah, that's the way. He placed his thumb on the back of his pistol, and slid it out of its holster. He panted faster. \"I can't... I can't.\" He threw the weapon across the room, banging against the wall."

His bloodshot eyes glanced back to the door, it opened slightly and the interrogator came in. They both stared at each other for a moment, then looked down to the military baton the interrogator held.\n\nKnight was tired of the song and dance the Collaborators put him through, being a veteran of the Great War made you experience things nobody wants to. It was too late however, he needed one last goodbye. Something to truly show the Collaborators what they were truly worth. The dirt on the bottom of his shoe. He created the perfect lie and stuck with it.\n\nThe man approached Knight, tightening the grip around the weapon. \"Do you have anything to say, you cunt?\" Knight sighed, but the man struck him in the stomach, forcing out some blood from his throat. The man shouted at Knight to speak up, complying he responded, his voice a mere rasp. \"Please... a name. I can give you a name. Please...\" \"You won't have anything good to say to spit it out, you filthy snake.\" He regenerated his voice after a solid minute of panting, \"There's a man... a mole. One of mine.\" He coughed, \"His name is Joyce. William Joyce..\""

 postcw.27.d:0 "All eyes were on Maxwell Knight. The tension in the courtroom was thick enough that it could be cut with a butter knife. The man who orchestrated the uprising just stood there, hands cuffed together and his expression carefully schooled blank. The trial had been entirely for show, as expected. His defence was a paper-thin argument that he had acted according to his own apparent 'misguided ideals' and that he 'deserved to live with what he had done.'\n\nThe rest of the trial had been much less fair. Everything from the most inconsequential of lies to the worst of the war crimes committed by the resistance was attributed to him. When those present in court would discuss what they had seen, they claimed that his expression had not changed even slightly as his list of crimes was read aloud to him. Eventually, the time came for him to be called to the stand. \"Mr Knight,\" began the barrister, walking confidently across the floor. \"Your crimes have already been made evident to the jury. Your guilt is self-admitted. Tell me, now that you know what you have done to your country, what do you have to say for yourself?\"\n\nA beat passed, and Knight stroked his chin thoughtfully. \"The words do not come easily, I must say. What does a condemned man have to say to his condemners? My fate was determined the moment I was captured. But since you are all so keen to hear what I have to say - and I know that everything I say will be recorded - so I to the men running this new government, I say this.\"\n\nHe leaned forwards, looking the prosecutor dead in the eye. \"I have worked amongst you for years. I know everything about you. Your deepest secrets and your worst nightmares. And I know how utterly venal and blackened your souls are. Each and every one of you Nazi-loving bastards is a traitor to this country. You have failed Britain and her people. And while I may be long dead before your house of cards falls in on itself, that day will come.\" The former head of MI5 leaned backwards in his chair, a viscous smile on his face. \"Oh, it will come.

NO-\"\n\nThe sound of a trap door opening abruptly silenced William Joyce's screams, echoing all the way to the cell in which Knight was being kept. He smiled grimly. At least one good thing had come of this. 'Lord Haw Haw' was one person that the world would definitely be better off without, that was for certain. If only he had been salient enough to name a few more of those pigs when he was stretched across the rack, but beggars could not be choosers.\n\nHis cell door swung open, light flooding into the cell. Two guards stood at the entrance, and Knight knew that his time had come. \"Is it time already, gentlemen?\" He asked, getting up and allowing them to tie his hands together. Knight supposed that it wasn't too late to plan a daring escape - perhaps he could try and incapacity the guards, before making a break for it. But that wasn't his purpose, at this point, so he instead allowed them to walk him across the courtyard.\n\nThere was quite the crowd that had gathered. Many faceless, suited men jeered at Knight as he walked past, and he glanced impassively at them. They would get what was coming to them one day. As he stepped onto the gallows, he couldn't help but reminisce on how he got here. Those early days as a midshipman in the navy, to the infiltration of the Fascisti. His time as head of MI5. The uprising. Failure. Perhaps one day, someone would succeed where he had failed.\n\nAs the noose tightened around his neck, Maxwell Knight stared out into his crowd of executors. He breathed, and spoke his last words."

 chiefmouser.2.t: "Peter III's Great Journey"
 chiefmouser.2.d: "\"Peter!\" called out a secretary wandering the halls of 10 Downing Street after hours. \"Pe-ter! Where'd you go?\" At each turn and in each room, she turned on the lights, poked her head in and called out for the Chief Mouser. Her hope was that he would emerge from the shadows, a half-chewed rat in his mouth as an apology for his absence. The rest of the office had long since given up that hope. Ever since this civil war had erupted, 10 Downing Street was a chaotic blur of harried civil servants and an ever-growing military presence, partly coordinating the war alongside Nall-Cain's staff. Somewhere in that chaos, Peter III had quietly slipped away.\n\nHer search having exhausted all corners of the office she was permitted to travel, the secretary then expanded to the streets surrounding Downing. When the day was done, she travelled London with a tin of liver in hand, calling for the absent Chief Mouser. Every stray was a potential contact, every chewed pigeon in an alleyway a clue. She pursued her work with tireless dedication, searching for the one thing that made this blasted job worthwhile.\n\nOn the tenth day of her extended search, she went to Soho Square Gardens. It was night, and electric lights bathed the park in warm amber. In this period of national emergency all was still, save the faint whirr of jeep engines and jackboots on concrete. There, between the legs of Charles II's marble statue, Peter III was curled up. Her eyes shone with delight. Liver in hand, she slowly approached the cat. He rose his head, but did not move. She set the liver down on the base of the statue, and Peter III poked, prodded and finally ate the gift. He craned his neck up and looked at the secretary, whose hand was extended towards him.\n\nShe liked to think that she understood what he was thinking. The soft purr, the nuzzling of her open hand, was a final thank you. Then he turned and leaped off the statue, scurrying into the bushes. It was as close to a resignation as a cat could give."
 chiefmouser.2.a: "\"Peter III spent his final days roaming England, whose adventures are beyond our scope.\""
 chiefmouser.3.t: "고양이 외교"
 chiefmouser.3.d: "Ronald Nall-Cain's meeting with the German ambassador was meant to confirm, with full certainty, his government's triumph over the rebels. The afternoon proceeded as he expected: they each gave a speech affirming their commitment to good governance in Britain and cooperation with the Einheitspakt, then they had afternoon tea in front of cameras. Diplomatic gifts were exchanged. Polite conversation was held.\n\n\"We have one more gift for you,\" said the German ambassador, and their attention was turned to a cloth-draped box brought forth by one of the ambassador's assistants. Lacking a magician's flourish, the ambassador merely pulled the cloth out of the way and revealed a pet carrier. Emerging into the light was a little creature, white-coated and blue-eyed, with wide ears and small, straight whiskers.\n\n\"She is a German Rex,\" recited the ambassador with little intonation as his gift blinked. Nall-Cain looked at the ambassador, then at his staff who lay beyond the crowd, then at the cat. \"A product of Aryan breeding born only a few days ago, we give this gift to the English people as a symbol of new life out of the struggles of war.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"what a lovely gift, Mr. Ambassador.\" He scooped the kitten up into his arms, who seemed too bewildered to scratch her way out. \"You know, we've been looking for a new Chief Mouser.\" He gave the kitten a little scratch on the head. Some of the civil servants in the crowd deflated; the Reich's generosity precluded their own pets from being selected. The German ambassador had a vague idea of what a Chief Mouser was and did not care to know more.\n\nThe cat looked up at him with those big eyes, and Nall-Cain was struck with a question: what to name her? An answer soon followed, one that would hopefully call to mind a simpler, stronger time. A name that would tell everyone that everything was just like it was before."
 chiefmouser.3.a: "Say hello to little Peta, Britain."
 chiefmouser.4.t: "Blue Sky Thinking"
 chiefmouser.4.d: "Peta paced the length of Andrew Fountaine's office as he signed off on tonight's final work. Most reports requiring his attention involved the growing rivalry between Hamm and Bean. Every day, one or the other received a new source of support, and Fountaine had trouble trying to keep up with who was the favourite in his office.\n\nHe felt claws on his legs and let out a slight yelp of panic. Peta had crawled up his leg, thinking the best spot for a nap was the Prime Minister's lap. \"Bloody cat,\" he muttered. His hands reached out to grab the Chief Mouser but stopped mid-flight. An idea formed in the Prime Minister's head: silly, yes, but alone in his office, none would know and think less of him for indulging it.\n\nWith Peta perched on his lap, Fountaine pulled out some old photographs from files on his desk. He found a less than flattering one of Hamm in his old black shirt, arm raised and shouting at some past rally. Bean's was far less dynamic, a mere front-facing portrait in which he wore a somewhat gormless smile. Clearing some space at the end of his desk, he sat these two photographs at equal distance from each other, their faces towards Fountaine and his newest advisor.\n\n\"Come on, girl,\" said Fountaine. \"Which one do you like the most?\"\n\nPeta's eyes flicked between the two portraits. Fountaine watched the trajectory of her head with curiosity and trepidation. He could not see her face directly, but in his mind's eye he conjured a facial expression which read as pensive thought in a cat and projected it onto Peta as her head swivelled between the two photos.\n\nThen she turned around, leapt off the desk and wandered to the door. Fountaine could not help but chuckle; he got up and opened the door, letting out the Chief Mouser to return to her duty."
 chiefmouser.4.a: "He dared not recount this tale to anyone, lest they think he was mad or desperate."
 chiefmouser.5.t: "A Peculiar Pest"
 chiefmouser.5.d: "Wallop would never admit it openly, but his first thoughts upon seeing the newest Chief Mouser skulking was whether they would kick up too much of a fuss if he stuffed the mangy rat-catcher in a sack and threw her into the Thames. Perhaps that sounded harsh, but Wallop had never particularly liked urban cats. Separated from a natural wilderness suitable for its development, raised among humans who could not teach these cats what its true mothers might, these little creatures would wreak havoc on natural wildlife. Many smaller animals risked endangerment or extinction because the urbanites of Britain insist on keeping these pests as pets.\n\nWallop preferred the stalwart companionship of dogs to the arbitrary proclivities of a cat, but he admitted that was a hard sell for 10 Downing Street. The staff who he inherited were used to a feline presence, and the staff he brought with them had come to expect it. They had all heard stories about the light Peter III brought into their lives and demanded that Peta bring them the same. Considering the secretaries he caught cooing over the creature in lieu of proper work, Peta had succeeded.\n\nLate one night, when the demands of his new role forced Wallop to stay at 10 Downing Street rather than his beloved Chequers, he kept his head down and his lights dimmed, writing as if under candlelight to replicate a more comfortable experience. His door was left slightly ajar, as he was expecting Bedford to join him later that night, but the door creaked open with nobody there. Wallop looked up, and like an unwelcome phantasm up leaped from behind the desk the Chief Mouser.\n\nPeta meowed, stretched her limbs and lay down on Wallop's paperwork. His mental defences broke under this overwhelming assault. With a liver-spotted hand, he reached out and scratched between Peta's ears. The cat closed its eyes, purred and, having found this act of fealty acceptable, leapt off the desk and back into the light of the hallway."
 chiefmouser.5.a: "Peta would be spared the sack and the river this day."
 chiefmouser.6.t: "Catfights"
 chiefmouser.6.d: "Butler saw Wilson enter the room with a frown; that was expected, a sign of some conflict old or new that he would have to mediate. Maudling frowned—no, Butler blinked, and then he saw confusion on his face. \"Mr. Wilson,\" Maudling asked, \"just what the hell have you got on your face?\"\n\n\"This?\" Wilson ran a finger over the fresh scratch on his chin. \"Nothing to bother yourself with, Mr. Maudling. Now,\" opening his briefcase on the table, \"regarding the latest proposal from—\"\n\n\"You haven't been in a fight, have you?\" Butler meant it honestly, but Wilson's deepened frown suggested a lack of appreciation for that concern.\n\n\"Very well, if you must know. It's that mangy little cat of yours, Peta.\"\n\n\"Peta scratched you?\" Butler's jaw slackened in slight horror; Maudling snorted, covering his mouth to suppress his giggle. \"But we know her to be a sweetheart! Besides, what were you doing with Peta in the first place?\"\n\nWilson sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. \"Mary wanted to see the new Chief Mouser, and she insisted on bringing Nemo along. God knows why, but in a few minutes the two were in a bloody great row.\" He tried to ignore the tittering that escaped Maudling's grip. \"Mary was screaming, the cats were screaming. I tried to pull Peta off Nemo, and the little bugger clipped me on the face. I'm telling you, that monster was out of control, Nemo might have sepsis, and would you stop bloody laughing, Mr. Maudling?\"\n\nMaudling cackled like a broken engine, doubled over into the table. Wilson grit his teeth, eyes narrowed, brow furrowed. Butler, with the same mental picture of a flustered Wilson trying to pull away squabbling cats, forced himself to wipe the smirk from his face."
 chiefmouser.6.a: "\"Okay, Reggie, that's enough. We have business to discuss.\""
 joyce.1.t: "독일이 부른다"
 joyce.1.d: "Clemens Arneth waited outside London Airport, and saw his passenger emerge from the concourse; a sneering, scarred bespectacled man flanked by a makeshift honour guard. William Joyce, the new Lord Protector of Great Britain, barely paid attention to Arneth as his new bodyguard opened the passenger door of a New Class sedan. He threw himself in as Arneth stepped into the driver's seat.\n\n\"It's an honour to meet you, Lord Protector,\" he said. \"My name's Clemens, and-\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Clemence,\" Joyce snapped, \"but just drive.\"\n\nArneth did as he was told. Maybe he would warm up later; he was stuck with him. They drove north along the M23, little flags bearing the new national symbol fluttering in the breeze, flanked by military jeeps Arneth had driven in Moskowien. The car shook along the battle-torn road; Joyce scoffed at the sights outside.\n\nThey entered the city at noon, where Arneth saw little plumes of smoke in the distance. The streets were clear save for transport trucks and military vehicles; soldiers outnumbered civilians two to one, and German soldiers outnumbered British ones six to one. Gunshots echoed off the concrete and cobblestone; Joyce flinched and gasped. \"Nothing to worry about, sir,\" Arneth said, turning off the A3. \"Just some clean-up.\" They passed by freshly-cleaned walls with horizontal lines of holes, homes with caved-in roofs.\n\nAs they drove closer to the city they encountered an endless number of armed checkpoints. Some saw the license plate and waved it through; others closer to the Thames triple-checked Arneth's papers. Joyce held his tongue at this delay. They crossed over the river and along the Millbank, passing by iron-frame carcasses towards Westminster. \"Here we are, sir,\" said Arneth, who received nothing more than a scoff. He opened the door and watched Joyce leave with only a mumbled thanks, leading him inside towards his new office."

Andrew had insisted on the event, an opportunity to welcome Old Guard MP's back to the right side and John fully understood the reasoning. The night had been valuable for him too, giving him an opportunity to leverage favors with a few, and pressure some others. But that didn't mean he'd ever forget how fickle their loyalties were. \n\n\"Spineless rats, aren't they? The entire worthless lot of them.\" \n\nBean snorted. Hamm had a way with words.
