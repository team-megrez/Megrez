 illyria.3.t: "Matica ilirska"
 illyria.3.d: "'Matica ilirska' ('Parent body of the Illyrians') is the oldest educational organisation in Illyria, which started its activity as a book publishing company in 1842. The main aim of 'Matica' is the promotion of the Illyrian culture and language and also support to the mutual understanding between the nations of Illyria. With help of the 'Matica ilirska' the leaders of Illyria try to form a well-educated and an united Illyrian nation. Now one of the most important missions of the organisation is the codification of the Illyrian language standard. Though it has been a hard work, but it seems that the most famous Illyrian writers and linguists have finally negotiated, which rules of the language our young generation will learn at schools. The creation of the united Illyrian nation is closer now!"

 illyria.4.d: "일리리아 삼중 왕국에서는 하나의 언어, 남슬라브어를 사용하지만 크로아티아 방언과 세르비아 방언, 보스니아 방언은 약간 차이가 있습니다. 게다가 세르비아인은 키릴 문자를 사용하지만 보스니아인과 크로아티아인은 라틴 문자를 사용합니다. '마티차 일리르스카'에서 언어의 통합 표준을 만들었는데, 아직 이를 어떻게 불러야 할지 모릅니다. 크로아티아인이 전체의 60%를 차지하므로 이 언어를 '크로아티아어'라고 하고 라틴 문자를 쓸 수도 있습니다. 다른 방안은 일리리아의 30%를 차지하는 세르비아인을 위해 '세르보-크로아티아어'라고 이름은 붙이고 라틴 문자와 키릴 문자를 공용하는 것입니다. 아니면 국민의 단결을 장려하기 위해 '일리리아어'라고 이름 붙이고 라틴 문자를 사용할 수도 있습니다."

 CRO_slavko_kvaternik_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gAugust 25th, 1878, in Moravice, Croatia-Slavonia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gKvaternik graduated from Vienna’s Kriegsschule before the Weltkrieg, and from October 1914 to February 1916, he was adjutant to none-other than Svetozar Borojević, one of the most respected and competent commanders of the war. He would spend most of the war as a staff officer on the Italian front and, in 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and became chief of staff of the 55th Infantry Division, part of the Army of the Isonzo. After the Austro-Hungarian Army’s success against the Italians in 1919, Kvaternik was promoted once more and would end the war as a colonel. After the war, he remained in the army, retaining a high position among the staff of the semi-independent Croatian-Slavonian Home Guard behind illustrious Croatian war heroes such as Borojević and Stjepan Sarkotić. He quickly secured an important position as the Croatian-Slavonian Home Guard was reformed as the Illyrian Home Guard, making him a logical choice to succeed the ageing heroes, as Borojević passed away in 1923, and Sarkotić rose up to esteemed positions in the Austro-Hungarian Army before his retirement and term as Ban (governor) of Illyria. With the war heroes having passed their torch over to the younger generation, Kvaternik has found himself to be one of the most important Croatian commanders in the Austro-Hungarian Army, though he is largely untested as a field commander and his disdain for ethnic Serbs has caused significant friction in the Home Guard."
 CRO_mihajlo_lukic_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gSeptember 24th, 1886, in Virje, Croatia-Slavonia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gHailing from a family of Serbian origin, Lukić attended a cadet school in Karlovac before studying in Vienna’s Kriegsschule. He completed his staff officer courses shortly before the Weltkrieg began and would serve for the entirety of the war. After the war, he quickly rose up the ranks within the Austro-Hungarian general staff and was made colonel in 1931, then general in 1935. With his wartime experience and later work with Austrian alpine troops, he is one of the likely candidates to lead mountain units should larger ones be organised in the future."
 CRO_fedor_dragojlov_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gAugust 21st, 1881, in Pančevo, Hungary, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gSon of a captain, Dragojlov comes from an Eastern Orthodox military family, graduating from the Military Technical Academy and the Kriegsschule in Vienna before the outbreak of war. He served in the Austro-Hungarian General Staff throughout the war, ending the war with the rank of colonel. Along with Kvaternik, Dragojlov was seen, after the war, as one of the potential successors to the Croat war heroes as they retired or passed away. For most of the interwar, he was assigned to the War Ministry in Vienna as part of the Operations Department. As he was made general in 1930, he began overhauling the training of Illyrian Home Guard units, especially with regards to mountain warfare."
 CRO_eduard_bunic_de_bona_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gMarch 14th, 1894, in Ogulin, Croatia-Slavonia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gScion of the oldest of Dubrovnik’s noble families and one of the oldest in Europe, Bunić chose a military career early in his life. He had barely been commissioned as a junior officer when the Weltkrieg broke out, and he would serve through the entire war in various cavalry regiments. By the end of the war, he was a captain, and he stayed in the Home Guard afterwards. In 1924, he attended the Kriegsschule in Vienna to train as a staff officer before being assigned to the Ministry of Defence in Zagreb, slowly rising to the rank of colonel by 1936. While he has no frontline experience at a level higher than company-level, he is one of the few Croat officers with experience with cavalry, even if that arm of the Home Guard has seen limited love since the war."
 CRO_matija_canic_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §g1901, in Gospić, Croatia-Slavonia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gLittle is known about Čanić’s early life. What is known is that he served in the Croatian-Slavonian Home Guard during the latter part of the Weltkrieg. By the end of it, he was captain of a cavalry squadron of the 10th Home Guard Hussar Regiment. After the war, he remained in the Home Guard as it was reorganised into the military force of the reorganised Kingdom of Illyria. He was eventually set to Vienna to take staff officer courses at the Kriegsschule, graduating in 1926. He then served in the Illyrian Ministry of Defence, where he rose to the rank of colonel. It is no secret that he is a very young commander with limited experience, and what little he has was commanding nothing larger than a squadron."
 CRO_vladimir_laxa_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gJanuary 21st, 1870, in Sisak, Croatia-Slavonia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gCommissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1890, Laxa was already a senior officer when the Weltkrieg broke out. In 1917, as colonel of the general staff and commander of the 18th Infantry Brigade, he distinguished himself during the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo: For \"heroism, enormous bravery, and tenaciously successful defence of positions\", he was awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresia, the Austro-Hungarian Army’s top award. He was, without a doubt, one of the most distinguished Croat senior officers of the war, and rapidly rose through the ranks after its conclusion. He is largely seen as de facto \"second-in-command\" of the Illyrian Home Guard behind Kvaternik, with General Dragojlov his nearest equivalent. However, his relationship with the former remains tense, and could become strained over disagreements in leadership style."

 CRO_country_intro_content: "The Triune Kingdom of Illyria, which consists of the former Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Kingdom of Dalmatia and Condominium of Bosnia was proclaimed after the Crisis in Austria-Hungary and German Intervention in 1926. The creation of Illyria was proposed by the loyal to Vienna Croatian aristocrats and officers of the Austro-Hungarian Army, who promised to be loyal to the Kaiser Karl and Austria, but claimed more autonomy and the end of the Hungarian rule on the lands of the South Slavs. Though the Triune Kingdom should have become a home for the Catholic Croats, Orthodox Serbs and Muslim Bosniaks, in fact there are a lot of controversies between these nations. The Serbs want to reunite with their Serbian Motherland, the Bosniaks want to get more independence, and the Croats, who have a relative majority in the country, want to strengthen their position in the country and reorganise it into the Great Croatia. But now the Austrians help us to secure the order of our Balkan Kingdom."
