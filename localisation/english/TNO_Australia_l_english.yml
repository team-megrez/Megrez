 POLITICS_ARTHUR_CALWELL_DESC: "Support for the White Australia policy has slowly diminished over the last twenty years. The network of racist legislation first passed to safeguard Australia as an outpost of the British race in Oceania has been, and is slowly being, unwound by a new generation of cautious reformists.\n\nPolitical lepers, the lot of them!\n\nArthur Augustus Calwell is the most dogged, full-throated defender of the White Australia policy in the Federal Parliament. Calwell contends that standing as sovereign of his own nation, the African, the Asian, and the mulatto is equal to the white man, but upon his first step in Australia, he becomes a pollutant. No nation, however strong, can survive the unsegregated cohabitation of the races. It is with this line of thinking that Calwell argues he is not a racist, but merely proud of his color, as any man ought to be. His critics deride him for this. Calwell reckons they're all ratbags.\n\nIndeed, what Calwell reckons has always come first. He argues that the media misrepresents him: that they never focus on the working-class man orating from the back of pickup trucks in isolated townships on the need for rural hospitals; on the self-educated unionist conversant in Mandarin who argues against involvement in foreign wars; or the community-minded Socialist who champions welfare and good wages.\n\nBut all of that ends at the color line. In the hazy bar of Parliament House, holding a shot glass level to his eyes, the Prime Minister grins and rasps to his comrades, \"Two Wongs do not make a White.\""

In these turbulent times, the voters of Australia have emphasised the need for dependability and trust in their Premier. It is then little surprise that Clyde Cameron has seized the lead and triumphed in the elections.\n\nAn infamous pragmatist within the Labor Party, Cameron has managed to use his allies within the grinding gears of the Party Machine to become the ALP's choice for the ballot. While he has triumphed within, the road to keep Adelaide Avenue was always going to be one fraught with dangers and potholes. While his opponents may spin the re-election of a party that was embroiled in a scandal a few months ago - as a negative, Cameron's use of rhetoric and capitalisation of the uncertainty of the so-called 'Cold War' has erupted in a surge of votes in his favour.

John Gorton, a member of the Liberal Party, has taken the decisive lead he needs to become the next Prime Minister of Australia.\n\nA relative newcomer to the political scene, his ideology is like few others in the nation. Combining a policy of social progress and rights for the individual with his fervent support for the nation's economy to become more self-reliant and promotion of Australian businesses, the news must have been bad news for the economic masterminds in the United States seeking to deepen ties with the nation. However if this has been a minor bump for the OFN, it has been a catastrophe for Tokyo.

With the Liberal Party being comprised of devotees of the creed to devolve Canberra's outreach and place more emphasis on the individual and states, Hasluck's victory doesn't simply signal a change for the country, but a change at the very foundation of Australian politics.\n\nWith this electoral upset, Australia has chosen firmly to look into their past to solve the problems of their present. In his victory speech, Hasluck referenced the 'lack of unity' within society, pledging to 'mend the divide' and to 'fix society' once and for all.

A crusader fighting against the plague of illiteracy and slack-jawed idiocy in the Sunburnt Nation. In other, missed futures - slipping through his fingers like minute grains of sand - perhaps Beazley wouldn't have had to become Prime Minister. Content with his position inside the House of Representatives, Beazley could have settled himself as a modern Cicero, tackling his opponents with acerbic wit and passion inside his shining city on the hill.\n\nBut these are not peaceful times. Australia finds itself on the verge of encirclement by Tokyo's unrelenting waves. An entire generation of young men lies rotting inside the Papuan jungle, with not even the Charon's consolation of victory cradle their spirits as they cross the Styx. Only the logistical nightmare of invasion and occupation of the Land Down Under saved Australia from being skewed upon the blood-encrusted bayonets of the Japanese Empire. With only a tenuous lifeline to America, many are starting to wonder. Will Australia survive to fight another day? Or will it - like Eastern Asia - succumb to the Sun's blinding glare? Or will the most heinous enemy come from within?\n\nFaced with such dire consequences as one's independence, it is no wonder why the young man is such a proponent of renewed ties to Washington's warm embrace. After all, with Britannia's Throne claimed by traitorous pretenders, is it little wonder why Australia should align with the Last Hope of Liberty?

Treading the narrow passageways of Parliament House, he overhears party adversaries deride his policies as a strain of creeping Socialism - \"Gortonism\", they call it. They say they're like a club of mushrooms: kept in the dark and fed on shit. Gorton just laughs and asks if he can join, and so his backbenchers call him \"Chief Spore\".\n\nBut past all his jokes, Gorton knows that he is isolated. He is an economic nationalist, social liberal, hard drinker, and chronic womanizer, and for these abnormalities, he is on one day labeled a threat, and on the next, an embarrassment. They don't know how little their jibes sting; Gorton has endured much worse. They don't know about the airplane crash, or the childhood spent loving a mother trapped in a sanatorium. They don't know the man who lost his face, only to walk in front of the cameras and smile anyway.\n\nGorton's mission, as he sees it, is to bring progress to a nation content with the security of political Luddism. Whether he will trust his cabinet with this mission is sure to be one of the defining dilemmas of his premiership. Or, perhaps, his last."
 POLITICS_CLYDE_CAMERON_DESC: "Clyde Cameron broods at the fork of old and new Labor, not knowing which way the wind will blow. He rakes his hair, scratches his neck, and considers the currents. He refers to his diaries, which he has kept every day since he joined the parliamentary caucus, with times, vote tallies, and snide remarks all recorded. Looking over the figures of Australian leftism - from the antediluvian party elders to the neophytes running student occupations - Cameron decides on the need for a new strategy and a change in leadership.\n\nOnce a Labor head-kicker, Clyde Cameron gradually developed into a calm, diligent, and vindictive political operator respected by parliamentarians on both sides of the aisle. Within Labor, he champions the need to accommodate a changing electorate and the erosion of old voting coalitions. But Cameron's image as a pragmatist hides the idealistic, stalwart Socialist underneath. No one will dissuade him from his dream: an Australia where the worker lives in happiness and security, tolerance has triumphed over bigotry, and war is never waged.\n\nTo forge such a future, there must first be the Socialists who will bring it about. Cameron knows that Parliament considers him spiteful and fastidious. He suspects that the ASIO and the CIA monitor him, as well. If he fails, despite his energies, then Cameron will educate the next generation of Australian Socialists to accomplish what he could not. Cameron has vitriol in surplus for his enemies, but he affords the struggle for a better world, and the strugglers most of all, nothing but admiration."
 POLITICS_PAUL_HASLUCK_DESC: "From poet to politician, to historian, and now Prime Minister, Paul Meernaa Caedwalla Hasluck has built his entire career on a fathomless energy for his dearest passions. Coming from a modest Fremantle home, Hasluck first broke into public policy by writing newspaper articles under the pseudonym 'Polygon.' Many Western Australians knew his advocacy for forward defense or international governance before they knew his real name. But when Hasluck arrived in the House of Representatives in 1949, many members found him difficult to know.\n\nHasluck's contemporaries have supplied many assessments: he is collegial but somewhat stuffy, prohibitively fastidious, formal, well-read, private, and good-humored, with a preference for governance rather than politics. He despises shouting and loud noises in general. He prizes clarity. Hasluck resents delegating, preferring the comfort in private ministrations and a sense of duty sated. He is demanding, sometimes aggressive to subordinates, and loves the Australian land dearly.\n\nThe red flatness of the Outback is now just a vagrant memory. Even in the tight halls of Parliament House, with its stubborn cigarette haze and crushing tight corridors, Hasluck occasionally feels the phantom touch of windswept sand tracking around his ankles. But his task is unchanged. The order that must be impressed - if necessary, by assimilation - is one of liberty and individualism, respect and duty, and resoluteness. Hasluck pretends at no higher purpose. His mission, he knows, is born of the common obligation at the heart of all humankind."
 POLITICS_AUTHDEM_JOH_DESC: "To say that this was unexpected would be understating things. Few expected Johannes 'Joh' Bjelke-Petersen to run for the Premiership. Burdened by such a narrow support base, his violently inflammatory rhetoric and a run as the Queensland Premier marred by scandal and accusation upon accusation, it was clear why most mainstream political figures shrugged him off. Making his takeover of the Liberal-Country Coalition and victory in the elections only more stunning.\n\nBut of course, Joh was never aiming for the 'mainstream' audience now, was he? What has propelled the polio survivor to victory was not his backing by large corporations and fat-cat donors - although Joh was never one to turn down a free boost in the campaign - or his skilful handling of the burgeoning television and mass-media news - although that certainly helped. No, it was something much more base and primal. Hatred. Hatred for the pompous elites. Joh is a Prime Minister for the common man - a group that has had little weight inside Parliament until now. What Australia needs is someone who can speak with, not down to, the Citizen. Not that relentless scrabble in the trade unions or the tax office, that demands more and more to line their own pockets. If they're under the delusion that they can act as one, then they'll find out just how wrong they are.\n\nWhile the old, dying guard and the chains of bureaucracy may attempt to stop Joh, they cannot stop the people. Australia, by any means necessary, will be rebuilt into a home for all true citizens. Even if he has to break every single rule and defy every single regulation in the book."
 POLITICS_DESPOT_JOH_DESC: "Australia is diseased. Putrescent to the palpitating, rotting core.

Yes, above. The Canberra Elites, with their imported cigars and decadent orgies of backroom scheming and chardonnay, laugh from their ivory towers. They cackle as their puppets play politics while they continue to put their diamond-encrusted boot on the hard-working taxpayer. What has this land become?\n\nNo more. No more cries Joh. Like the tatters of the Constitution that line Joh's feet, these twin snakes will be strangled with the full might of the Executive Branch. Critics whine about the 'brazen' disregard for democracy by destroying that Constitution, live on air. Good, says Joh. Good that the ultimate symbol of elitism and champagne-soaked 'intellectualism' reels in agony. Good that the mainstream media, with their pockets lined with blood money, detests him so. Good that nobody will be able to stop him now.\n\nEven now, a transformation is occurring in Australia. Those who refuse to cooperate with Joh's new order, will be crushed underneath his boot. Police, armed to the teeth with lethal firepower, storm the offices of unruly journalists. In candlelight, Country Party enforcers redraw the lines of districts into grotesque salients and blotches, making sure that Australian Democracy only has one master.

 POLITICS_EVATT_DESC: "Herbert Vere Evatt was once a lambent star. An intimidatingly intelligent lawyer, Evatt graduated from the University of Sydney with first-class honors in four fields, two university medals, and, later, a Legum Doctor. He became an industrial lawyer, then the youngest High Court Justice in Australian history, and then from Leader of the Labor Party to be Prime Minister. But Evatt's brilliant mind has rusted away.\n\nEvatt suffers from the dual blights of cerebral thrombosis and arteriosclerosis. His memories, once like delicate friezes etched into steel, have slowly receded into an ambient buzz. Many in the Labor Party would say that Evatt's fall began before his mind slipped away - when he first decided that he was smarter than everyone else. He made a million decisions without consultation, half of them successful, half of them not. In Parliament, Evatt could no longer impress a pace on his environment.\n\nOscillating between serenity and belligerence, but nightmarishly lucid, Evatt hews at the heart of a political quagmire. The factions and the Liberals crowd him. Parliament has turned against the White Australia policy, and Evatt has not turned with them. His mind lies to him as the clock counts down, suggesting facts he knows are false. Perhaps what good Evatt could have done has already been done. Perhaps all his judgments will succeed him sooner than he thought.\n\nPerhaps his time is at an end."
 POLITICS_JOHN_MCEWEN_DESC: "John \"Black Jack\" McEwen, the Prime Minister of Australia, is a grim man who grew up in a narrow room in the back of a chemist's shop. McEwen's mother died when he was two and his father died when he was seven. He left school at thirteen to provide for his grandmother and younger sister, and in 1918, he left his work to join the Australian Imperial Force in their fight against the Central Powers. He never saw combat, but his service made him eligible for a grant of farmland from the Australian government. From there, he tilled the land, made a productive farm, and joined the Victorian Farmers' Union to do, as he saw it, the same thing but on a bigger scale. Federal politics was the next step up.\n\nMcEwen climbed up the Country Party quickly; he became a minister, then deputy leader of the Country Party, then leader. Country activism came naturally. All he had to do was stand straighter than his company and stick to his guns. In a party of free-traders, McEwen became known as an advocate of protectionist economics and agricultural-industrial development, vaulting into rage-filled outbursts when his steady fund of patience wore out. Now, having endured the full tenure of a deposed prime minister, McEwen weathers the storm at the top of the mountain, stone-faced and obstinate, trying to enforce a sense of calm.\n\nBut the stress is adding up. All the arguments, all the travel, all the labor, all the years filing him down, are working him from top to bottom. The skin on his feet, hands, and chest has grown scaly and dry. Whenever he walks, his skin cracks and his feet bleed. He'll change bandages during the day and get on with his work. It's what the country needs. Hard yakka makes a hard man, and John McEwen reckons it's only right that Australia's hardest man does Australia's hardest yakka.

Whitlam has spent the better part of the sixties raging against the Labor Party's old-style social conservatives to advocate a new program of radical reform. He kept dissenting even when it broke party rules and the higher-ups threatened expulsion. He kept going, he says, because people either crash through or crash. He couldn't go any other way because his conscience wouldn't allow it. He couldn't accept the current state of things because all of it is so embarrassing, because all of it is so wrong. So, with a new generation of middle-class reformers behind him, Whitlam crashed through.\n\nGough Whitlam, the Prime Minister of Australia, is a compassionate, moral man who bludgeons people with his intellect. He is inflexible and withdrawn, belittling as often as he consults. Few in the Federal Parliament can challenge him in debate or knowledge of the issues he selects for remediation. His opponents call him arrogant. Whitlam agrees and insists that they are ignorant. Enraged, his opponents ask him how he would face God at the end of his life. Whitlam says they can all be sure he'll treat Him as an equal.\n\nWhitlam will turn the House floor into an anvil upon which he will hammer progressive legislation into being and reactionary MPs into oblivion. No one should have to suffer the products of ignorance. Within the next three years, so Whitlam swears, Australians will enjoy universal healthcare, free university, legalized abortion, recognition of Aboriginal land rights, freedom from conscription, and sweeping constitutional reform to enshrine new fundamental rights. All of that, Whitlam swears, and so much more, when he crashes through again.\n\n§P\"They are lofty, I am eminent.\"§!"
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_MCMAHON_DESC: "The telephone sitting on the Prime Minister of Australia's desk is beige and glossy and new. Before William McMahon, calls came into the Prime Minister's office through a row of telephonists tucked between hardwood partitions in the northeastern corridor of Parliament House. Now, every call comes through McMahon. Every scheme comes through McMahon. Every friendly message from a media magnate comes through McMahon, and every policy order comes from McMahon. He can hardly think to part with it all, Tiberius With a Telephone and his network for deregulation.\n\nWilliam McMahon is the Liberal Party's specialist on economic matters. His overscrupulous memoranda have been read aloud in Parliament House many times and debated in party rooms many times more. Liberal Members of Parliament know well, though, to scrutinize every word that comes out of McMahon's mouth. He is a brilliant administrator and a knowledgeable economist, undoubtedly, but he dispenses half-truths, exaggerations, and lies more frequently than anything else. He is stiff and uncharismatic, nervous, and intense; a tireless advocate for financial deregulation, budget-balancing, and progressive innovation wherever the budget permits. His challenge is getting the Parliament to trust him when things come to a vote.\n\nNow, William McMahon sits at his desk, rapping his fingers on the handpiece of his telephone. He knows that the person who picks up won't trust him. He knows that wrangling the Senate and the House and the public will be as hard as a fresh-cut diamond. That's fine. He's not above putting in a few extra hours."
 POLITICS_MALCOLM_FRASER_DESC: "Born to Victorian sheep farmers, Malcolm Fraser originally intended to continue the family business, going to school for economics and philosophy. However, a fateful meeting of the Young Liberals in Hamilton in the early 50s changed Fraser's career, and he soon found himself enraptured by Australian politics.\n\nHis time in the party has been rough, losing his first election, only to find success a year later. Slowly Fraser built up his standing in the party, cycling through a series of party positions and cabinet ministers over the years. Finally, having battled and won against Billy Snedden in a party leadership spill, he now finds himself both the leader of his party and all of Australia.\n\nPolitically, Fraser is a supporter of multiculturalism, standing with the oppressed people of the Sphere that might see Australia as a refuge from tyranny, and a continuation of the nation's welfare state, even if heavy on the purse. All progress should come at a measured pace, and Fraser is not about to stop the steady pace that got him where he is today. More than anything though, he is a staunch hawk in foreign policy and is willing to do anything to see fascism repelled both at home and abroad."

 POLITICS_JIM_CAIRNS_DESC: "Much has changed in Australia, to have James Ford Cairns serve as Prime Minister of that island nation at the hour in which he finds himself. Cairns shall seize the moment and do what he can to bring about his concept of a better nation.\n\nCairns, a socialist from very early on, was born to a family whose father went to war and did not return. He served as a policeman from 1933 to 1944, then joined the Labour Party, where he continued on his career, promoting his concept of socialism and doing what parliamentarians did—until it all changed and he found himself Prime Minister.\n\nThe new Prime Minister is a socialist adherent of the so-called New Left. By profession an economist and deeply attached to theory, he is not so far into theory that he loses track of reality; he is rightly commended for his administrative skills. He is not one to change his behaviour for anyone; everyone gets the \"full Jim\", who is typically polite but forthright about his wishes.\n\nThough he is not violent, he is committed to his views; this combined with his public sympathy for the more psychological and spiritual elements of Australian counterculture may lead to grating against some Australian institutions. But Cairns is certain that he will be able to do what he can regardless; time shall tell the truth of his views."
 POLITICS_BILLY_SNEDDEN_DESC: "Born in Perth to an illiterate mother and a father who fled from Scotland to escape the law. Few ever thought Billy Snedden would amount to much, but he was no quitter. At the age of 8 he worked in construction with his brothers, helping out any way he could. In 1942 at only 15 he landed a job as a junior law clerk, paving the way for his entry into politics.\n\nOfficially entering the political arena in 1954 as a Liberal member for the House of Representatives, he served in the Cabinet of Robert Menzies until their eventual defeat in 1961. As a member of the opposition he was made Shadow Minister for Immigration. There he made a name for himself as an extremely effective legislator, and a hawk internationally.\n\nIn 1971 he challenged the leadership of the Liberal Party. Seen as a dark horse candidate by most MP's, Unexpectedly not only did Snedden defeat his main competition in Malcom Fraser, he utterly bulldozed him, becoming leader of the Liberal Party. Campaigning against Labor, Snedden promised to strengthen Australian democracy.\n\nWinning the election after a brutal campaign, the first thing on the Prime Minister's agenda is to reform the culture of Parliament. His detractors doubt his time in the top job will amount to much, but Billy Snedden is no quitter."
