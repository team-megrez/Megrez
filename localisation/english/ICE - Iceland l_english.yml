 ice.19.d: "In a daring raid against the British fishing trawler Carlisle, the crew of the Ægir found themselves under attack from a new British squadron that was freshly deployed to the region. The commander of the RNS Dunedin ordered his ship to ram the Ægir to protect their fishing vessel. After two ram attempts, the Ægir was barely left upright hanging on by a single screw. In an act of desperation, the commander of the Ægir gave the order to man the guns, in spite of the overwhelming firepower advantage that the Dunedin had at her disposal. Serviceman Guðmundur Kjærnested manned the 6 pounder to deter the Dunedin from finishing the fleeing patrol vessel off. News of the crew's heroism has swept across the nation and people are calling for the knighting of Guðmundur Kjærnested."

 ice.23.d: "Today marks the departure of the newly formed Northwest Atlantic Squadron for the Icelandic waters. The fleet is composed of the destroyers HMCS Sterling and Tactician led by the light cruiser HMCS Dauntless. Command will be issued from the HMCS Cumberland which will serve as the flagship. Together, our proud men set sail to protect our trade from those godless syndicalists in the Home Isles."
 ice.23.a: "Good Luck and Godspeed!"
 ice.24.t: "Canadian fleet arrives"
 ice.24.d: "Our harbour was busy today as the Canadian ships we requested have just arrived. The British destroyer RNS Seawolf had been prowling after a few of our fishing trawlers waiting for an opportune moment to disrupt our haul for the day but the arrival of the Northwest Atlantic Squadron had the destroyer fleeing with its tail between its legs. The Canadian sailors were given a cheerful greeting by our fishermen on the docks as they pulled into the harbour."
 ice.24.a: "Welcome Canadians!"
 ice.25.t: "Canadian armed forces arrive"
 ice.25.d: "On a bit of a quieter note, forces from Canada have landed in Akureyri last night. They opted to take a more indirect route through the Arctic waters to avoid catching the notice of any British vessels. In the event that we are attacked, we will be better prepared to hold back the enemy."
 ice.25.a: "Reassuring"
 ice.26.t: "No aid from Canada"
 ice.26.d: "Disappointing news came today as our envoy to Canada has reported back that the Canadians are unwilling to devote any resources to help protect us and the cod trade between our two countries. We can not expect any aid from Canada from the Republican navy."
 ice.26.a: "We stand alone"
 ice.27.t: "More lost fishing trawlers"
 ice.27.d: "As the week continues since the Canadians neglected to send support to us, we have had massive problems with the Republican navy. Their bolstered forces are able to terrorise our vessels and restrict nearly all fishing off of our southern coast. We have contacted Canada to inform them of the cancellation of our trade agreement due to our inability to protect our fishermen."
 ice.27.a: "We must admit defeat..."
 ice.28.t: "Fishing deal with Iceland is ended"
 ice.28.d: "Iceland's fishermen are ruthlessly attacked without our aid which has severely diminished the amount of fish they can haul as fewer fishermen are willing to go out on the seas. To this end, the merchants from Iceland have informed us that the trade deal between our countries is at an end."
 ice.28.a: "Unfortunate"
 ice.29.t: "Send an ultimatum to Iceland?"
 ice.29.d: "With the situation in Iceland firmly under our control, we now face a crossroads. We could send some representatives to Iceland to 'suggest' that they form a new syndicalist government under our guidance. Or we could leave them alone on their island without any other major allies."
 ice.29.a: "Send some representatives"
 ice.29.b: "Let them remain isolated"
 ice.291.t: "Ultimatum from Britain"
 ice.291.d: "With the Canadian forces unwilling to engage further, Iceland has fallen further and further into the British sphere. Now, Britain has sent representatives 'strongly suggesting' we adopt a syndicalist government and join the Third Internationale. What is not said, of course, is the implied threat of using force to enforce it - they will not accept a refusal. Without any allies left, we have little choice but to comply."
 ice.291.a: "We must bow"
 ice.30.t: "Alone in the Atlantic"
 ice.30.d: "As the cod war draws to a close, the Union of Britain stands dominant over us. However, they have contented themselves with merely leaving us adrift, alone, and allyless in the Atlantic. Now we must figure out what to do with our mourning country."
 ice.30.a: "Looking to the East"
 ice.31.t: "Canadian Fleet Arrives"
 ice.31.d: "The royalists have recently arrived in Iceland to help them claim our waters as their own!. The presence of their squadron has our republican navy on the back foot. We need a new strategy for our probes into the Atlantic."
 ice.31.a: "Get Aggressive"
 ice.31.b: "Stick Together"
 ice.32.t: "Aggressive strikes from the British"
 ice.32.d: "While the Canadian squadron has been effective in stopping some attacks against our trawlers, frequently our fishermen have found themselves under attack before they can radio for help in time. With a force of planes flying recon overhead, we can get the edge we need against the Republican navy."
 ice.32.a: "Request planes for aerial recon"
 ice.33.t: "All quiet in the North Atlantic"
 ice.33.d: "For now, the skirmishes in the Atlantic have come to a close. The Canadians and British have been eyeing each other up as the fleets shadow each other's movements. Neither side has been willing to force an engagement as the Canadians do not want to be seen as the aggressors while the British are unwilling to make a move against the overwhelming firepower of the modern heavy cruiser that leads the Canadian squadron."
 ice.33.a: "Peace at last!"
 ice.34.t: "Iceland requests scout planes"
 ice.34.d: "The government of Iceland has requested a lease of scout planes to help our squadron better protect their merchant's vessels."
 ice.34.a: "Send them the planes"
 ice.34.b: "We can't spare anything"
 ice.35.t: "Canada sends scout planes"
 ice.35.d: "The government in Canada has authorised the shipment of a wing of scout planes to help us defend our merchants."
 ice.35.a: "Thanks, Canada!"
 ice.36.t: "Canada does not send any scout planes"
 ice.36.d: "The Canadian government has told us that their planes are needed more elsewhere in the world."
 ice.36.a: "Unfortunate"
 ice.37.t: "A daring plan for the Atlantic"
 ice.37.d: "Admiral Norman Holbrook has come to us with a plan to break the Canadians stationed in Iceland. Recently returned from a hunting trip, Holbrook had inspiration come to him. Eventually, everyone falls into a routine pattern. He believes if we track the Canadians long enough they will eventually reveal a pattern of when they retire to harbour. Once we learn the timing, we can send a submarine in to blow their armoured cruiser before they even know what is happening, giving us the edge in the Atlantic!"
 ice.37.a: "Authorise the raid"
 ice.38.t: "The raid on the Cumberland"
 ice.38.d: "Tonight marked the appointed night of the raid. Our brave submarine crew operating underneath Holbrook took to the sea and carefully made their way to the harbour where the Canadian fleet was docked for the night. Due to the lax nature of the recent conflict in the Atlantic, there seemed to be no real attempt to post adequate sentries to stand guard against something like this. As Holbrook surfaced he fired two salvoes of torpedoes into the HMCS Cumberland. The first salvo was ineffective, bouncing off the hull, but the second salvo ripped a massive hole into the starboard hull immediately causing it to list over and begin to flood. Following this display of fireworks, Holbrook and his crew submerged and began their escape back to the safety of British waters."
 ice.38.a: "In and out clean"
 ice.39.t: "Claxons in the night"
 ice.39.d: "Chaos rang out in the harbour last night. The peace over the last month has led to our guard being more relaxed than it should have been. For tonight saw the loss of our heavy cruiser the HMCS Cumberland. Aboard, we lost some 300 sailors as the ship sunk fairly quickly. We suspect some of the ammunition was improperly stored below the deck or a that a boiler had a mechanical failure overnight. No matter the reason, this loss is felt deeply by everyone in Iceland and Canada."
 ice.39.a: "Chaos in the Harbour"
 ice.40.t: "Sombre news from Iceland"
 ice.40.d: "We have received grave news from Iceland today. Overnight, the heavy cruiser, HMCS Cumberland experienced a sudden explosion causing the ship to sink rapidly. The cause of the explosion is not known at this time but the incoming reports list at least 300 sailors lost in this tragic incident."
 ice.40.a: "A day of mourning"
 ice.41.t: "The fate of the Cumberland"
 ice.41.d: "Following the tragedy of the Cumberland, we have dispatched divers to search the wreckage for any more information that we missed in the chaos of the night. By the afternoon, our divers found the smoking gun. Almost literally. They found an intact syndicalist torpedo of British design laying on the bottom of the port. This tragedy was not a mechanical failure but a deliberate assault from the Union of Britain against us! We will not stand for this!"
 ice.41.a: "Demand an apology!"
 ice.42.t: "Cumberland submarine raid discovered"
 ice.42.d: "This morning we received a telegram from the government of Iceland demanding reparations for the sinking of the HMCS Cumberland. They claim to have indisputable evidence against us that prove we were the ones responsible for the loss of their ship. Our submarine crew claim they were in and out without being detected. How should we respond to this outrageous accusation?"
 ice.42.a: "Deny our role"
 ice.42.b: "Boast about our role in the sinking"
 ice.43.t: "The British response to the Cumberland Telegram"
 ice.43.d: "The British are denying their role in the sinking of the HCMS Cumberland. However, the torpedo we found is definite proof of their dastardly deed. The international community must know of the heinous nature of those in the Union of Britain to attack a ship full of boys in the dead of night."
 ice.43.a: "They will be forced to admit the truth"
 ice.44.t: "The British response to the Cumberland Telegram"
 ice.44.d: "The British have responded to our telegram with boasts. They boast proudly about their daring crewmen who were willing to sail into the jaws of our harbour to inflict damage upon us. They claim that they were only protecting their fishermen with a forward defence. The Canadians must know of the cruelty of their British brothers."
 ice.44.a: "Those devils!"
 ice.45.t: "British Torpedoes found near the corpse of the Cumberland"
 ice.45.d: "News has come from Iceland in regards to the cause of the sinking of the HMCS Cumberland. Divers found an intact British torpedo that failed to detonate when it was launched against the hull of the Cumberland. The explosion was not an internal mechanical failure after all but an insidious attempt by the British to cowardly attack us during the night. Our people clamour for revenge over the loss of our young men aboard the Cumberland who never made it to shore."
 ice.45.a: "The people shall be heard!"
 ice.46.t: "Spies report back from Canada"
 ice.46.d: "Our spies in Canada have reported back to us about the public opinion in Canada towards Iceland since the sinking of the Cumberland. In contrast to what we thought, the surprise attack did not discourage them but rather embolden them. They remain resolute in their commitment to Iceland. How should we proceed?"
 ice.46.a: "Blockade Iceland"
 ice.46.b: "Back Down"
 ice.47.t: "Free rein over the waters!"
 ice.47.d: "In an unexpected turn of events, the British have opted to back down from the skirmishes in the Icelandic waters. This places us as the undisputed masters of the waves around our island. Our fishermen are now free to resume catching fish without fear of any attacks from the Republican navy. We could not have done this without the aid of Canada."
 ice.47.a: "Britannia no longer rules the waves"
 ice.48.t: "Ships all across the horizon"
 ice.48.d: "This morning our merchants woke to a horrifying sight: the horizon filled with British warships. In a display of power, the British have stationed their supercarrier the Rebecca 5 miles off the shore from Reykjavik. Bombers have flown over Reykjavik dropping thousands of pamphlets that state that our trade with the Canadians is now at an end and that we are strongly advised to heed whatever demands the British send to us."
 ice.48.a: "Cut off from our friends in the west"
 ice.49.t: "North Sea Squadron Trapped"
 ice.49.d: "As the British descend on Iceland, our detachment of ships has become trapped in the Icelandic ports. Any attempt to break out of the blockade would be a bloodbath. They are effectively trapped."
 ice.49.a: "May God help them"
 ice.50.t: "아이슬란드 해상봉쇄"
 ice.50.d: "Our blockade over the course of the last week has been a great success. All trade with the royalists in Canada has ceased on Iceland. Our intelligence reports no action from the Canadians to relieve their trapped squadron of sailors in Iceland. We have Iceland right where we want them."
 ice.50.a: "A successful operation"
 ice.51.t: "Delivering the Demands"
 ice.51.d: "Following a two week period of blockade, their merchants and traders must be desperate for some ability to resume trade. We have proposed a treaty for them. In the deal, we press our claims over the waters, which naturally give us a sizeable portion of all profits that come from fish caught by Icelandic fishermen. Any disagreement with said policy would be seen as an attack against our sovereign waters and would be subject for military intervention."
 ice.51.a: "Force their hand"
 ice.52.t: "Britain offers a new deal"
 ice.52.d: "British merchants delivered an ultimatum to our merchants earlier today. They landed at Reykjavik and demanded a meeting with the prominent traders of Iceland. They brought with them a document in which they pressed their claims over the waters, which entitled them to a sizeable portion of all profits from fish caught by Icelandic fishermen. Any disagreement with their deal would be seen as an attack against their sovereign waters and they say they will not hesitate to send in the military to ensure we honour the bargain."
 ice.52.a: "Reject their extortion"
 ice.52.b: "We have no choice but to bow"
 ice.53.t: "Organising the Defence of Iceland"
 ice.53.d: "Following our rejection of their ridiculous demands, the British merchants left in a big huff of hot air. We don't expect they would make any empty threats after their raid on the Cumberland. Therefore, we must prepare for their incoming attack. How should we proceed?"
 ice.53.a: "To arms!"
 ice.53.b: "Organise an underground resistance"
 ice.54.t: "Iceland rejects our demands"
 ice.54.d: "With their rejection of our terms, we now have a justifiable excuse to land forces on their island. They have no military of any means and would have no means to resist us. Should we land a large force in a display of power, or use our resources elsewhere and deploy a smaller force?"
 ice.54.a: "Display our power"
 ice.54.b: "A small force will do the job"
 ice.55.t: "Iceland lies defeated"
 ice.55.d: "The Icelanders attempted to offer up resistance with the help of their Canadian allies at the beaches. They, however, were no match for our Republican marines who made short work of them. We now stand atop our conquered isle."
 ice.55.a: "Triumph"
 ice.56.t: "Uncontested Landing"
 ice.56.d: "Our forces have successfully landed on Iceland. The locals put up no resistance and we were able to quickly secure key positions throughout Reykjavik and take control of the island."
 ice.56.a: "Who can hope to stand against us?"
 ice.57.t: "Operation Fork Foiled!"
 ice.57.d: "We underestimated the tenacity of the Icelandic people. They were able to mount a sturdy defence with the aid of their Canadian allies and beat back our small landing parties into the sea. With this setback, we look like fools on the international scene with our failure to project power against a country as small as Iceland."
 ice.57.a: "How could this happen?"
 ice.58.t: "Defeat in Iceland"
 ice.58.d: "Our forces attempted to fight a pitched battle to retain control of Iceland. Unfortunately, the British came in too large numbers and were able to defeat us."
 ice.58.a: "Catastrophe!"
 ice.59.t: "Organise a commando resistance?"
 ice.59.d: "Without boots on the ground, our visible presence in Iceland has been finished. Should we attempt to send commandos to Iceland to help organise a local resistance against British rule?"
 ice.59.a: "A good idea"
 ice.59.b: "Too risky"
 ice.591.t: "Organise a commando resistance?"
 ice.591.d: "The people of Iceland are not content to lie under the heel of the Union of Britain. They have requested that we send a small force of commandos to help them drive off the British. Should we send them?"
 ice.591.a: "Send the men"
 ice.591.b: "The plan is too risky"
 ice.60.t: "Defeat in the field"
 ice.60.d: "We gambled everything we had on this one attempt to drive the British back. Despite our best efforts, the British simply kept coming and blew through our limited defenders. The British have been quick to implement martial law and our government does not have long until they receive a demand that they can not refuse."
 ice.60.a: "Once more under the yoke"
 ice.61.t: "Iceland's new government"
 ice.61.d: "With our conquest of the island, our delegations have been busy drafting up a new government for us to install on Iceland. The previously marginalised syndicalist population will be given control of a new Althing that ultimately answers to us."
 ice.61.a: "A new government for the island"
 ice.62.t: "British troops in Reykjavik"
 ice.62.d: "British troops landed on Iceland earlier today and quickly seized control of all the key government buildings. The Althing is expecting to receive demands from the Union of Britain any day now."
 ice.62.a: "We stood no chance"
 ice.63.t: "British troops beaten back"
 ice.63.d: "Our forces in Iceland successfully held off a British attack on the island. Their heroism will be remembered for a long time as revenge for the Cumberland!"
 ice.63.a: "Remember the Cumberland!"
 ice.64.t: "Successful defence of Iceland"
 ice.64.d: "Our Canadian allies were able to push the British back into the sea when they attempted a landing with a small contingent of troops. For now, the island retains its independence."
 ice.64.a: "Thanks to Canada!"
 ice.65.t: "The Icelandic Question"
 ice.65.d: "With the failure of our ground forces, the navy has come forward to offer their support for a new operation. This would involve sailing the Rebecca right off the port of Reykjavik and sending bombers to target their infrastructure and harbour facilities to demonstrate what we are capable of. This would likely draw the ire of the international community. Our other option would be to back down out of the waters and hope that this debacle fades from memory."
 ice.65.a: "Make an example of Iceland"
 ice.65.b: "Back Down"
 ice.66.t: "Britain backs down from the Atlantic"
 ice.66.d: "The representative from the Union of Britain has announced that the Union of Britain is withdrawing from its current affairs in the North Atlantic. This means we are free to align ourselves with our Canadian trade partners and protectors."
 ice.66.a: "Free from their tyranny"
 ice.67.t: "Reykjavik bombed!"
 ice.67.d: "Panic broke out overnight as the RNS Rebecca sailed up to the Reykjavik port and launched wave after wave of bombers. They struck with precision crippling what little infrastructure we have and the port facilities. Other waves dropped mass pamphlets that called for Iceland to adopt a policy of isolation in the Atlantic. It will take some time to rebuild this damage!"
 ice.67.a: "Luckily the people are alright"
 ice.74.t: "The Austerity Budget"
 ice.74.d: "As the markets start to hike their prices, we must turn inwards and try to reduce our reliance on imports from elsewhere."
 ice.74.a: "Moderate adherence to austerity!"
 ice.74.b: "A small austerity budget!"
 ice.75.t: "The Question of Fund Allocation"
 ice.75.d: "As our nation is thrown into great economic crisis, the people have cried out in a request for aid. Our coffers are very light so we will only be able to send a token gesture to one side. Who should we help relieve?"
 ice.75.a: "Support the Rural Areas"
 ice.75.b: "Support the Urban Area"
 ice.76.t: "Members of the Reykjavik Council protest"
 ice.76.d: "Over the past twenty years, the city of Reykjavik has more than doubled in population. With the crash of global imports post-Black Monday, the inhabitants are facing dire times. The Council has pleaded with us to help them if we find more money in the budget."
 ice.76.a: "If we find the money..."
 ice.76.b: "The rural population needs our help more"
 ice.77.t: "The Rural Population Protests"
 ice.77.d: "Since we have elected to give our resources to support the urban population of Iceland, the post has been filled with letters from the outlying communities with their complaints. They argue that their goods are what give those in the city jobs and that without the rural community, the urban community would be unable to survive."
 ice.77.a: "If we find the money..."
 ice.77.b: "A strong capital will share its wealth out later"
 ice.80.t: "Public Radio Broadcasts"
 ice.80.d: "People all across the Island have started to gather to listen to the Prime Minister speak on the radio. Almost all radios are tuned to hear him as he tells the people how the Althingi is taking steps to fix the instability that is facing their country."
 ice.80.a: "How Reassuring"
 ice.81.t: "Continue the Radio Broadcasts?"
 ice.81.d: "The people are greatly in favour of the radio broadcasts that have been given out to the nation to assure their worries over the course of the past year. Now we must ask ourselves if we wish to continue the broadcasts for another year."
 ice.81.a: "The people need the comfort"
 ice.81.b: "Our efforts are better spent elsewhere"
 ice.82.t: "아이슬란드의 재정 지원 요청"
 ice.82.d: "The government of Iceland has come forward to us with a request for financial assistance during this crisis that we find ourselves in after Black Monday. They claim that with the injection of Danish cash into the Icelandic economy, they will be able to finance their own recovery programmes. The amount that they ask for is relatively small due to the difference in population density between our two nations. Should we grant them this request?"
 ice.82.a: "우리 사람들을 도와줘야 한다!"
 ice.82.b: "그들이 스스로 해결해야 한다."
 ice.83.t: "덴마크의 재정 지원 제공"
 ice.83.d: "덴마크 정부는 우리의 간청을 듣고 품위 있게 대응하였습니다. 우리나라를 부흥할 구호 계획을 시작할 수 있는 매우 많은 액수의 돈을 우리에게 주었습니다!"
 ice.83.a: "고맙소, 덴마크!"
 ice.84.t: "덴마크의 지원 거부"
 ice.84.d: "우리가 덴마크의 구제를 요청하였을 때 간청은 받아들여지지 않았습니다. 그들은 경제 위기가 국내에 심각한 타격을 주고 있어서 우리에게 어떤 구제도 제공하기 어렵다고 주장합니다. 우리는 수중에 있는 것으로 버텨내야 할 것입니다."
 ice.84.a: "우리는 혼자 헤쳐 나가야 한다."
 ice.85.t: "A Charitable People"
 ice.85.d: "The people of Iceland have gone above and beyond to reach out a helping hand to their neighbours in need. Churches all across the island have started donation drives and opened their doors to any and all who come seeking help. If everyone could love their neighbour as much as these men and women do, then the world might just turn out to be a better place."
 ice.85.a: "May the Lord smile on their kindness"
 ice.86.t: "Running a Census"
 ice.86.d: "With our commitment to aiding the rural population, we need an accurate account of where they are located and in what numbers. Due to the general lack of communications infrastructure across the island, the census must be taken via messengers sent out from Reykjavik. Many generous herders near Reykjavik have offered some of their horses to be used to send riders off."
 ice.86.a: "Send out the riders"
 ice.87.t: "Sending Out Aid"
 ice.87.d: "With preliminary reports coming in, the aid for the rural population has begun to be doled out to the people. Carts and wagons are loaded up and then sent in teams out into the countryside to reach the more remote settlements on the island."
 ice.87.a: "They will surely appreciate this"
 ice.90.t: "Temperance Movement Protests"
 ice.90.d: "With the repeal of prohibition, the International Order of Good Templars have expressed their dissatisfaction with our recent policy change. They claim that this will lead to societal corruption as the tree of life and prosperity needs water, not alcohol."
 ice.90.a: "What is one drink here or there?"
 ice.91.t: "Reform the Taxes"
 ice.91.d: "As the government has taken a larger role in creating work opportunities for our people, we have increasingly run into budgetary restraints. With a new tax system, we can afford to continue these projects and keep people working"
 ice.91.a: "These tax dollars are needed for our government projects"
 ice.91.b: "No need"
 ice.100.t: "Reducing our Austerity Budget"
 ice.100.d: "It has been several years since the disastrous crash of Black Monday that threw our struggling economy into shambles. To that end, it is time to consider cutting back on the austerity budget that we have imposed on our people. The times have seen recent improvement in our situation that will allow us to start to slowly start reducing the severity of our budget. The people would surely appreciate this cutback. What shall we do?"
 ice.100.a: "Reduce our austerity budget"
 ice.100.b: "Stay at our current budget"
 ice.101.t: "Austerity Budget reduced, when should we revisit our situation?"
 ice.101.d: "With our recent reduction in the austerity budget, we have seen an increase in the people's lifestyles as they are once more able to enjoy a higher quality of life. Our next decision should be when we wish to revisit the issue."
 ice.101.a: "Let us look again in six months"
 ice.101.b: "Let us look again in one year"
 ice.102.t: "Austerity Budget not touched, when should we revisit our situation?"
 ice.102.d: "Our current policy is to keep our current level of austerity. While people may not like this, this will help keep the economy running. However, our next decision should be when we wish to revisit this issue."

While the harbour is too shallow for larger more modern vessels, the coastal town of Heimaey remains a crucial part of the cod fishing industry that is run off of the southern coast of Iceland. Already efforts are under way to streamline the transfer of catches from newer vessels to smaller ships that can bring the haul to the city for processing."

As such, they came along into Mitteleuropa and they remained in general in a course with us. However, Iceland's position makes their Mitteleuropa membership less than ideal, and as such, the island declined over the years. Under the dissent that this caused, Icelandic politicians had expedited the referendum, and the Icelandic people elected to end our relationship. A republic will be declared in Reykjavik and Iceland has let us know that they no longer need our foreign ministry to treat Icelanders as if they were Danes."

 ICE_country_intro_header: "1922년 아이슬란드"
 ICE_country_intro_content: "Starting in 1874, Iceland had its first taste of independence when Denmark granted the colony the right to home rule and a constitution. As a part of Denmark, Iceland remained neutral throughout the Weltkrieg. After the conclusion of the Weltkrieg, Iceland joined the Mitteleuropa Economic Bloc alongside its master Denmark.\n\nThis brought a period of prosperity to the island nation as Iceland could now tap into two markets for its main export: fish. The British market continued its lucrative fish imports from Iceland due to the distance between the two islands. Meanwhile, the entry of Icelandic Cod into the European Market became a source of smaller additional funds to help boost Iceland’s economy."
 ICE_country_intro_header_1: "1925년 아이슬란드"
 ICE_country_intro_content_1: "However, this economic prosperity would not last forever. The British Revolution of 1925 shattered the miracle that post-weltkrieg Iceland was experiencing. As the royalists fled to various corners of the Empire, the British-Icelandic trade route instantly ran dry. The only close remainders of the cod trade were the royalists who fled to Canada but they had more pressing economic issues than resuming Icelandic trade.\n\nThus, Iceland was left wallowing in the wake of the British Revolution which saw the country's exports to Britain dry completely. The Mitteleuropan market has helped Icelandic fishermen somewhat, but the economy has been slow to adjust."
 ICE_country_intro_header_2: "1932년 아이슬란드"
 ICE_country_intro_content_2: "To help put a stopgap on the massive unemployment that started to rise in the country, the Althing created the City Work-Creation Scheme to put the people to work on manual labour construction projects. This worked for some time but eventually became a divisive topic between the parties in the government.\n\nDuring a city council meeting on the 9th of November 1932, the council debated pulling the plug on the project. News of this reached the population who arrived in droves to riot in front of the building demanding that the Scheme remains in place due to the fact that the economic recession still continued to afflict Iceland. This riot became known as Gúttóslagurinn and ensured that the CWCS remains in effect for the near future of the country."
 ICE_country_intro_header_3: "1936년 아이슬란드"
 ICE_country_intro_content_3: "While the past decade has been a disaster for the people of Iceland, there still remains a hope for a brighter future over the horizon. Prospective government officials have started crafting plans for large scale public works projects to provide jobs, kick-starting a tourism industry, or even looking into tapping into the geothermal and hydroelectric resources that our island provides us with. Perhaps with a little assistance from Denmark, we can make these dreams come true!"
