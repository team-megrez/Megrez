 JAP_Hirasawa_Susumu: "시라사와의 히라사와 스스무"
 POLITICS_HIRASAWA_SUSUMU_DESC: "The most fabulous tales are told about the Planet Observer: how he saved Princess Aurora from Binary Descartes, how he smashed through the layers of the imitation city of Bangkok, how he built many bridges to the WORLD CELL, how he was the pilot of the Logic Air Force who saved Astro-Hue! from Planet Roll Call, how he was the sister-personae who destroyed the ZCON located in an evil timeline where model slaves were created, etc.\n\nThese stories might be true or false, I personally don't know. I haven't had the chance to test the \"Kalashnikov\" in Japanese metro katakombes, but Hirasawa at his core is a deep ecologist musician who had brought an electricity generator called \"graviton\" to his concerts. Nicknamed \"the Teacher\", Hirasawa is a man deeply concerned about the issues of his time. He has seen how bureaucracy has stopped with red-tape the reformists who fight for the changes that Japan needs, he has seen how capitalism has reduced the worker to a non-human creature and raped nature, he has seen how the Mother Earth is deeply worried about her sons finally destroying all of her beauty trough nuclear war, he has seen how there is a cabal of miserable who control the scene from behind. And what is worse, this deep state seems to be in cahoots with the eternal enemy of humanity, the United States of America. Those fat eagles fuckeads.\n\nAnd so, he is now here. To deal with all of that? Yes. But the main reason he is here, the reason why you, HoI4 player, are reading his bio, is that you saw his ideology wheel. Your eyes caught the sight of a \"Shinto ultranat esonaz Japan\" and your pants got wet. \"My wholesome traditionalist samurai Japan is back\". But you are a fool. Hirasawa is not the personification of the weeaboo fantasy, he is a progressive who has spoken in favor of sexual minorities. He only takes the idea of \"bashing the fash\" and changes it to \"bashing the polluters\".\n\nAnd now you have reached the end of his bio, and if you reached this point, if you loved the idea of his beliefs so much, then why in hell are you messing up with a mod for a strategy game instead of listening to his works? He has already put up two of his albums onto the bandcamp and you can buy them for approximately 23 dollars each (don't ping me if I mistake the price). If you are an otaku who says \"meh sanjigen male\" then you can also take a look at one of the K-On! episodes. Although Hirasawa claimed that \"I'm Hirasawa Susumu, not Hirasawa Yui\", we all know that he is the father of Hirasawa Yui, just like Akiyama Kazuhiko to Mio, Tainaka Sadatoshi to Ritsu, Kotobuki Hikaru to Tsumugi and Nakano Teruo to Azusa."

 HIRASAWA_NEWS.1.desc: "Outlandish news from Japan. Amidst a suspicious cry of \"BIIIG EYE\", Japan's most important political and military figures have vanished into thin air (read: the streets, recently decorated with their corpses).\n\nFrom this chaos a savior has emerged: Hirasawa Susumu, \"the Planet Observer\". Thanks to his \"Horse Bones\" paramilitaries he has managed to outflank the rest of the sussy bakas who also wanted to take advantage of the power vacuum. But Hirasawa shouldn't be taken as just another opportunist, as he has le very based(TM) plans about destroying the bureaucracy, capitalism and the Greater Satan (the US), all while writing a Love Song to Mother Earth.\n\nFor this task he has spawned units of Brahma-crafts, Logic Air Forces, and Yin-Yang Robots, which are dope as fuck.\n"
