 POLITICS_CONNIE_MULDER_DESC:0 "Connie Mulder is a disillusioned man. For years, he worked to bring the National Party to power, first as a councilman, then as a mayor, and finally, as an officer during the war. Even more so, he was one of the Transvaal Boer's most pro-German politicians, staunchly opposing any expansion of American influence into South Africa. Yet for all of this, he now leads the revolt against those he wished to see rule.\n\nMulder watched in horror as the Boer Republic which he helped bring about was torn apart between its slavish loyalty to Hüttig's regime in Bouhlerstadt, the ceaseless native resistance to its existence, and the extremists in the Volksraad. Slowly but surely, the former teacher established connection with United Party politicians, knowing full well the regime couldn't last. Then came the overthrow of Hertzog, and it was worse than Mulder imagined.\n\nWhen the fragile government collapsed in the face of Malan's coup, Mulder was the only man with connections to both Boer loyalists and United Party politicians, and so he was unanimously elected President of a restored South Africa, with all three votes. In a sense, Mulder is little more than a puppet for the special interests who back his government, whose ultimate end is to restore the pre 1964 constitution. However, he also personifies the factionalism that the reborn South African state suffers from: As a lifelong segregationist, he is at odds with the remnants of the United Party who wish to use the war as an opportunity to end the practice once and for all."
 POLITICS_CONSTAND_VILJOEN_DESC:0 "In theory, Connie Mulder's restored South African government can count on the loyalty of the Union Defense Forces (UDF). As with most things in South Africa, reality is far more convoluted.\n\nConstand Viljoen belongs to a clique of younger officers who despised the Graff's government unwillingness to compromise with the native population. Although he initially defected to the Boers at the outbreak of the War, the entry of the Afrika-Schild and the volksraad submission to Hüttig caused him to rescind his betrayal and rejoin the Union Defense Forces. From there, he rose to prominence as one of the UDF's most competent military commanders.\n\nViljoen was intelligent enough to go into hiding once it became obvious that the Schild would win the war. From his internal exile, Viljoen made clear his view that it was the politicians and their racial inflexibility that had lost South Africa, and later the Boer Republic, its freedom. Now in control of the lion's share of the reborn UDF, Viljoen is determined to prevent this from happening again. To many, Viljoen's bizarre claim that a Boer state is not incompatible with majority african rule carry the implication that he wishes for a federated South Africa.\n\nAlmost immediately, the general's insistence on closer cooperation with native African forces caused a break with the Cape Town government, from which the SALF is effectively independent. While Hüttig's agents and Malan's Boers remain Viljoen's immediate concern, the General's ultimate aim is to create a new multiracial order that will prevent South Africa from being divided and conquered ever again. If Mulder, the natives, or anyone else proves an obstacle to this, Viljoen won't hesitate to turn his guns on them."
 POLITICS_MANGOSUTHU_BUTHELEZI_DESC:0 "The abject failure of the ANC to prevent a Boer takeover of South Africa proved to be the last straw for the organization's moderate faction. As the ANC's leaders were killed or exiled by Hertzog's regime, the ensuing power struggle for the organization's remnants was won by none other than Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi.\n\nOfficially only the hereditary leader of the Buthelezi tribe, Prince Mangosuthu is the de facto leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the largest ANC splinter group. Mangosuthu and the chief ideolouges of the IPF are steadfast in their belief that the ANC's extremism was the root of its failure, and that only by cooperating with sympathetic white governments will racial parity be achieved. In spite of this moderation, the IPF goals are no less radical than those of the ANC, and the backlash from the Boer's horrific treatment of South Africa's natives has only further convinced the tribal leaders who prop-up Mangosuthu's government that segregation has to end, one way or another.\n\nThe thin line the Prince has to walk between ideological radicalism and his pragmatic strategy is represented by the unstable alliance of tribes that make up Mangosuthu's political front. While it is little more than an informal arrangement upheld almost entirely by personal loyalty to Mangosuthu, at a disadvantage in industrial capacity and military experience, the alliance nevertheless carries with it the ANC's unbreakable spirit. This makes an arrangement with Viljoen's moderate whites all the more pressing, for should Mangosuthu prove unable to fulfill his promises of a negotiated end to segregation, the IFP's more extremist elements could gain the upper hand."
 POLITICS_BEYERS_NAUDE_DESC:0 "Peace at any cost is the official doctrine of the Carnarvon Defense League, and of its leader.\n\nWhile Beyers Naudé himself was a segregationist long ago, the extremist attitudes of his fellow Boers, and the religious conviction of many ANC members, convinced the theologian that he was rooting for the wrong side. By the time of the Cape Town massacre, the cleric had established connections with underground ANC leaders, something which earned him the ire of Hertzog's secret policemen. Nevertheless, Naudé refused to go into hiding and continued to publicly criticize the government, an act that greatly increased the ANC's opinion of him.\n\nOnce Malan's coup set off Connie Mulder's rebellion in Cape Town, Naudé's allies, white and black, seized control of the Northern Cape from the rapidly collapsing Boer security forces. Naudé's deeply religious understanding of South Africa resulted in his calls for a restoration of the pre war constitution, an end to segregation, co-operation between blacks and whites, expelling the Germans, and a federated structure for South Africa. His vision for a reconstructed South Africa convinced just about every major faction that Naudé was their natural ally.\n\nHowever, neither Mulder, nor Viljoen, nor Buthelezi could have predicted the establishment of the Carnarvon Defense League as a neutral zone. Armed to the teeth, Naudé has made it clear that the League will guarantee a safe place for those who wish to evade further suffering from war. Whether the League will weather the storm and remain intact is an open question, but Naudé's position as the most idealistic of contestants for the future of South Africa is already secured."
 POLITICS_KARL_CHMIELEWSKI_DESC:0 "Karl Chmielewski was always considered to be below average in all aspects except one: cruelty.\n\nChmielewski once had a promising career in the German SS, as one of the few Camp Kommandants whose delight in torturing prisoners unsettled even Reinhard Heydrich. However, his excessive graft and violations of SS regulations ended his career with a permanent reassignment to Hüttig's Ostafrika. Here, he was no one.\n\nFor years, the disgraced Camp Kommandant tried to gain the Reichskommissar's approval, to no avail. Even his plot to assassinate Ian Smith backfired when it interfered with his boss's plans. A lackluster performance as a corps commander during the South African War seemed like his last posting, until Malan's rebellion forced Hüttig to intervene in the country once more.\n\nSince Hüttig's more competent generals were busy administering his domain, Chmielewski was the only one left to put down the Boer rebellion. With little more than a full division and hatred for the Germans at an all time high, Chmielewski knows that regaining control of the country is impossible, but he will at least try to evacuate as many German resources as possible before he is beaten back."

When Hüttig's goons had taken over the country, his Jewish background made him an overnight wanted criminal, but the authorities in the Boer Republic knew better than to arrest the owner of the largest mining corporation. Nevertheless, German rule was not kind to the business of diamond trading. The continuing embargo and arbitrary taxation was cutting into his profit margins. As it turned out, it was cutting into DeBeer's ability to operate at all.\n\n\"There's nothing to be done.\" Oppenheimer said it to no one in particular. No matter what financial wizardry he undertook, there was no escaping the looming insolvency.

McCain gestured the appropriate hand movements to his men on the other side of the dirt road, covered in the same amount of foliage. Their figures merged into the green leaves, with only the most careful onlooker being able to notice the blackness of their gun's barrels.\n\nMcCain waited for their appearance, and then waited some more. So obsessed was he with spotting the figure of a uniformed man on the road that he almost missed the sound of a branch cracking under the pressure of a boot in the trees behind him. A shot rang out, and then some more, one of his men must have spotted the figures descending from the mound. Barely avoiding the bullets himself, McCain managed to shout, \"HOLD YOUR FIRE,\" in time to avoid any serious problems to arise from the incident.\n\n\"Are you done yet, Lieutenant?\" from behind a bush some two hundred meters up the small hill, the recognizable British accent called out to him. After a few moments of silence, the helmeted figure emerged from the same spot. \"Well, would have been a shame to get killed here after all the effort it took us to get into Mozambique in the first place.\" Why anyone in his right mind would try to get into Africa was beyond McCain's capability to understand, but DeBeers had made him a promise: Help the mercenaries in, and they'd help him get his men out, eventually.

With the American fleet having blocked any action on its part throughout the entirety of the South African War, it had gained little of status or glory in the eyes of Hans Hüttig. Even after that it proved too small to have a major contribution in helping the beleaguered SS to combat the endless numbers of uprisings that assailed it. Worst of all: It was falling apart at the seams.\n\nIt had been years since the last shipment of spare parts from the Heimat, and the ships of the Afrikaner Kriegsmarine, already old in 1962, were beginning to malfunction. Boiler breakdowns, broken hydraulic systems on turrets, and leaks had long been a problem, and the inadequate dockyards of Kongo and Mozambique were not helping the situation, either. Germany had never invested into these ports with the intention of making them into self-sufficient naval bases, and the consequences of that were now beginning to show. The atrophied machinery of the steel behemoths which once guarded Deutsch-Afrika desperately needed maintenance, and there was only one place in the continent were it could get it.\n\nFor Wilhelm Dommes, it was ironic that the last refuge of the fleet would be Cape Town. For the two decades, while his career had stagnated in Ostafrika, he and Rolf Mutzenberg spent many a general staff meeting planning the glorious day in which the Kriegsmarine would take the largest port south of Suez. Now, he led the decrepit remains of an outlaw fleet into indefinite mothballitude.\n\nLooking out from the bridge of his flagship, Dommes saw Daressalam fade away into the distance. He would have taken the opportunity to desert, he'd worked with the Japanese during the war... still on friendly terms with some of their admirals... but there wasn't enough fuel. For now, all that remained was to reach Simonstown Naval base scavenge whatever the OFN had left behind and hadn't been destroyed during the reconquest of the Vasallenstaat."

 TER_SAF_CW.6.desc:0 "Winnie Madikizela hadn't wanted things to go this far, and yet they had. Why did they not recognize her? The leadership of the ANC should have gone to no one else but to her! She, who had kept the organization alive in the Eastern Cape, who had prepared its legions in preparation for the Rising, and she, who had been passed over so another dreadful ideologue could take the position. Well, she wouldn't take it, in fact, she couldn't: They would not let her.\n\nThe Madikizela United Foot Ball Club, an innocuous name for the monstrosity she had let flourish under her watch, now consumed its progenitor. While it had always proved troublesome, the club's activities in racketeering, human trafficking, extortion, and kidnapping started growing out of control only after the Second War. Winnie had done nothing to stop them, she saw no point in it, the ANC needed its enforcers. When Mugabe's men from across the border offered their help to the organization, it seemed only natural. By the time the Germans desperately retreated southwards, the organization was unrecognizable, and as Madikizela now found out, uncontrollable.\n\nShe tried desperately to plead with her lieutenants, and yet they wouldn't listen, she was their stalking horse for control of the ANC, and they were Mugabe's. All her efforts to maintain regimented control over the Cape had been successful, yet had turned her into a puppet of those same men she had entrusted with carrying it out.\n\nFrom outside the walls of her gilded cage, Madikizela can hear the screams of those who suffer under the consequences of her actions: The innocent men and women, black and white, adults and children. While all lay dead under the deranged version of Mugabified nationalism which few of the perpetrators have any understanding of."

 TER_SAF_CW.7.desc:0 "The cratered landscape of Ventersdorp showed symptoms of the three wars which had ravaged it in less than a decade: The imprint of tank tracks upon the torn-up pavement, the vegetation uprooted by shells, the vast fields made fallow by chemical weapons, and, most obviously, on the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging rally at its central plaza.\n\nAfter a decade of permanent war, there were few Boers left, so few that those which remained became scared enough to support the demented movement of a former policeman few could have recognized in 1962. Eugène Terre'Blanche had predicted demographic apocalypse for his people for years, and now that it had come true, there was no one else to lead them out of it. Surely, some race-traitors joined in with that Jew, Oppenheimer, others with the weak, degenerate cowards in Simonstown, but the true Boers had flocked to him. As Terre'Blanche prepared to give his speech, he looked besides him: Standing atop the same Leopard tank as him was Adam Grünewald, who had chosen to join the true heirs of the Reichsstaat, alongside the rest of his SS Panzerdivision.\n\nWhile he raged against the race traitors, the Americans, the ANC, and all others who dared oppose him, Terre'Blanche didn't miss the opportunity to reference the piled up bodies of ANC sympathizers liquidated by the new Boer Liberation Army. When Terre'Blanche finished his speech and made way for Robert van Tonder's turn at the microphone, he took a big breath. Remembering the hectic days of the First South African War, he shook his head: He'd trusted the Boer Republic, that was a mistake. Hüttig was right, only a pure Africa would do, and he was determined to succeed where he had failed, even if only in this little corner of the continent."
