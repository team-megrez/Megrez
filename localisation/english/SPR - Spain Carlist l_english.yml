 SPR_emergency_factories_desc: "Success and victory does not come to those who are slothful, but to the hard workers who devote themselves to God. To win the ongoing war all of our workers must be fully committed to the cause, and syndicalist concepts like 'workplace safety guidelines' must be abandoned if our cause is to succeed."

 SPR_weltrieg_lessons: "Armoured Warfare Tactics"
 SPR_weltrieg_lessons_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed to everybody the potential use of tanks. Combined with motorised or mechanised support, tanks can excel at the purpose they were designed to achieve; to catch the enemy by surprise. Unlike in the Weltkrieg, where tanks were massive and vulnerable targets, a much more mobile approach is needed."
 SPR_tank_shipments: "Request Entente Tank Shipments"
 SPR_tank_shipments_desc: "If we are to win this ongoing war, we will need as many tanks as possible deployed to the battlefield. Our allies in the Entente still have significant stockpiles of tanks that haven't seen action since their revolutions, which we can likely convince them to send to us instead so that they may finally be of use once again."

 SPR_foreign_airplanes_desc: "Our country is not really in the position to manufacture an air force. For this reason, we must purchase old planes from abroad to help kickstart the Spanish Air Force. The air war is likely to become of greater importance as the Weltkrieg had suggested decades ago."

 SPR_javier_de_borbon_parma_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gMay 25th, 1889, in Lucca, Kingdom of Italy\n§YPolitical Career:§! Inheriting a dynastic legacy over a century in the making, Francisco Javier de Borbón-Parma y de Braganza has ascended to the head of the Carlist branch of the Borbón dynasty as the designated successor of Duke Alfonso Carlos. Having been proclaimed as King Javier I of Spain by the supporters of Carlism, he has been given the difficult task of cementing his claim to the throne and reconciling a destructively divided nation.\n\nWhile to many in the nation, Javier is king of the Spanish people, it would be hard to describe the man himself as a Spaniard. As the son of Robert I, deposed Duke of Parma, Javier was born in the Kingdom of Italy yet immersed deeply in French culture from birth owing to his family's dynastic origins. Until the death of Alfonso Carlos, Javier's only direct experience of Spain had been brief holidays and familial visits to distant dynastic relatives.\n\nBeing the brother in law of Kaiser Karl I of Austria, Javier initially planned to join the Austrian army to support their fight against Serbia. However seeing himself as a Frenchman above all else, France's entry into the war would eventually lead to him instead enlisting alongside his brother Sixtus in the Belgian army, having been blocked from joining France's as a foreign royal. Still however valuing his family, Javier aided his brother in Karl I's disastrous attempt to negotiate a secret peace with the Entente.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the war Javier chose to remain initially in France, staying in one of his family's castles in the country. With the outbreaks of uprisings across the nation and soon Europe as a whole, Javier and other members of the Borbón-Parma dynasty sought refuge with their relatives from the Two Sicily's branch of the family in Naples. There he would remain until his arrival in Spain in the lead up to the nation's civil war.\n\nWith Javier now ruling as a practical foreigner on a much disputed throne, only time will tell if he can truly ingratiate himself with the Spanish people and help finally heal the greatly fractured country."
