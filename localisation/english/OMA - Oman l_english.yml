 OMA_foreign_naval_officers_desc: "Just because we have the ships doesn't mean we know how to use them well. Let's offer a high salary to a few foreign officers who can teach our sailors how to make the best of our new navy!"
 OMA_royal_army_reform: "왕립 육군 개혁"
 OMA_royal_army_reform_desc: "What remains of our army was designed to deal with tribal uprisings, not the larger scale warfare we seem to be moving towards. We need to reform our units to deal with such engagements."
 OMA_the_saudi_threat: "북쪽에서의 위협"
 OMA_the_saudi_threat_desc: "Be it Saudi's or others, those to the North have always had designs on the entire Arabian Peninsula. Let's fortify the obvious areas of attack to deter potential aggression."
 OMA_muscat_armament_plan: "무스카트 무장 계획"
 OMA_muscat_armament_plan_desc: "We have a plan for how our ground forces will engage the enemy, but they will need arms to do so. We need a new factory dedicated to producing military hardware for our divisions."
 OMA_artillery_purchases: "야포 구입"
 OMA_artillery_purchases_desc: "Guns only shoot so far. Fighting on the open ground of the desert we need long range artillery to destroy enemy forces before they engage ours. The best way to acquire this is to petition a foreign government for prototypes."
 OMA_infantry_equipment_reorganization: "Infantry Equipment Reorganisation"
 OMA_infantry_equipment_reorganization_desc: "The Weltkrieg rifles our units are currently using are breaking down in the field, and our diplomats have come back with far more advanced weapons from other countries. It's time to update our equipment from at least this decade."

 OMA_dealing_with_tribal_militias_desc: "The tribes in the outlying desert areas have been sapping our manpower and state support for far too long. They need to be dealt with, and swiftly, if we are to get our armed forces into fighting shape."
 OMA_regular_regiments: "정규군"
 OMA_regular_regiments_desc: "Our former tribal units are equipped with a wide variety of arms and sundries. This has made it expensive to re-equip regiments in the field, as we don't always know what they need. Standardising a field kit will increase the effectiveness of our units and reduce attrition, since we can pick and choose the best for our men."
 OMA_hierarchy_reorganization: "군사 위계 재조직"
 OMA_hierarchy_reorganization_desc: "We need to have a better top-down organisation of our chain of command, to better facilitate fast, accurate decision making. Having a few people make the major decisions and implement our grand strategy is the best way to do this."

 OMA_tax_reform_desc: "We need to standardise the way we collect taxes from the populace, and potentially separate it from the tithe that the Imam collects.

 OMA_economical_reform_planning: "경제 재조직 시작"
 OMA_economical_reform_planning_desc: "Vast tracts of land are under the protection of the Imam and other members of our oligarchy. If we open this land up for business development, our greatest entrepreneurial minds will find the best use for it."

 OMA_taxate_the_hinterlands_desc: "Now that we have a standardised tax system, we need to get our collectors out from the urban areas into remote villages and tribal communities in the desert. Incorporating the outlying areas wasn't cheap, and they have to bear some of the burden."

 OMA_loyalty_to_the_imam_desc: "We have tribal warlords, rich business leaders, and powerful religious figures, all doing whatever they want and destabilising our great nation.

Let us establish a solid state company for managing rail networks, and lay the ties for the first line through the capital to some outlying areas immediately."
 OMA_dhofar_railway: "도파르 철도"
 OMA_dhofar_railway_desc: "Now that we have at least one major rail line though Muscat itself, we need to integrate the rest of Oman with this rail line. Goods and citizens from as far away as Dhofar will be able to get across the entire country in less than a day's travel. Of course this stands to benefit our military as well, as faster transportation means faster troops!"
 OMA_port_of_muscat: "무스카트 항구"
 OMA_port_of_muscat_desc: "We have always been a sea trading society, and while our rail makes moving products easier in the country, the real profit comes from when we export goods by sea.

 OMA_local_manufactury_incentives: "지역 생산 장려"
 OMA_local_manufactury_incentives_desc: "We need to provide local incentives in Oman to utilise all the spare labour the state cannot effectively utilise. Manufacturing all the small things citizens need, including appliances and tools, cheap clothing and the like, will reduce our imports and expand our trading opportunities with our trade partners."
 OMA_commerce_industrialization_plan: "상공업 계획"
 OMA_commerce_industrialization_plan_desc: "Providing incentives to small military manufacturing companies will allow them to expand their production base, speeding up the process of industrialising the process of manufacturing military vehicles and small arms. We need more military factories if we are to keep up with our increasingly aggressive neighbours!"
 OMA_intensify_administration_plan: "산업 계획 강화"
 OMA_intensify_administration_plan_desc: "We are confident that with our current industrial plan we will be able to expand our military capacity in an adequate fashion. It still remains to be seen if we can keep up with an increasing middle class and their ever larger demand for commercial goods. To keep the people pacified, let's provide the same incentives to civilian companies that we do to military ones."
 OMA_finish_economical_plan: "경제 계획의 끝"

 OMA_royal_navy_cooperation_desc: "Canada is now leading the Entente, and focusing on building larger ships of the line.

 OMA_a_special_relationship: "특별한 관계"
 OMA_a_special_relationship_desc: "India has offered to help us run our government in a way that will benefit the Entente. We hesitate at such a bargain in return for our freedom, but the alternative, total annihilation, is not a real option. Let us bend the knee to India in return for our freedom! Others will not be as kind, and our old new overlords will let the Imam keep his place as the head of state."
 OMA_porte_assistance: "The Rauf Pasha Mission"
 OMA_porte_assistance_desc: "It is a harsh truth that we cannot face the strength of the Saudis by ourselves. If we don't want Muscat to fall to the invaders, we must accept the military expedition the Sublime Porte has offered us, as difficult as it might be to convince ourselves of the good intentions of the Ottomans."
 OMA_military_reform: "오스만식 군사개혁 시행"
 OMA_military_reform_desc: "The mission led by admiral Rauf Pasha has shown us the inadequate state of our military, both in organisation and tactics. With the assistance of the Ottomans, we can kickstart a modernisation of our army."
 OMA_revise_budget: "Reorganise the Administration"
 OMA_revise_budget_desc: "Among the things we should adopt from our new benefactors is their drive to modernise their government. It is necessary for us to begin a grand reorganisation of our administration, to make it more functional and suitable for modern times."
 OMA_freedom_once_more: "Dismantle the Protectorate"
 OMA_freedom_once_more_desc: "With the Saudi threat gone, we don't need the protection of the Ottomans anymore. It's time for Rauf Pasha to return to Basra, and for us to recover our precious independence."
 oma.1.a: "좋아."
 oma.10.t: "Imam loyalists refuse to pay taxes"
 oma.10.d: "The Imamate has long been exempting its loyalists from paying their taxes to our administers which has led to outcry from the citizens who do pay their share.

 oma.12.a: "빨리 해결되기를 빌자.."
 oma.14.t: "알 부라이미 오아시스에서 행진하는 이븐 사우드"
 oma.14.d: "Placed on the border between Muscat and the former Trucial States, ownership over the Oasis has been a contested affair for many generations between the Sultans of Muscat and the Emirs further North. With the conquest of the latter by Ibn Saud, he has also taken over these old claims and is using them for his own machinations.\n\nIt is no secret however that Ibn Saud is not planning to stop his advance after taking the Oasis and by claiming that we were once part of the great Wahhabist state, he will surely not stop until the city of Muscat is ablaze and the vile Ikhwan has slaughtered all that oppose him.\n\nThe threat posed by Ibn Saud however has ensured better relations between the Imam and the Sultan as despite their differences, they both strongly adhere to Omani particularism and will stop at nothing to defend their homeland from the invaders."

 OMA_indian_business_ties_desc: "Now that we're once again under the British umbrella, we can access extra funding from influential Indian entrepreneurs. Convincing them to invest in [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] shouldn't be very hard."
 OMA_said_ibn_taimur_leader_desc: "The Al Said dynasty, which had reaped the benefits of British support in the 19th century, still lives. Following the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, the young Said bin Taimur accelerated through his political education in Muscat. The former Sultan Taimur bin Feisal had prepared a wise council for his son in 1935 when he abdicated the throne. Said bin Taimur was left with a sense of superiority over the Shia in the Trucial coast and the Ibadi tribesman in Oman proper. More concerning was the new Sultan's attitude towards Dhofaris. Said bin Taimur has taxed them mercilessly, and remained silent to the slave trade that oppresses Dhofar."
 OMA_country_intro_header: "Introduction to Oman"
 OMA_country_intro_content: "Oman's splendid isolation did not end with the Weltkrieg and the Sultan hoped it wouldn't end any time soon. However, the wheel of fate stops for no one, and their protectors in Britain and India fell into utter and complete disarray. With Ottoman forces moving into the Trucial States, and an ever more aggressive Ibn Saud in Nejd, it seemed war was coming fast to Oman, and the tale of the Ibadi Sultanate was to finally end.\n\nHowever, the much feared war never came. The warriors mobilised by the state never saw battle against the Ikhwan and the Saudis... Perhaps Ibn Saud has other, more obscure plans in his mind? Regardless of reason, Oman stood alone, and has not received aid from British India in a decade. This may very well become an extremely worrisome state of affairs as instability rapidly spreads throughout the region.\n\nBut to properly fight external threats, internal ones must be properly dealt with. More specifically the Imamate of Oman, and the tribes that have their allegiance to the Hinterlands Imam higher than to Muscat; not to mention the degraded and archaic state of the Monarchy. But if these challenges can be overcome, Oman's tale is not to end so soon."
