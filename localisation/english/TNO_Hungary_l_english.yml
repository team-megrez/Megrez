 POLITICS_BELA_IMREDY_DESC:0 "Béla vitéz Imrédy de Ómoravicza is the man whose slow but steady rise to power shaped Hungarian politics for decades, first in the shadow of Miklós Horthy, and finally stepping into the light. A skilled economist and administrator, Imrédy was made Director of the Hungarian National Bank in 1928, before becoming Minister of Finance in the 1930s. His unbridled ambition and political cunning drove him to become one of the most powerful men in Hungary, leading the most hardliner right wing faction of the Party of Hungarian Life, before becoming prime minister in 1938.\n\nSince then, during and after World War Two, Imrédy was the evil genius of the Horthy government - his influence slowly spreading as he suppressed potential rivals, pushed for more totalitarian reforms, restricted freedom of press and culture, and passed harsh antisemitic legislation, all in an effort to become a more loyal German ally. In an ironic twist of fate, his pro-German stance ended with an inter Pakt war between Romania and Hungary, resulting in both countries leaving the Pakt. However, when admiral Horthy finally died in 1957, Imrédy was one of the few men in Hungary with enough clout to enter the race for succession - a race which he won.\n\nBéla Imrédy's final nomination as Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary, approved by Parliament with a strong majority, was the final achievement in his slow, methodical and bloody rise to power - which coincided with Hungary's gradual fall into disaster. As the economy is still in crisis and Germany maintains a large degree of influence over the Magyar state, only time will tell if the new Regent will able to restore Hungary to its former glory, or seal its final doom."

 ### Ideas ###
 HUN_az_kormanypart:0 "A Kormánypárt"
 HUN_az_kormanypart_desc:0 "Founded in 1922 as the Unity Party, the Party of Hungarian Life (or MEP) has been nicknamed "the government party" because of its nearly uncontested domination of Hungarian politics for the whole duration of its history. A somewhat diverse grouping of fascists, conservatives, monarchists and nationalists, the MEP unified under the charismatic admiral Horthy, but now that a new and much more radical Regent is in charge factionalism within the party is beginning to truly flare up, with internal opposition to Imrédy reaching worrisome levels. What's worse, the other Hungarian parties, never completely outlawed but totally marginalized by MEP hegemony, are beginning to challenge its power - and voices for a restoration of true democracy in Hungary are growing louder and louder."

 HUN_suffocated_economy:0 "Suffocated Economy"
 HUN_suffocated_economy_desc:0 "Since the conflict with Romania in the 1950s and Hungary's expulsion from Pakt member status, the country has been mired in a devastating economic crisis. Its industry dominated by German investment, its agriculture outcompeted by the slave plantations and fields of Ukraine and Eastern Europe, and its trade strangled by unequal treaties with the Pakt and the Triumvirate, not even Imrédy's financial skills could save the Hungarian economy from collapse - greatly tarnishing the Regent's popularity."

 HUN_der_volksbund:0 "Der Volksbund"
 HUN_der_volksbund_desc:0 "The Volksbund der Deutschen in Ungarn was formed in 1938 as a political association designed to represent ethnic Germans in Hungary. An openly and unapologetically Nazi organization, the Volksbund is a power to be reckoned with in Hungarian politics - enjoying near total support from the German minority (amounting to almost a tenth of the Hungarian population) and maintaining permanent representation in Parliament. However, the high living standard enjoyed by Germans and the suspicions of Abwehr and SS activity connected to the Volksbund have led many Hungarians of all strata of society to resent, more or less openly, the Germans and the Volksbund, and despite the facade of peace, ethnic tensions in the country have never been higher."
