Smaller towns and villages find themselves often host to bandits or local warlords. These groups take what the want and move on, leaving destruction in their wake. As such, isolated industrial complexes that handle volatile materiel, and thus must be away from civilization, make ideal targets. Chemical plants and other such important industries have seen many factories raided or destroyed by roving bands of marauders, and while this problem persists, it will be much harder to convince American corporations to invest here. Thus, it becomes necessary to protect these factories as if they were military outposts. Every factory shall have at least a platoon of American soldiers to oversee and protect it from outside harm such that a raid, or worse, a takeover, is rendered almost impossible."

With much of the chemical industry going to Dow Chemical, the weapons and arms sector lies relatively clear of private interests. Thus, we can create the Eastern Arms Company- a new corporation that would produce weapons and supplies for soldiers not just in East Africa, but across the OFN. We could easily invite some savvy American business magnates and entrepreneurs to chair the board, and we already have the factories to produce the equipment, so the operation should be relatively low risk, with the potential for high reward."

If the new OFN Interim Government is to maintain a semblance of peace and stability, it must show the population that it is different than the old Nazi regime. Workers shall be paid wages, Africans shall have a say in governance, and the deliberate mistreatment of the land and its people shall be put to an end. While these may seem obvious solutions to native unrest, the people of East Africa have been seeing white Westerners exploit and rape their homeland for more than a century.

Many local populations have asked for the camps to be fully destroyed, not only to ensure that they never re-open, but also to remove a dark memory that continues to pollute the land. Recognizing the opportunity for good publicity, Westmoreland and his staff have decided to quite literally blow up the remaining labor camps on live television.

According to many, often contradictory witness statements, these old SS officers are low on almost every resource but sheer brutality. Many villages in more isolated territories report attacks from well armed white men, still flying the colors of Hüttig's Reichskommissariat. If these reports and rumors are true, these remnants present a clear and imminent danger to the stability and security of the OFN Interim Government, for if they can continue operations, they will drastically lower the confidence of the native population in the OFN's military capabilities. In light of such danger, Westmoreland and the general staff plan to launch a massive, heavily-publicized campaign to find the remaining SS units hiding in the jungle and destroy them."

Lack of interest in Africa, the collapse of the Reich's economy, and more ample and fertile land to be found in Europe left little reason to invest into East Africa. However, many traces of German rule can still be found lingering in each and every corner of the old colony. Roadsigns and rail line markers are written almost exclusively in German, many thousands of white Nazi settlers live in cities and towns dotting the coast, and some old German infrastructure still remains intact. In order to erase these traces of Nazi taint, the signs will be rewritten in both the local language and English; the German infrastructure base will be torn down or repurposed; and the Nazi settlers will be investigated. In their place, American companies and industrial conglomerates will be invited in once more to fill the economic hole left by the tumor of Nazism."

While most of them are low-ranking officials and their families, they still participated in and allowed vicious crimes against humanity to go on. In addition, their continued presence in East Africa has drawn much ire and caused quite a bit of friction with the natives. Thus, as they are partially criminal and detrimental to the stability of the Interim Government, General Westmoreland and the military staff have elected to deport the Germans.

The call is especially loud amongst the Africans, who, after years of desolation at the hands of these men, wish to see them get their just dues. To improve relations with the native Africans, as well as appease the doves back home, Westmoreland has decided not to sit upon the drumhead and outright sentence the remaining war criminals to death. Rather, the Nazis of the East African regime will be put on trial for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other charges.

As much as the Germans of Hüttig's regime were brutal war criminals, they were unusually efficient in organizing and running the vast, disparate territories of East Africa. Now that these low-level bureaucrats and administrators have been imprisoned, executed, or deported, there are now many holes in the administrative goings-on of the Interim Government. To remedy this issue, non-essential OFN officers of rank captain or higher will be officially assigned administrative duties for the betterment of the Interim Government.

Now, however, with the government's rule firmly established, Westmoreland and the general staff believe the time has come to begin the long process of transitioning to a civilian government. While several practical options present themselves, General Westmoreland believes that a Western-friendly liberal democracy would be the easiest and best option for all parties involved.

During the days of Hüttig's regime, warlords popped up too fast for even his brutal SS regiments to crack down on them. In addition, the Nazis... methods had a way of radicalizing and riling up the people to support these warlords. With the support of small villages and entire swathes of countryside to hide in, they can wage an endless war against whatever powers they believe has it out for them.

It will remain an issue for at least a few years, at best. Thus, it becomes necessary to adopt more long term strategies in dealing with it. For this task, Westmoreland and his staff favor the age-old strategy of pure, unadulterated attrition. Hit the warlords fast, frequently, and where it hurts. Bombing runs on supply depots, securing sources of food and water, and annihilating any military targets that dare to expose themselves. In a few months, when most of the warlords are starving, perhaps they'll reconsider their life choices, and make sure the few they have left are more thought through."

These groups, mainly consisting of revolutionary socialists, have expressed interest in peace, cooperation, and compromise with the OFN Interim Government. As there is no good reason not to, Westmoreland and officials from the government will meet with these amiable groups to pursue potential alliances.

In the current East African situation, that means American blood; blood that will no doubt draw ire from back home. To avoid this problem somewhat, General Westmoreland has proposed a plan: hiring native East African tribesmen and recruiting them into ragtag militia groups to fight the remaining Nazis and warlords. These natives bear no great love for either of the latter groups, as they have been responsible for the destruction and poverty now seen across much of the countryside. While these native militias would be somewhat poorly equipped, trained, and disciplined, they could open up a massive manpower pool that will be necessary in restoring law and order to a region utterly bereft of either."

They can hold their own against a small scale raid or two, but as soon as a warlord takes notice of them and their positions, they may as well be throwing rocks for all the good it will do them. They are deeply motivated and eager to fight, they just aren't that good at it. To remedy this problem, Westmoreland and the general staff will begin training regimens for these newly-created units of militia. At the moment, they may be disorganized, undisciplined, and under-supplied, with a bit of assistance from American drill sergeants, they might just be whipped into a fighting force capable of pushing back the warlords."

There are too many places to hide, too many unmarked paths to travel, and too much terrain to cover. However, warlords often raid villages around their headquarters for supplies, making it rather easy to find their hiding holes in the jungle. While we often lack the troops to take these bases in a ground assault, they can still be weakened or destroyed through superior firepower. By organizing bombing raids on known warlord strongholds, we can deal a serious blow to their ability to collect supplies and fight effectively without putting any of our precious manpower at risk. Bombings won't be enough to bury the warlords on their own, but they will be another nail in the coffin."

Since the fall of the Hüttig regime, there has been an uneasy lull in the fighting, as warlords reevaluate their positions and tactics regarding the new OFN forces, and the OFN reinforced their positions and capabilities across the vast territories of East Africa. Now, however, the OFN is ready to bring down the nuisance of the warlords. We have enough men, we have enough supplies, and we have enough will to finally begin to crush this problem before it gets any worse. American troops and local militias will now begin the long, arduous fight of pushing the warlords back, rather than just slowing them down. With American brawn and African blood, our list of enemies stands to get much shorter."

If the efforts of the Interim Government in establishing pro-OFN governments are to be successful, it needs to act proactively in fighting Anti-American groups. Local and regional powers of dubious loyalty will be investigated and policed by American forces. At the first signs of disloyalty, they will be disbanded or destroyed.

By doing the same, the OFN Interim Government could achieve something similar. Of course, given their prior cooperation with the Hüttig regime, the move will be controversial, so Westmoreland will arrange suitable punishment for the harshest of collaborators. Those only tangentially complicit with Nazi crimes, however, will be free to go.

With overwhelming evidence against many of them, the punishment for most will be death by hanging or by firing squad. The rest will receive prison time accordingly.\n\nThose warlords and rebel leaders still not in government custody, with few forces left under their command, are basically irrelevant. Still, they are criminals and agitators and must be treated as such.

The transition from a military government to a civilian one will not be simple or easy, however, and it will require a great deal of effort on the part of everyone involved. General Westmoreland will call hundreds of leaders from American-friendly regions and movements, as well as dozens of high-ranking OFN officers, to Quelimane.

Such is the case with East Africa, where, in spite of heavy American influence over the past few years, is definitely lacking in its desire for liberal democracy. A very large portion of the population believe in socialism of a kind, which will inevitably form part of the backbone of whatever new nation or nations East Africa becomes. Thus, General Westmoreland will begin to negotiate with socialist territories and rebel groups, giving many of them much more power in native affairs and government.

While a lot of this research and knowledge went back to Germany, the flow of information stopped when Hitler did. The Kommissariat of East Africa had some of the most advanced chemical tech on Earth before it and its technology fell into the hands of the OFN. By digging through all the research they had collected over the years, the OFN could gain very valuable insights into German combat and medical capabilities, as well as gaining and edge on them in terms of chemical weaponry.

We may claim to be above the use of such weaponry, but the fear of their use by the Germans, or more likely, the Japanese, drives the American government to express interest in their development. As such, the nerve agent VX, discovered by the Hüttig regime, has come to General Westmoreland's attention. It is extremely fast acting and far more potent than similar chemicals like sarin, taking less than ten milligrams to kill a man. It first came to the attention of American spies operating in England during the 1950's, and now, more than a decade later, we can not only develop countermeasures for it, but we can manufacture it."

Now, they have set their sights on Tanganyika, one of the most populous and important provinces in the entire region. With much more concentrated and organized forces, the warlords are causing absolute mayhem. The American garrisons aren't strong enough to mount an effective defense of every remote town, and the native militias and socialist allies are either deserting or retreating in the face of this onslaught.\n\nGeneral Westmoreland knows that if this situation is allowed to continue, it could spiral out of control, possibly leading to the complete destruction of the OFN presence here.

 OFN_MZB.1.desc:0 "The situation in East Africa is multifaceted and complex, but in summary there are two regions in the country. The first is the coastal region, which was well-developed by the Germans and serves as a convenient port of call for our vessels and can be held against attacks from the interior. This is where the majority of East Africa's industry is located, well-secured against attacks and sabotage, and we can use their same defenses to keep it secured for the United States.\n\nThe other region of note is the interior, a wilderness of jungle where very little has changed under our occupation. It is occupied primarily by rebels who originally sought to avoid the depredations of the Nazis, but do not seem interested in cooperating with the United States government either. The situation in the interior will likely continue to cause problems throughout the course of our mission.\n\nAs for the available resources, the primary one of note is the chemical industry that Hüttig was building up before his overthrow and disappearance. It is currently geared to the production of chemical weapons, which could be retooled and retasked to the benefit to OFN investors from the chemical industry, or used to bolster the military capabilities of the OFN.\n\nIn conclusion, while the occupation is likely to be short, we can provide significant boons to American business while we figure out a way to bring relative stability to the region."

Westmoreland was not one to be easily intimidated, however. \"Welcome, gentlemen, to East Africa. I'm sure you're all aware why I asked you all to meet with me, because there's really only one good reason: I'm offering to make the chemical industry of East Africa available for the use of Dow Chemical.\"\n\nA few murmurs came from the representatives, but most regarded this with quiet interest. \"General Westmoreland, if I may?\" One of them asked. At Westmoreland's nod, the man continued. \"How much do you expect to charge us for the use of this industry? Surely you aren't doing this out of the kindness of your heart.\"\n\nThat got a smile from Westmoreland. \"This is my favorite part! We aren't charging you any money; there's no initial investment necessary on your part.\" After pausing for a moment, Westmoreland continued. \"But!

This would be a temporary measure, of course; the Mandate wouldn't last forever after all.

Greeting him was the sight of an indeterminable number of people who looked like the essence of death.

Presiding over the court was U.S. Army General William R. Peers, who had ensured that the trials would be held in total secrecy so as to prevent a diplomatic crisis with the Reich. Turning to the accused, he continued. \"Mr Hössler, please rise to hear the charges.\"\n\nHössler did so, and the clerk began reading off his crimes. \"Mr. Hössler, you are charged that throughout the course of the South African conflict, you committed war crimes and crimes against the African people.\" Looking directly at Hössler himself, the clerk said the next part slowly. \"How do you plead?\"\n\nRather than fear, or regret, or anything of the sort, the only emotion that SS-Obersturmbannführer Franz Hössler showed was delight. \"Guilty, not guilty, what does it matter in this court of yours?\" He replied, an amused grin across his face. \"Since you asked, though, I am guilty! I have overseen the extermination of countless mongrels and subhumans, and were I a free man, I would gladly see to that of countless more. Yes, I am guilty, and I could not be more proud of it, you filthy dogs!\"\n\nAs General Peers only shook his head in response, military police restrained Hössler for his remarks. \"So be it. Franz Hössler, you are hereby sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for your crimes. May God grant you mercy one day, because you'll never find it again on Earth.\" As the MPs dragged Hössler out of the courtroom, he looked up at Peers with utter contempt.

Looking it over, he felt fairly satisfied with the result. Most, like Hössler, had been proud of their genocidal work, monsters without even the pretense of regret. Others had at least seemed to be apologetic, but which were faking it, Peers never could tell. Either way, they needed to pay to the fullest for what they had done, and from now on they would, spending the rest of their days in secret prison cells and forced to give the United States information about the SS to lessen their suffering in the slightest. It was the least they deserved.\n\nNevertheless, the thought that the public might learn about the trials, and thereby the Reich, worried Peers. He had prohibited civilians from attending and sworn all officers present to secrecy, yet doubt still plagued his mind. There might be much intelligence to be gained and propaganda to be made from this, but he had to wonder if that outweighed the potential diplomatic crisis that might come about if the source were ever discovered. There was no such thing as winning a nuclear war.\n\nPutting the summary inside of a box labeled 'Top Secret', he swiftly closed and locked it to hinder prying eyes. \"It's all set, come on in.\" He commanded, and the door to his office swung open to reveal a young officer who served as his aide, quickly giving him a crisp salute. \"I want you to take this directly to the Pentagon. There's a flight ready for you, take it and no matter what don't take your eyes off this box. If you lose it, or open it, there will be severe consequences for you. Am I clear?\" At the young man's yes, sir, Peers handed the locked box over to him and watched as he carried it off into the distance, out of sight. Then, he leaned back in his chair and sighed. There was no easy cure for his concerns, but now it was out of his hands and he had done what he could to serve his country and all of humanity. If nothing else, he could be proud of that."
