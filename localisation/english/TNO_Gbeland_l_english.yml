 GBE_idea_ghosts_republic_dahomey: "Ghosts of Dahomey"
 GBE_idea_ghosts_republic_dahomey_desc: "According to the official line of the new government, the recent coup came from a demand for change from the people, which Hachème and his clique dutifully carried out. Similarly, the old Republic of Dahomey was little more than a corrupt hole, serving the rich aristocrats rather than the citizens who struggled to hash out a living under the German bombs. Take a trip into the streets of Lome, however, and one finds that public sentiment generally swings far away from what Hachème spouts.\n\nYes, they concede, the Republic had its troubles, but at least there was a dream of stability and prosperity in the future. At the very least, the systems were fair, unlike today's Gbe-friendly government. Such discontent must be treated quickly by Hachème's regime, for a nation with widespread nostalgia for the previous government is a nation that will go back as soon as they can."
 GBE_idea_militia_based_army: "Militia Based Army"
 GBE_idea_militia_based_army_desc: "In war, anything and everything must be used to win. Often, glaring problems are pushed off into the future for short term solutions, as each faction battles to survive and emerge victorious from the bloody melee. Such a Faustian deal was struck by Babaginda in the early days of the war, when the question of the militias came to an ugly head. With the choice between either letting local militias, controlled by largely autonomous generals and administrators, lead the war effort, or instead attempt to reform his forces into a cohesive army in the middle of a war, Hachème made the reasonable choice of letting things be for the time- but now, with the war past, the chickens have come home to roost.\n\nFactionalism and corruption rear their ugly heads among the generals and their forces, as a coalition without an enemy to fight begins to fracture and split. If nothing is done, Gbeland will have an armed force that looks less like an army and more like a mob. Reforms, as painful as they will be, must be taken if the nation wishes to defend itself once more."

 POLITICS_IBRAHIM_BABANGIDA_DESC: "There are a few important things to know about Ibrahim Babaginda. He is the chosen leader of the Gbe, except he isn't. He holds the power in Gbeland, which he doesn't. Finally, he is not in over his head, which he is.\n\nBorn in the middle of the Second World War, Babaginda was but a toddler when the French packed up and left. He grew up in the days of the Republic of Dahomey, a somewhat stable and functioning democracy which he was proud to be part of. However, as time went on, and the Republic continued to turn a blind eye to the increasingly furious Gbe people, the situation continued to deteriorate. As Babaginda joined the ranks of the generals, the frustrations boiled over into a bloodless military coup, expected to be led by the esteemed general Christophe Soglo. However, Soglo, along with multiple other senior generals, refused the position, leaving the President's seat open and dividing the army into two cliques- one for the coup and one against it. With nobody stepping up to the seat, the pro-coup clique nominated Babaginda to the seat which he reluctantly accepted, becoming President at the mere age of 20 in 1961. He would soon come to regret that choice.\n\nMuch adversity pushes the newfound Gbeland to the brink of destruction. The anti-coup clique, led by the renowned and popular Soglo, remains a major threat to Babaginda's controversial regime. Memories of Dahomey persist in the minds of the people outside of the Gbe, who do not take kindly to being second class to the Gbe. Babaginda's influence in the military is still rather weak, especially in comparison to Soglo's. Above it all, the Germans continue their constant and regular bombings, a regular grim reaper of the people and the economy. It seems that Gbeland may be doomed to an early death.\n\nHowever, despite this, nobody can deny the fire behind Babaginda's eyes. He is the president now, and he will do everything to remain the President of Gbeland as long as he breathes, or die trying."
