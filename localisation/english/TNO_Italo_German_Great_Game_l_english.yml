GG_startup.2.t:0 "The Great Bulgarian Game"
GG_startup.2.desc:0 "Bulgaria, since the closing days of the Second World War, has been closely linked to Germany and her Pakt. This wasn't an issue for Bulgaria, and was even profitable for the two for nearly a decade. The great market crash of the 50s changed everything, however.\n\nSo closely tied to the German economy, it was only natural that the Bulgarian markets followed suit. Bulgaria very nearly left the Pakt; the Germans, exerting the rest of their influence they had in the region, managed to threaten, bribe, and call in enough favors to pack the Bulgarian administration with pro-German ministers. To keep the government under close watch, the Germans shortly after deployed a 'garrison' to Sofia itself to help 'keep the peace during the turmoil.' Ten years later, and one still sees German boots patrolling the capitol.\n\nTimes are perhaps changing, however. The Bulgarian government is perhaps ripe to be overthrown. Prime Minister Gabrovski, well known to be in German hands, recently died in a car accident. Rumor surrounds his death, but whether he was assassinated or truly did die in a tragic accident means nothing. His death has given the underground Fatherland Front the hope they needed to begin acting against pro-German elements in the country. As Italian influences attempt to snake their way into the country, the Reich has begun to crack down on what they see as dissident activity. Only time will tell what will result from the two's meddling in Bulgaria."
GG_startup.2.a:0 "And so, the Great Game begins!"

GG_startup.3.t:0 "The Great Hungarian Game"
GG_startup.3.desc:0 "For years now, Hungary has been an unwilling participant in Germany's sphere of influence, both military and economically.\n\nTimes are perhaps changing, however. Although both countries share leadership that leans to the right of the political spectrum, that is where the similarities end. Hungarian sentiment towards the Germans is almost non-existent at this point. Any goodwill Germany still had with the small country ended when it stood by as Hungary's neighbors tore her apart in her moment of weakness following the market crash of the 50s. It is hardly surprising then that Hungary is keeping its options open as the Reich recovers from its disastrous civil war.\n\nThe Italians, perhaps sensing a prime opportunity to undermine the Germans, have begun to reopen diplomatic channels, with there being talks of possible Italian investments into the economy and a mutual defensive pact. Not to be outdone, the Germans are likewise now taking special interests into their neighbor and historic ally.\n\nIt seems the two are now in direct competition with each other once again. And the prize of such a high stakes game?"
GG_startup.3.a:0 "For such a Great Game? Hungary, of course!"

GG_startup.4.t:0 "The Great Romanian Game"
GG_startup.4.desc:0 "The domestic situation in Romania is heating up. More or less isolated from any of the great powers of the world since the end of the Second World War, Romania has kept itself clear from German and Italian influences for over two decades. Though the Great Market Crash did hurt the Romanian economy, the government used the situation to their advantage and managed to claw back all of their lost possessions from Hungary. King Mihai I even managed to claw his way into the top echelon of government, where he promptly banned the fanatical Iron Guard from participating in government. Although this move gave him de facto political control over the country, the reality of the situation is that Romania is a deeply divided state. A plethora of far right groups operate in secrecy, biding their time and growing their roots as rogue Iron Guard partisans terrorize the countryside and any non-Romanians.\n\nThe situation has recently worsened as another surge of terrorist activity racks that nation. This time, however, the chaos has caught the attention of both Italy and Germany, who both sense that perhaps now is the time to expand their influence to the neutral country. For once, it is perhaps the Italians who have the advantage. King Mihai and his immediate cabinet, while cordial to the Reich, refuse to deepen ties with a regime that is so akin to the Iron Guard. Italian investors and military missions will likely see a lot of success in the coming days. That isn't to say the Germans have nothing to work with; however. Rumors are starting to circulate that the Nazis are supporting the Iron Guard and the other far right underground parties in the state. For better or worse, Romania is now the next unwilling participant in the Great Game."
GG_startup.4.a:0 "Both sides are moving their pieces for a new Game."

GG_startup.5.t:0 "The Great French Game"
GG_startup.5.desc:0 "It isn't a stretch to say that France is a shell of its former self. Ravaged and beat after the Second World War, it had no choice but to aquisate to the demands of the Reich and Italian Empire. Stripped of their colonies and a vast portion of their eastern border, they were then forced into bondage, subject to the whims of Germany.\n\nThis changed with the outbreak of the German Civil War. With their overlord embroiled in war, France was finally free to choose her destiny for the first time in over two decades. The celebration was short lived; Himmler's Burgundy quickly invaded and now occupies nearly half of the entire country. France is now isolated, and in the market for a new ally.\n\nAlthough many Frenchmen are loath to rejoin the Pakt, the Germans likely are the best bet if France wants its lands back. The SS and Burgundy is no friend to the Reich, and although they would be once again aligned with their old overlords, the dynamic would certainly be different. However, the Italians are also making a bid to win the French over. Offers of economic prosperity, protection, and an ally that isn't Germanic is certainly tempting, though that isn't to say that the French have forgotten that the Italians control large portions of their past empire.\n\nIt isn't certain who the French will side with, but both Germany and Italy seem determined to shepherd them into their respective spheres. A new Game in France is about to begin."
GG_startup.5.a:0 "Yet another round begins!"

GG_startup.6.t:0 "The Great Serbian Game"
GG_startup.6.desc:0 "Many around the world wouldn't know it, but technically, Serbia is an independent country. In actuality, it is little more than a German led collaboration state; its certainly ran like one.\n\nAlthough relatively peaceful after the Second World War, the small state would see a huge influx of refugees enter its borders. Italian indifference to the plight of Serbians in Albania and other Italian held regions in the Balkans ment that Serbia is one of the few places left that welcomes its own people, and even there they face hardships. The country, not ready to face such massive numbers of migrants and immigrants now has to deal with massive unemployment, poverty, and literal cities of tents for refugees who have nowhere else to go. To make matters worse, the situation is about to boil over.\n\nWith more and more refugees entering the country by the day, the conditions in the many refugee camps are becoming unsustainable. The Italian government, ever 'generous,' is offering a large amount of humanitarian aid to assist the Serbian people, although this doesn't change the fact that the Italians are the largest contributor to the problem in the first place, something the government conveniently ignores. On the other side of the fence, the Germans are implementing their own work programs and sending economic assistance, while both sides try to play the Serbians against each other in an underground political battle. It isn't clear exactly who has an advantage or who the Serbians hate more, but the results will be nothing short of entertaining, if nothing else."
GG_startup.6.a:0 "The Serbians are just more pawns in the Game."
