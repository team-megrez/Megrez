The Americans will no doubt back the opposition, who has risen up in armed conflict to try to oust Machel and install their own dictator in its place, so it falls to us to protect the Machel regime and our interests in not only Mozambique, but all of Africa as well by extension, blunting the tip of the Yankee sphere in Africa in the process.\n\nDevastation is: [?ZZZ.gazaland_devastation]\n\nMin is: [?ZZZ.gazaland_devastation_exponential_min]\n\nMax is: [?ZZZ.gazaland_devastation_exponential_max]\nEvery 3 weeks devestation will increase by a number between the min and the max.

Having endured decades of occupation from the Japanese invaders, the Malayan people have seen the government alternate between collaborators and rebels from time and time again, and has fought a relentless guerilla campaign against the Japanese occupiers.\n\nThe 25th Army, which are stationed there by the Japanese, has launched a final desperate offensive in the hopes of destroying rebel presence in the region once and for all. This has led the rebels to contact us in search for aid to defeat the Japanese.\n\nDespite our clear ideological differences, the opportunity that Malaya provides is immeasurable. We are finally able to strike them where it hurts, and if the stars align, We will tear down the Crested Wave piece by piece, and we will watch as their glorious Sphere crumble before our eyes."

################### Madagascar
USA_madagascar_conflict:0 "When Emil Maurice, longtime Reichskommissar of German Madagascar approached us with an offer to defect, it was a chance we could not pass up. Admiral Moorer of the Indian Ocean Command quickly spearheaded the initiative to extract Maurice from his own crumbling fiefdom while laying the groundwork for the OFN presence to come on the island.\n\nOf course there was bound to be resistance. A faction of the garrison led by Field Marshal Erhard Milch, a known confidant of Reich Marshal Hermann Göring, has been ignoring Maurice's orders for some time now from their positions in the west of the island. Further complicating things is the group of natives led by Gabriel Ramanantsoa who have taken the opportunity to rebel in the north. While we had hoped to avoid violent confrontation with them, peaceful coexistence has proven impossible as they have refused to deal with us given our admittance of several members of the former administration into our United Coalition Government. We must therefore struggle against the German hardliners and native rebels both if we wish to establish a free Malagasy."
GER_madagascar_conflict:0 "All Hell has broken loose in Reichskommissariat Madagaskar with the traitor Emil Maurice fled and the natives in open revolt. Now only Milch and those loyal to him and the Reich remain to fend off the encroaching degeneracy. The Americans and Japanese have already begun to meddle in the affair, propping up the challenges to our control.\n\nThe OFN have established a proxy administration full of their own men and remnants of Maurice's administration. It seems the rot coming from the head infected the whole body. Meanwhile in the north of the island our onetime ally Japan is sponsoring natives led by the former collaborator Gabriel Ramanantsoa against both our garrison and the self-proclaimed OFN administration. We cannot allow Madagaskar to be the weak link that spoils our whole chain; we must rally our resources and restore order to the island!"
JAP_madagascar_conflict:0 "The collapse of the German Reich's only Indian Ocean holding came as a complete surprise - the planned defection of Reichskommissar Emil Maurice to the OFN had not even been known to us until our agents in the Tokumusoukan discovered that he had already vanished. Surprise or no though, this is an opportunity we can ill afford to waste. The Indian Ocean is our rightful domain and the Germans have overstayed their welcome. The Americans too are over stepping in their blatant attempt to claim the island for their own hegemony.\n\nIt falls on us to sweep the island clear of unwanted foreign influences. Luckily a group of natives under Gabriel Ramanantsao have risen up in the north of the island to combat both the remaining garrison and the OFN puppets. While they wish to maintain their independence, we can appeal to them as friends of imperialized peoples of the world. We may not be able to project direct control in this fashion but we can gain an ally in close proximity to Africa while denying our rivals the eastward launching pad that they might use against us."

  ##Japan
  JAP_PHI_PW_1_desc:0 "The Philippine insurgency is perhaps the longest-enduring conflict the IJA has ever had the dishonor of quelling, matched perhaps only by that in Malaya. A posting in the islands often spells the death knell of every glory-hound and careerist, for their jungles promise only malaria and a .50-caliber cure. Further hampering any lasting success are the budget cuts of ministries past, dwindling the once-formidable 14th Army's numbers into a glorified garrison - a trend only recently stymied by the damnable rebels' resurgence.\n\nNevertheless, the archipelago's importance is rarely overstated. For the Pearl of the Orient secures not just our sea lanes to Indonesia but also our grand bulwark against the American leviathan. A loss now will leave our lands and seas exposed once more to Western intrusion; Heavens know what will happen from there.\n\nThankless and bloody our job may be, but it is necessary.

Nevertheless, Japan's parting shot is as direct as it is profuse with irony: that the Empire would so easily surrender is laughable at best, and a lethal jape at worst. The real test begins soon, at the rare moment in a man's life where history repeats and legends are retold.\n\nSo rally the men, raise the palisades, man the guns - but above all, never lose hope.

  JAP_PHI_reconstruction_desc:0 "The failure of the Balintawak Blitz has brought us ever further into solidifying our position as the sole master of all of Asia. Though their rebellions have collapsed, the damage that they inflicted is here to stay, and is costing the Filipino government a fortune to clean up, which if they're not careful, could spell economic and societal disaster within the country.\n\nThus, we have elected that we will bring aid for our Filipino brothers in many shapes and forms, be it money, medical equipment, construction, or even weapons to clean up any remaining resistance fighters.\n\nHowever, we have been warned that the tension in the islands are very palpable, and that a failed reconstruction campaign may warrant §Runforeseen consequences§!. We must be weary."
  
  USA_USFIP_Fertig_reconstruction_desc:0 "Although the parties have died down and the beer taps have finally run dry, the Filipino people must still contend with the pains of a nation exhausted both in land and spirit. American aid in easing this process goes without saying.\n\nOur analysts estimate that we have no more than six months of leeway to fix the war's worst damages before public sentiment compels a withdrawal. By then authority should be restored to an elected civilian government, whether it is of Carlos P. Romulo's Commonwealth exiles or Carlos P. Garcia's "new Filipinos."\n\nNote that Mr. Romulo has staked his legitimacy on us delivering not merely reconstruction, but a timely, well-managed one at that. Should we exceed the six-month deadline, Mr. Garcia will likely succeed the late Sergio Osmeña, Sr. as President and establish a government less open to our suggestions than the "Filipino Franklin's.""
  USA_UPH_OFN_Mandate_reconstruction_desc:0 "With the general breakdown of civilian government in the Philippine Islands, Congress has authorized the Philippine Department to enforce martial law within the former Commonwealth's jurisdiction until order is fully restored and the bare minimum of economic activities may resume. General Beach pledged that martial law will last for no more than six months, after which the Mandate authorities will assume all government functions.\n\nFor the country today, insofar as it may still be one, is a hollow shell of what it was before the Blitz. Villages lay empty, the hollow wrecks of cities wail, and what few parcels of farmland that haven't been bombed, burned, or defoiled have been plucked of all they're worth by the bandits that rule the interior. Hope has fled for fairer climes; much as it pains us to say, the Filipino people will have to do without it for quite some time."
  USA_SPH_Coalition_reconstruction_desc:0 "In response to the 14th Army invasion, the USFIP and the Communist insurgency brokered an agreement which elevated their non-agression pact during the Blitz into a full-fledged alliance. Among its stipulations was a binding pledge to organize a post-war government composed of appointees from the Communist Party of the Philippines, the military and civilian halves of the USFIP, and miscellaneous groups opposed to the former KALIBAPI. Thus, the so-termed United Filipino Front evolved into the Coalition Government following the Evacuation.\n\nActing President Lorenzo Tañada's popularity can only preserve its precarious balance for so long before either Ramon Magsaysay's militarists or Luis Taruc's Communists grow too dissatisfied with their current arrangement. What happens in either case is anyone's guess, but it certainly won't be good for the country - or for us, after all we'd sunk into prying it off Japan."

While the country shed the shackles from the Japanese Sphere, the truth is, it stands alone surrounded by agressive countries that see them as traitors, and her only allies being the Indian and the Australians, and who knows what holds for them in the future. The war is over, but the real battle to rebuild the country from years of warfare has begin; one battle that, thankfully, is much easier on our burdens. Investors and Money are much more pliable to movement than guns and tanks."

To this end, the Greater East Asian Ministry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have proposed the Southern Sphere Reconstruction and Stabilisation Initiative - a plan to grease the wheels of the full economic potential of the region. From the tin mines of Malaya to the rubber plantations of North Borneo, our grip on the Sphere will be reforged, and our political hegemony in the region will be secured."

### Mengjiang Conflict 

JAP_mengjiang_conflict_desc:0 "Long after its destruction in the World War, the ghosts of the Soviet Union still haunt us.\n\nIn the far northwestern reach of our sphere of influence, a war yet rages. A faithful ally of Japan, Prince Demchugdongrub of Mengjiang, finds himself embroiled in a bitter conflict with a rebellion on his northern frontier. The so-called "Mongolian People's Front" is a puppet organization controlled by an exiled Red Army clique, and if they are allowed to succeed in their aims, it could start a chain destabilization of the entire Sphere. For obvious reasons, this cannot be allowed.\n\nHowever, we have faith in the Prince and his soldiers to be able to handle the situation, and for all the better. It is best that local troops handle what is ultimately a local crisis, but that does not mean we cannot send some aid and support their way in the form of guns, advice, and other equipment. With low-grade support like this, we can hopefully prevent the situation from spiralling so badly that it'd require a direct intervention.\n\nAll the same, we will do what we must."

### Iranian Civil War

JAP_ircw_category_desc:0 "Once one of the few allies belonging to Germany in the Middle East, Iran has recently imploded into civil war following the death of its Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, a largely unpopular figure following his overthrowing of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and establishment of his pro-German regime. As the instability of the region has been threatening to boil over since the beginning of the Oil Crisis, it seems only natural that with the death of its leader, the partisans of Iran have made their move for power.\n\nAmong these rebels moving against the government of Iran are the Democratic Republic of Iran, led by Karim Sanjabi, the Socialist Federation of Iran under Iraj Eskanderi, and the Baluchi Liberation Front, an independence movement in the south of the nation led by Sher Mohammed Marri, among others. Of course, there is also the remnants of the pro-German government holed out of the north of the nation.\n\nAs fresh arms flow into the region, and the anti-German alliance already shows cracks, it would seem as though it's in the best interest of the world powers to send aid the way of their preferred candidates."

### SAF War - Aftermath

TNO_SAF_Aftermath_desc_USA:0 "We have won a great victory for democracy in South Africa, but our work is far from finished. While the German army is defeated, remnants of their forces still fight on. In addition, many local warlords have established their own forces, and would like nothing better than expel us from their lands. Victory in Africa means nothing if we cannot stabilize the continent.\n\nSome of our officers have suggested continuing our strategy of attrition, using overwhelming firepower and superior tactics to eliminate as many rebels that we can while minimizing our own losses. However, diplomatic officials have suggested using a softer touch to win over the natives, which they claim will stabilize the continent better in the long term. Whichever approach we take, the public demands that our young men return home soon, and leave a stable continent behind. If we fail to satisfy the public, we will surely suffer at the polls."

America will not stand by while slavery is reimposed upon Africans - defeat is not an option!"
JAP_mano_campaign_desc: "Our cohorts in anti-imperialism, the Pan-African Liberation Front, has excelled thus far in West Africa; their defeat of the 'Free' French, even backed by the OFN, proved the righteousness of our cause. Western avarice is no match for the armed wrath of the oppressed. Now, with the Oil Crisis raging, and the PALF relatively unaffected, they have seized the opportunity and struck at the last bastions of imperialism: Sierra Leone and Liberia.\n\nBoth ourselves and the OFN are impacted by the Oil Crisis, but the Americans have still thrown what they can spare into the conflict. If the PALF fais now, West Africa will continue to be threatened by the colonialist boot - we cannot permit that. One last effort to dislodge the imperialists, and the region will be freed at last... and firmly within our sphere."

### French Civil War ###

USA_ffr_reclamation_desc: "In 1776, the French aided the USA in the fight against tyranny - now, it's time to return the favor. The Free French have reached the next step in their campaign to reclaim their homeland from the Nazis - and we will aid them in any way we can.\n\nWe've gotten this far - France's military victories in West Africa would have been impossible without our aid - and now we must take them over the finish line. The French are excited - and rightfully so- but we must ensure that their actions can back up their words."
USA_french_civil_war_desc: "Although France did not take sides in the American Civil War, we will take a side in theirs: we will send men, guns, and other types of aid to the Free French. We will help them reclaim their homeland - and thus return to the world stage as a staunch ally of the OFN. We've gotten this far - France's military victories in West Africa would have been impossible without our aid - and now we must take them over the finish line. The French are excited - and rightfully so - but we must ensure that their actions can back up their words."
USA_FFR_Reclamation_Modifier: "Involvement in §WFrench Reclamation§!"

GER_ffr_reclamation_desc: "For decades now, the inability of the legitimate French Government to curtail the influence of the French Resistance has been a blight on Germany's attempts to maintain its influence over western europe, countless amounts of economic and military aid have born little results, now, most insultingly, they have allowed an old ghost of our conquest of the perfidious French Republic to come back to haunt us.\n\nThe reemergence of our enemy on French soil is an insult to the Aryan Race, forsooth, the old rivalry shall henceforth be rekindled again."
GER_french_civil_war_desc: "The political instability of the French State gave rise into a full blown civil war. While this result is not surprising given the signs from the last 10 years, having so much chaos this close to the Rhine - our natural defense line - is deleterious to the stability of the Reich.\n\nAdding insult to injury, reliable intel from the Mediterranean coast of France tells us of movements of troops bearing a tricolor with the Cross of Lothringen, the symbol of the accursed gaullists. We must squash and then quickly remove them from public light."

IBR_ffr_reclamation_desc: "We have promised aid to the French. They have paid their side of the bargain and it is now our turn to pay our fair share. From Bilbao to Barcelona we are ready to cross the border and go all in on backing the Free French. Our troops will begin pouring across the border into France as we engage in combat in continental Europe for the first time since the civil war.\n\nIf all goes to plan, we will have a stable ally between us and the German menace to our east. Such an opportunity would be great to give the Germans a taste of their own medicine and scare them with a hostile state on their borders for decades to come."

By supporting the Second Patriotic Army, our proud, albeit odd, National Socialist brothers, against the so-called legitimate government, the fascist New Granadans, and the socialists in the Colombian Revolutionary Union, we can bring a piece of Latin America into the National Socialist fold- right near the United States. It is important that we do not squander this opportunity."

Recent developments in Colombia have colluded to provide us a window into involving ourselves in the war. Already, there have been talks with our chosen side's leadership to begin arranging steady lines of communication. We have pledged or are preparing to pledge diplomatic, logistic, humanitarian and military support. Now it is only a specifics before we are fully involved in the conflict, with our options for just how we go about backing a side laid out before us.

The bloody skirmishes along the border have relatively ceased. Although casualties were high, our allies prevailed and managed to overpower the enemy lines in a series of increasingly one sided battles. With the enemy's main force broken, Iberian volunteers and local troops set to work rooting out partisans and establishing garrisons to occupy the towns in the area. Although partisans remain an issue, it is negligible enough that we can say for sure that our side has won out in the region.\n\nThat being said, the conflict continues to escalate still, the enemy is rearming, and the partisans in the area will not give up so easily. Soon we will have to take action to hold on to our tenuous advantage in Colombia."

The enemy was able to overpower both our allies and our own volunteers, exacting heavier and heavier casualties until morale and supply forced us out of the area. Although a significant partisan presence has remained behind to cause trouble for the foe, who have managed to establish garrisons in there, their presence is not enough to truly dispute enemy control. We must face the fact that the enemy has won this fight and now fully occupies the border territories.\n\nThe situation continues to escalate regardless. We are at a significant disadvantage, but we should not let that stop us from preparing for a more intense conflict. With this in mind, we should be ready to take action decisively and effectively if or when the time comes."
IBR_colombia.4.a: "This can only get worse."

BRA_colombia.1.desc: "It was already a long and tumultuous day for [BRA.GetLeader], after all, being the leader of Brazil was no easy task. But it seemed that he must now shift his worries outside the land of 'order and progress.' Just as he entered his office in the Planalto, he was met with generals from all over the country, from the Amazonian jungle to the Riograndense pampas. On his table, there were at least ten different maps of Colombia, all of which seemed the same but showcased different details, even if minor.\n\n"Good evening Mr President, I hope your day was a tranquil one. Please, have a seat." said one of the generals as they pulled a chair for [BRA.GetLeader]. "Let's get on with this already, shall we?"\n\n"As you may know from the news, the illusion of Colombia's peace is about to come to an end. Capitão Salcedo's forces have been engaged in heavy combat with the Central Government for the last few days, and it's only going to get worse from each bullet that leaves their guns." - explained the general - "Once the civil war goes into full force, it's inevitable that it's going to affect the bordering regions in some way or another. Therefore it's crucial that we make sure the victors in this war are willing to be our allies."\n\n"I must recommend that we support the anti-fascists of the URC, since they-"\n\n"Those wannabe Varguists? Give me a break!" - One general yelled in protest - "We shouldn't be helping out their lot, all they want is the tyranny of the majority and mob rule! If anyone is going to help us, it's the strong, stable government in Bogotá. They've gotten rid of that Francoist bastard and are even holding elections!"\n\n"Have you forgotten what Gaitán meant to this damned continent? He was a socialist, but he created the most stable democracy in the Americas, and now his dream's under attack by the fascist horde. We should be promoting democratic governments around this continent, not supporting more despotic governments like the Argentinians do in Paraguay."\n\nThe general who had protested nodded in assent, then turned to the president with his colleague. "Well, which one is it Mr President?"\n\nAs he held his chin with his hands, [BRA.GetLeader] responded:"

One general exclaimed to the Crow, who couldn't stop cawing.\n\n"So you're telling me our only option are the goddamned Gaitanistas? This war is already lost, then. I am absolutely not approving this. I loved Gaitán like everyone else, but they're fools if they can't see that his followers are just as bad as the damned Varguists!" the Crow continued to caw as the generals tried to explain the same thing over and over. Minutes passed until, eventually, the crow seemed to have run out of energy, one general noticed this and took the opportunity to explain the necessity to support the Revolutionaries.\n\n"I hate those populistic socialists as much as you do, but we must be pragmatic when it comes to who we support in this continent. We don't know how Colombia could end up if we just choose to ignore it. The Americans say that the Revolutionaries hold elections in their territory, that they've maintained civilian rule this whole time in the face of the fascists..."\n\nAfter one cup of water to help his hoarse voice, the Crow chirped: "Right, well. I guess I do prefer having a Colombian Vargas on my doorstep than a Mussolini. You have my authorization, then."\n\n"Thank you, Mr. President" Said one of the generals as they left the room, leaving Lacerda to think for himself.”

Still, we can't deny that we need to resort to such methods to weaken Hüttig's stranglehold over Africa: by arming loyal Germans who still fight for the remnants of Zentralafrika and Südwestafrika, we'll force the madman to overstretch his already-meagre forces, reducing his control over the abomination he calls "state" and strengthening our allies."
