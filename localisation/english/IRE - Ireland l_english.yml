 IRE_jim_larkin_leader_desc: "James Larkin, born in England before moving with his family to Ireland grew up in poverty and became a trade union organiser and formed the Labour Party with James Connolly, most famously participating in the failed Dublin Lockout of 1913. After the failure of the lockout, he moved to America and became a member of the Socialist Party of America. Upon his return to Ireland in 1923 he received a hero's welcome from Irish syndicalists and took control of the Labour Party, hoping to launch a syndicalist rising as in France over disappointments with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The rising was a failure with informers revealing the plans of the ICA rebels beforehand and the Labour Party was banned, leading Larkin to go into hiding with the help of the Commune of France. The Irish Citizen Army suffered dear for their loyalty, with their role in the Easter Rising being erased from the official history and their founder James Connolly's role downplayed."
 IRE_cathal_brugha_leader_desc: "Born Charles William St. John Burgess of mixed Catholic and Protestant heritage, and later changing his name after joining the Gaelic League, Cathal Brugha is a war hero from the Easter Rising and leader of the rump Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He, already being a staunch rival of Collins during the War of Independence, became leader of the democratic opposition, a coalition of democratic parties opposing Collins, although he has increasingly become a figurehead to rally around in his old age as a new generation rises in the Republican movement. He and his party, bolstered in strength by many ex-Labourites following the 1923 ban after Larkin's failed uprising, advocate a social democratic Ireland as per the Democratic Programme of 1919, and a pro-German alignment to oppose Ireland's enemies in Britain and Canada."
 IRE_eamon_de_valera_leader_desc: "Éamon de Valera, born in New York to a Spanish father and Irish mother and taken to Ireland at the age of two, was a commander in the Easter Rising and a political leader during the War of Independence, however ending up slipping into political irrelevancy due to some poor political moves and misfortune following the Anglo-Irish treaty, having expelled Michael Collins from the Sinn Féin party despite Collins' incredible popularity, and then left SF himself later due to the influx of ex-Labourites into the party after the 1923 ban of the Labour Party as well as disputes with nationalists preferring a pro-German alignment which were in contrast with de Valera's belief in isolationism and neutrality. His breakaway party, Fianna Fáil, ultimately failed to be a success, becoming a minor party in the democratic opposition..."
 IRE_sean_lemass_leader_desc: "Seán Lemass was a volunteer during the Easter Rising and War of Independence and rose to become the head of the CPNH party, another breakaway party following the decline of Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish treaty. Lemass is an advocate for industrialisation and while he is a believer in capitalism, he also believes that normalising relations with the Union of Britain could have a beneficial effect on Irish trade and the economy. He is in favour of a flexible Irish foreign policy depending on the nation's needs, contrasting the CPNH from the other democratic parties who have their own biases in regards to Irish foreign policy."
 IRE_frank_macdermot_leader_desc: "Frank MacDermot is the youngest son of Hugh O'Rorke MacDermot, the Prince of Coolavin. He served in the Royal Army Service Corps during the Weltkrieg. Afterwards, he emigrated to America only to return to Ireland after the American economic collapse, and joined the anglophile National Centre Party, eventually becoming its leader due to his great oratory skills. A persistent critic of both the Collins' government and the democratic opposition's sympathies towards isolationism or Germanophilia, he is a strong advocate of a pro-Entente policy and rapprochement with the Loyalist community."
 IRE_michael_collins_leader_desc: "마이클 콜린스는 인기와 부정선거의 결합으로 권력을 지키는 아일랜드의 구세주이자 구국의 영웅입니다. 코르크에서 태어난 콜린스는 1916년 부활절 봉기에 참여했고 후에 아일랜드 공화국 형제단의 대통령이 되었습니다. 대전기 동안에 그는 1916년의 실수를 피하기 위해 IRA를 효과적인 게릴라 부대로 탈바꿈시켰습니다. 1921년에 그는 영국-아일랜드 조약에 협상하기 위해 파견되었습니다. 그는 독일의 지원으로 전쟁을 계속할 것이라고 위협함으로써 조약에서 32개 자치주를 모두 획득할 수 있었지만, 영국인들은 독립한 아일랜드가 곧바로 독일의 기지가 될 것을 우려하여 공화국을 얻어낼 수는 없었습니다. 에이먼 데 벌레라에 의해 신페인당에서 제명되었을 때 그는 자신의 정당인 피너 게일을 창당하는데 성공했고, 이 당은 신페인당을 빠르게 추월했습니다. 영국 혁명 후에 그는 아일랜드 독립 공화국을 선언했고 얼스터에서 영국 충성파의 봉기를 물리쳤습니다. 이제 제2차 벨트크리크가 다가옴에 따라 콜린스는 아일랜드의 독립을 지키기 위해 아일랜드의 경제와 군사력을 되살리는 것을 지지합니다."
 IRE_gearoid_o_cuinneagain_leader_desc: "Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin is a radical Irish language scholar, born in Belfast to a middle-class Catholic family, he joined the Army Comrades Association and managed to work his way up to Minister for Justice of Ireland as a result of his charisma, leadership and radical ideas which attracted the interest of ACA leader Eoin O'Duffy. As Minister for Justice, he passed laws repressing syndicalism as well as anti-traveller settlement laws against the Pavee community, as well as using his influence to encourage the Irish language. He also maintained links with the Romanian Iron Guard, expressing sympathy for establishing a similar regime in Ireland. To this end, he formed his own party Ailtirí na hAiséirghe that would revive the Irish language, ban the English language after a period of five years, and establish strong anti-syndicalist and anti-Semitic policies."
 IRE_padraic_o_maille_leader_desc: "Pádraic Ó Máille was one of the founding members of Sinn Féin and a member of the Irish volunteers, and leader of the radically Catholic and anti-syndicalist Irish Christian Front, supporting Catholic corporatism and an alliance with the Spanish Carlists. As a result of his anti-syndicalist views, he almost fell victim to an assassination attempt by the ICA in 1932, but managed to survive despite being badly wounded."

Similarly, much of Ireland's road systems are in a state of complete disrepair, and currently the responsibility for repair work of any kind falls to private enterprise. Our transport network in general could be considerably improved, allowing us to move both people and economic goods around the country at a more rapid rate. This situation calls for obvious economic expenditure, but we must keep the national debt in mind. More radical changes will encourage the population that we are serious about dealing with the issue, however."
 ireland.59.a: "Let's not push it too much."
 ireland.59.b: "We can make a more substantial investment."
 ireland.59.c: "This has to be the priority. Spend as much as we can."
 ireland.60.t: "Mechanised Farming Investment"
 ireland.60.d: "Because of our expansive investment policy, we have seen fit to implement more further reaching farming reforms than would otherwise have been possible. Mechanising our farms will finally help Ireland overcome the shadow of the Great Famine, and will help our population to grow."
 ireland.60.a: "We reap what we sow."
 ireland.60.b: "This might be a bit too expensive, actually."
 ireland.61.t: "Maintenance Board Investment"
 ireland.61.d: "The government has deigned to significantly invest in the RRMB project, allowing the new renovation team to create a larger number of personnel and conduct its business in a more efficient manner."
 ireland.61.a: "Full speed ahead."
 ireland.61.b: "We can live with a few potholes."
 ireland.62.t: "TransÉireann Investment"
 ireland.62.d: "We have successfully taken steps towards modernising our railway system, which will certainly help in the movement of people and goods around our fair nation. Our budget allows us to take this a step further however and make even more dramatic changes, but they will come at a cost."
 ireland.62.a: "There's no stopping this train we're on."
 ireland.62.b: "Put the brakes on this one."
 ireland.IFI.tt: "\nBegin §Yindustrialising§! Ireland.\n\n"
 ireland.64.t: "The IFI Initiative"
 ireland.64.d: "The government have ordered that extensive funds be made available for the rapid industrialisation of our nation. Too many Irish men and women are without jobs. Many British-owned factories were closed down when Ireland gained her independence, and have since fallen into disrepair. Ireland's industry lacks any real focus or direction, despite the population being eager and ready to work. It is up to the government to decide just how much of an investment into the civilian industry they wish to make."
 ireland.64.a: "A normal amount. Get the country back on her feet."
 ireland.64.b: "A significant amount. We need to be able to compete."
 ireland.64.c: "A major amount. Ireland can rise to greatness."
 ireland.65.t: "Saorstát Alcohol Factories"
 ireland.65.d: "Following the commencement of the IFI initiative, the Irish Department of Industry & Commerce have decided on perhaps a rather obvious choice to kick start Ireland's industry: alcohol. Ireland has a long and proud tradition of producing Irish whisky, but much of the production is done in small family-run distilleries throughout the countryside. The proposed Saorstát development will open up several alcohol factories and produce some much-needed employment for our nation, but the location for the development has yet to be decided, only that it should be in one of our less industrially developed regions."
 ireland.65.a: "Ulster. God knows, if anyone needs a drink, it's them."
 ireland.65.b: "Connacht. They need the jobs there."
 ireland.65.c: "Munster. They'll benefit the most from the profits."
 ireland.66.t: "The Pints Are Calling"
 ireland.66.d: "The construction of the Saorstát alcohol factories has finished, and now the nation can enjoy the benefits. The factories have not come without their expenses, but there's no doubt that they'll be good for public morale as well as the economy in the long-term."
 ireland.66.a: "Sláinte!"
 ireland.66.b: "Can we really afford this? Pull out!"
 ireland.fic.tt: "Create an international business centre in Dublin.\n\n"
 ireland.70.t: "Promote Dublin"
 ireland.70.d: "Our rapid industrialisation and economic reforms have created an attractive environment for foreign business. If we play our cards right and offer substantial subsidies, we can attract foreign powers to establish businesses in Dublin, turning it into a new centre of trade situated in the advantageous Atlantic. With London having fallen to the Syndicalists, now is our chance to pick up the slack and make it work for us. We need to decide how much funds we'd like to commit to our project, the larger an investment the wider our international reach will be, but as always, the spectre of the debt lurks over us."
 ireland.70.a: "Limit our reach to the obvious suspects in Europe."
 ireland.70.b: "Reach across the Atlantic as well."

 ireland.72.t: "The Germans Reply"
 ireland.72.d: "Our attempt at flirting with German businesses has been a success. The renown Krupp armaments manufacturer has announced the construction of a new Dublin subsidiary. This is bound to create a significant amount of new jobs, and the military complex will be selling directly to the Irish government. A win-win, as they say."
 ireland.72.d1: "Our attempt at flirting with German businesses has sadly been a failure. The Germans have decided to take a more protectionist approach to their domestic industries and have forbidden any foreign investment in Dublin."

 ireland.75.d: "Surprisingly enough, the Irish have sent a trade envoy to London, with an offer for British businesses to set up shop in Dublin in exchange for healthy government incentives. Dublin is being promoted as a centre of trade and commerce. The Irish must be desperate if they've come to us of all people with such an offer. If we allow this, we will likely profit from it, but so too will our potential enemy across the Irish Sea."

 ireland.67.t: "The Harland & Wolff Shipyard"
 ireland.67.d: "During the early 1900s, the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast had the prestigious honour of being the world's largest shipyard. After the capitulation of the British Empire during the first Weltkrieg and their second capitulation not long after to the Trade Unionists, it has fallen into disrepair and has been overtaken by other yards throughout the world.

 ireland.69.d: "The government's decision to orchestrate the creation of a national fund for investing in Irish industry has been well received by the public. Recent economic developments in the nation have been seen as an encouraging sign that the Dáil is committed to completing Ireland's economic rebirth.

 ireland.92.t: "A Small Step for Ireland..."
 ireland.92.d: "The Éireann Scientific Innovation Council (ESIC) is a newly created sub-department of the government, with one simple purpose in mind: a devotion to academia and scientific progress. Ireland has long been seen as a rural backwater by other world powers, a place that progress seemed to leave behind. Whilst a cruel opinion, it is not without truth. Centuries of British rule left Ireland largely neglected whilst the rest of the world raced on. It's time to catch up. The ESIC will be composed of expert scientists recruited from both the Irish population and from friendly foreign allies. ESIC research teams will increase our overall research efficiency and may even occasionally produce major breakthroughs in certain fields. The government must now decide how important the ESIC is to the nation: how much funds should they receive?"
 ireland.92.a: "Science is important, but it's not the only priority. A low amount of funding."
 ireland.92.b: "We will give them a prudent amount for such a key issue."
 ireland.92.c: "Ireland must leap from the past so that she can walk in the future. Massively fund the project."
 ireland.93.t: "Advances in Research Efficiency"
 ireland.93.d: "Thanks to steady funding by the Irish government, the ESIC has gradually been expanding over time and has grown in experience and efficiency, allowing them to tackle multiple research projects simultaneously. Ireland's scientific development is rapidly improving alongside the ESIC's own progress, and the investment is obviously paying off."
 ireland.93.a: "The news we've all been waiting for."
 ireland.94.t: "Impressive Advances Made"
 ireland.94.d: "Given time and plenty of funding, the ESIC has developed into a modern force in scientific research, to the point where Ireland is starting to be seen as a respected nation in terms of its research and development capabilities. No longer shall the Irish people be mocked as peasant farmers and louts!"
 ireland.94.a: "Back of the net."
 ireland.95.t: "Major Research Breakthrough"

 ireland.96.t: "The Dáil Decides: Immigration"
 ireland.96.d: "As part of their new IEAA initiative, the Dáil have argued for the expansion of Ireland's immigration policies. Under British rule, immigration to Ireland was almost non-existent and actively discouraged. Now that Ireland is free and her economy is growing at a rapid rate, there is an opportunity to start actively encouraging immigration. This process could prove extremely costly however, as significant funds will have to be invested in housing developments and administrative processes. There may also be social unrest with a large influx of immigrants arriving on Irish shores. Our choice of policy going forward will be very important for our nation, and it's important to consider the potential consequences."
 ireland.96.a: "Relax our policies. A few more people can't hurt."
 ireland.96.b: "Open our immigration up to the world. We've got the room to grow."
 ireland.96.c: "A new beginning for all. Make that known to the world. Encourage immigration."
 ireland.98.t: "Irish Immigration [GetYearBefore]-[GetYear]"
 ireland.98.d: "The year of [GetYearBefore] saw the world largely at peace, despite a few conflicts starting to occur throughout the globe. The Irish governments immigration laws and the state of the world at large contributed to the increase in the nation's population."
 ireland.98.d2: "The year of [GetYearBefore] saw the world largely at war, with many seeking refuge abroad in safe harbours. The Irish governments immigration laws and the state of the world at large contributed to the increase in the nation's population."
 ireland.98.d3: "The year of [GetYearBefore] saw Ireland embroiled in a war, which resulted in a much smaller amount of immigrants wishing to travel to the nation and settle there."
 ireland.98.a: "Alright."
 ireland.taxreform.tt: "Increase §Ytaxes§! to grant the government more economic freedom.\n\n"
 ireland.123.t: "Irish National Tax Reforms"
 ireland.123.d: "Over time since the passage of the IEAA and the economic and industrial revolution that has accompanied it, Ireland has slowly grown into a more prosperous nation. With that growing prosperity however, the taxation of the Irish citizenry has fallen behind. The people currently pay very little in the way of taxes, leaving something of an empty hole in parts of the governments treasury that could otherwise be filled. The government has decided to remedy the issue by increasing the national taxation rate. A higher rate will of course provide much needed economic freedom to the government, but it will not be without its societal consequences."
 ireland.123.a: "A sane approach is needed. Only a slight increase."
 ireland.123.b: "The people must give back to the government, too. A moderate increase."
 ireland.123.c: "We need as much as we can get to keep progress going. Hike it high."
 ireland.114.t: "An Irish Foreign Enterprise"
 ireland.114.d: "There is a widespread thought spreading throughout the government that, for the time being at least, Ireland has reached the limits of her natural resource exploitation. Whilst there may be greater riches still that lurk beneath the green fields of Éire, they have yet to be discovered. There are however plenty of greener pastures to be found abroad, with valuable resources to exploit. Irish economic planners have drafted a list of four nations in possession of valuable resources that Irish businesses could theoretically exploit in a lucrative foreign venture. Morocco, colony of the German Empire, is said to be brimming with iron ore and would make for a good steel industry. The Dutch East Indies are rich in rubber and oil, whilst South Africa is said to have an abundance of valuable chromium. Finally, there is the exotic Brazil in the Americas, known to have plenty of tungsten currently going untapped. We should develop our diplomatic relations with one of these nations and ask for permission to begin an enterprise in their territory, naturally in exchange for them having a share of the profits."

Apparently, the Irish are attempting to catch up with the rest of the civilised world and have taken an interest in opening up a foreign industrial branch in our nation. They have specifically targeted the Rhodesia region, known to be abundant in chromium. We currently have an operation there ourselves, but there is room for expansion. In exchange for the rights to export the resources back to their own nation, the Irish have promised to pay us a share of their profits."

Now we can begin planning the next stages of this operation. It won't be easy to set up a business on such exotic soil, but the Irish are a hardy and an adventurous people. We'll get it done."
 ireland.116.d.rejected: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has replied to our offer and, unfortunately, have chosen to decline. Although no official explanation is given, it stands to reason that they would rather eventually claim all of [IRE_foreign_resources_target_temp]'s resources for themselves, rather than be forced to split profits with us.\n\nFortunately, there are other countries that could potentially be negotiated with."

It's important that the expedition be led by a competent individual, but Ireland has very little experience in this particular area so the choice is a difficult one. The government have narrowed the options down to three choices..."

 ireland.125.d.sean: "General Mac Eoin has sent his first official report back from [IRE_foreign_resources_target] this morning. Despite some initial resistance from the local populace, he reports that an Irish mining operation is now very much under way and that the trade company can now start exporting [IRE_foreign_resources_type] to Dublin on a regular basis."
 ireland.125.d.paddy: "Our appointed 'specialist' in [IRE_foreign_resources_target] has finally submitted his first official report to the Irish government. It appears that our venture there has been quite disastrous to date and that the locals are not happy with the way Paddy and his entourage have treated them.

 ireland.126.d.luc: "While we may have initially been sceptical of the Irish proposal to establish a joint resource project, it seem those doubts were misplaced. The selection of a Belgian expert to head the project proved to be a wise choice, with operations greatly exceeding their initìal estimates. After Dublin took their cut, we are free to make use of our significantly expanded [IRE_foreign_resources_type] operations."
 ireland.126.d.sean: "With the first reports on our cooperation with the Irish to improve [IRE_foreign_resources_type] production coming in, results are broadly in line with expectations. General Mac Eoin, the head of the project, has proven himself a capable manager and deserves credit for getting things going. While the Irish will take their share of the resources, we can enjoy the dividends from our investment going forward."
 ireland.126.d.paddy: "With the reports on our joint investment coming in, many within our government are left wondering if it was all some form of practical joke. From the first day, the Irish-appointed head of the project, a Mr. O'Neill, seemed set on proving Murphy's Law correct. Many who invested in the scheme are furious at seeing their money squandered, and the meagre operation established, while admittedly providing resources, has little chance of surviving long term, let along providing any benefit."

There is room for a significant expansion of our steel enterprises in Belfast, if the funds could be made available to expand the existing steelworks and subsidies provided to hire new workers. This would provide us with substantially more steel than our present investment allows, but will also run up the national debt."

This will, as per usual, increase the national debt quite significantly if we choose to give the industry the maximum amount of funding possible. But the ends may be worth the means in this case, as we will acquire a valuable resource that our nation would otherwise be starved of."

The Irish Republic was founded however on the idea of a secular state, where religion would no longer play a role in politics. The promises of a secular republic have never truly been made good by the government, and the issue of the Church and its status in the nation has been a divisive factor for some time. The government has now saw fit to address this issue once and for all, and establish the role of the Church in legislation."

While this may sound appealing to liberals and the left wing in the Dáil, conservatives would not take this lying down."

 ireland.215.a: "We owe it to the resolute courage of the Irish people!"
 ireland.53.t: "Problems Up North"
 ireland.53.d: "Edward Carson, the former leader of the Loyalist Party, died last year aged 81. He was an extremely divisive figure whilst alive and fled to England when Ireland gained her independence and took back the rest of Ulster. He was particularly reviled outside of Ulster for his persecution of beloved Irish poet and author Oscar Wilde.\nAfter the British Revolution, he returned to Ulster, and made great efforts to differentiate the Ulster \"loyalists\", then called \"unionists\", from the despicable rabble of trade \"unions\" that held such sway in Britain. To this effect, the Ulster Unionism movement was effectively renamed, and had suffered a terrible blow by the revolution in what they considered the \"mainland\".\n\nHis memory was venerated today by loyalists in the north of Ireland, who held a memorial service in Belfast with several leading members of the ULP speaking in his name. The memorial attracted quite a crowd, showing that Carson still has power even in death. His spectre is looming over Ulster, just as the tensions and threat of rebellion loom over it as well."
 ireland.53.a: "He's a problem even from the grave."

 ireland.4.t: "Ulster at Peace"
 ireland.4.d: "After the recent unrest, the people of Ulster seem to once again be at peace. There's no telling for how long this peace will last, but there's no doubt that Ireland is better off for it. The Dáil has one less issue to deal with."
 ireland.4.a: "What a relief."
 ireland.5.t: "Disgruntled Populace in Ulster"
 ireland.5.d: "For some time now, there has been a slow but surely growing unrest in the northern region of Ireland, Ulster. Stirred up by predominantly Protestant Loyalists, who advocate for closer ties with Britain, Ulster has become something of a problem region for the Dáil. If this situation is not handled carefully, the issues that divide the region are sure to grow more incendiary."
 ireland.5.a: "This is a delicate matter."
 ireland.6.t: "Radical Movements Mobilising"
 ireland.6.d: "In response to what they see as oppressive policies towards the people of Ulster, Loyalist organisations are growing more radical and attracting the most disenfranchised and angry Northerners to their cause. They are presently meeting in secret in pubs and Orange Order halls around the country, safe from the prying eyes of the Gardaí."
 ireland.6.a: "Bloody radicals."
 ireland.7.t: "Riots in Belfast"
 ireland.7.d: "The streets of Belfast are in an uproar after the Loyalists have begun to make their play for a general uprising. Disgruntled Ulstermen, the vast majority of which are Protestants, have taken to the streets in a violent stand against what they believe to be hostile intentions from Dublin. The Dáil has called an emergency meeting to address their grievances, but that may not be enough to stop them."
 ireland.7.a: "Madness."
 ireland.8.t: "Civil War Imminent"
 ireland.8.d: "All measures, peaceful or otherwise, to try and pacify Ulster has failed. The Ulster Loyalists, backed by the Ulster Volunteer Force, have announced their independence from Ireland and have declared that they will defend the province of Ulster to the death from Dublin, and Catholic, rule. A civil war is inevitable."
 ireland.8.a: "God help us."
 ireland.131.t: "Radical Movements Diminishing"
 ireland.131.d: "The more radical elements of the Ulster region are slowly but surely diminishing. While the core members will remain as extreme as ever, they are finding it harder to recruit new members thanks to our latest policy changes. If things turn for the worse though, they'll most likely find followers soon enough, and we have to be wary. There's no peace in Ulster yet, only silence."
 ireland.131.a: "We'd best stay on our guard."
 ireland.132.t: "Riots Dispersed"
 ireland.132.d: "The streets of Belfast have been silenced and there are no riots anymore. Bricks, newspapers and trash litter the sideways as people return to work. However, the people who participated believe they have only lost a battle, not the war. In their work-place, at the pub and at home they whisper of when to strike next, not if."
 ireland.132.a: "At least they aren't in the streets."
 ireland.14.t: "The 1937 Elections"
 ireland.14.d: "Like every election since 1921 this one has been marred by corruption, voter intimidation and rigging. However, dissatisfaction with Collins rule has grown due to the Black Monday crisis with many ballot counters opting to take their jobs a bit more seriously. With the opposition taking part in a campaign of tactical voting, Collins faces the greatest challenge to his leadership."
 ireland.14.a: "Fine Gael party wins once more."
 ireland.14.b: "The democratic opposition wins!"
 ireland.15.t: "The Opposition Win!"
 ireland.15.d: "It seems that the Black Monday crisis was too much of a storm for Collins to weather and the opposition have managed to win despite the odds against them. Senior Fine Gael member, Richard Mulcahy has advised Collins to maintain some dignity and step down though Prime Minister O'Duffy has told him to take \"extreme measures\" to remain in charge."
 ireland.15.a: "Collins disbands the Oireachtas!"
 ireland.15.b: "Collins resigns in disgrace and vanishes into obscurity."
 ireland.16.t: "Collins Assassinated?"
 ireland.16.d: "With Collins' dissolving the Oireachtas, in the immediate aftermath there have been angry riots from the socialist opposition. In the chaos a disgruntled FF supporter has attempted to assassinate our president! Should he fall, the socialists will no doubt attempt to overthrow the government!"
 ireland.16.a: "Collins is dead and the ICA storm Leinster House!"

 ireland.250.d: "As per his promise, Mulcahy has finally held elections and unlike the last, have widely been agreed to be free and fair with no 'extra-legal' means at play. In the running is Sinn Fein led by Cathal Brugha, Fianna Fail led by Éamon de Valera, Cumann Poblachta na hÉireann led by Sean Lemass and the National Centre Party led by Frank MacDermot. Who shall win the election?"

 ireland.17.d: "With the 1942 elections finally arriving, the time has come for Ireland to once again go to the polls. With the democratic opposition more or less destroyed since the previous election, Fine Gael has gone in completely unopposed with many seats only having FG on the ballot. As the polls come in, Collins and FG have won every single seat in the Dail and his rule on Ireland has been cemented."
 ireland.17.a: "Another smashing victory for our hero."
 ireland.18.t: "The 1942 elections"
 ireland.18.d: "With democracy having returned to Ireland, free and fair elections are held every 5 years. Like the last election the main parties in the running are Sinn Fein, Fianna Fail, the CPNH and the NCP but a coalition of Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin's ANH and Patrick Belton's ICF could take the victory and shatter our precious democracy assuming they are able to take up NCP votes."

 ireland.22.d: "With democracy having returned to Ireland, free and fair elections are held every 5 years. With time wearing on, the NCP and ANH are no longer political forces leaving Sinn Fein, Fianna Fail and the CPNH as the main electoral forces. Who shall win the election?"

 ireland.22.b: "Fianna Fail take it!"
 ireland.22.c: "The CPNH score the victory!"
 ireland.33.t: "The MacNeill Commission"
 ireland.33.d: "Following the atrocities that occurred during the Ulster Loyalist Protest March, the events of which are now coming to be known as 'Bloody Wednesday' by Belfast residents, the government has launched a full investigation into the military's involvement and culpability in the massacre. Led by Hugo MacNeill, the commission has presented their initial report. MacNeill believes that, contrary to the claims by Liam Lynch and his soldiers, it was not the Loyalist protestors who instigated the fatal clashes with the army. Instead, he believes that Lynch and his men were looking for a fight all along and later planted weapons on dead protestors to give themselves an alibi. If these allegations are true, it's a shocking revelation and may have wide reaching consequences for the IRA."
 ireland.33.a: "Respect the Commission. Lynch and the army were at fault."
 ireland.33.b: "The army were to blame, but Lynch couldn't do anything to stop it."
 ireland.33.c: "Obviously, the Loyalists started the conflict. The army and Lynch are blameless."
 ireland.34.t: "The Trial of Liam Lynch"
 ireland.34.d: "Liam Lynch has today been brought before a court-martial presided over by the highest chiefs of the Irish Republican Army. He is accused of encouraging, perhaps even personally orchestrating, the massacre. The consequences of such a direct breach in military protocol are severe. The public have been incensed by the revelations of the MacNeill Commission and are baying for blood, no more so than in Ulster. It is up to the court to decide whether or not Lynch is truly guilty however, and if so, what punishment should be dealt."
 ireland.34.a: "Lynch is guilty. Discharge him from service and imprison him."

 ireland.35.t: "Problems with Integration"
 ireland.35.d: "From the start it was obvious that there would be some problems integrating the Irish-Americans into our Republic. The wealthier note the lack of democracy as they knew it in the US while the less well off feel that their situation is being exploited by Irish business. Locals also have grievances as they feel the newcomers are stealing jobs from them as well as seeing their cultural traditions as not in keeping with native Irish culture. To top it off Loyalists view the immigrants as an attempt by the Republic to colonise Ulster, where many have settled."
 ireland.35.a: "Something must be done!"
 ireland.36.t: "Loyalists Organise Protest March"
 ireland.36.d: "News has spread from Belfast this morning that the Loyalists are organising a protest march against what they perceive to be unfair treatment from the government in Dublin. Since Ireland gained her independence, the people of Ulster have become increasingly marginalised and attempts to 'green' up the region and purge the British legacy there have thus far failed. The idea of letting this march go undeterred does not sit well with the majority of the Irish people, or the government. But stopping it may only make the situation worse..."
 ireland.36.a: "This is a clear attempt to stir up trouble. Prevent the march."
 ireland.36.b: "It is their democratic right. Let it proceed."
 ireland.63.t: "Murder in Northern Ireland"
 ireland.63.d: "A local party secretary for Fine Gael, Sinead O'Connell, was found dead this morning on the coast of Whiteabby, only miles from the regional capital. Her body had obviously been taken some distance from the site of the murder itself. A letter claiming responsibility arrived at the Gardaí headquarters in Belfast, sent allegedly by the Ulster Volunteer Force. The murder appears to have been an act of retaliation for the government's recent decision to ban an attempted Loyalist Protest March. News of the murder has spread like wildfire across the nation, and the populace are shocked."
 ireland.63.a: "This is horrible. Something must be done about Ulster."
 ireland.37.t: "Loyalist Preparations Cause Tensions"
 ireland.37.d: "After a local government representative announced that there would be no official efforts made to prevent the Loyalist protest march, local Catholic residents have loudly voiced concerns to the regional Gardaí. They claim that the protest march is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to intimidate the Catholic community in Belfast, who find themselves still partially outnumbered by the Protestant, largely Loyalist, majority. The demands have not fallen on deaf ears and there is a growing call for the Irish Republican Army to be deployed along the planned march route to protect the Catholic community and make sure things don't get out of hand."
 ireland.37.a: "We must protect the Catholic minority. They are the true sons and daughters of Éireland."
 ireland.37.b: "Deploying the military against our own people? Nonsense. Let the Gardaí handle it."
 ireland.39.t: "Who Should Lead The Troops?"
 ireland.39.d: "The government has decided that a deployment of the Irish Republican Army will be sent to Belfast in order to secure the safety of the Catholic population during the upcoming Loyalist protest march and now an overall commander of the deployment needs to be decided upon."
 ireland.39.a: "O'Duffy is the best option we have."
 ireland.39.b: "Mulcahy will keep the situation under control."
 ireland.39.c: "Liam Lynch will protect the Catholic population."
 ireland.39.e: "Hugo MacNeill will keep the situation under control."
 ireland.38.t: "The March Begins"
 ireland.38.d: "Despite great misgivings among the population at large, the Ulster Loyalist movement have been allowed to hold their march. It is a miserable day in Belfast, and some had hoped that the torrential rain afflicting the city would have given call for the march to be postponed. Loyalist leaders gave the go-ahead however, and the march will continue as planned. The Irish government elected not to deploy military personnel on the streets of Belfast, leaving the monitoring of the protest to the local Gardaí instead."

It is a miserable day in Belfast, and some had hoped that the torrential rain afflicting the city would have given call for the march to be postponed. Loyalist leaders gave the go-ahead however, and the march will continue as planned. The Irish government has responded to the concerns of the Catholic minority in Belfast by deploying the 3rd. Limerick Rifles regiment to the city. The regiment have taken up strategic positions along the planned protest route and are commanded from the Belfast central headquarters by Eoin O'Duffy."

 ireland.40.t: "The Ulster Loyalist Protest March"
 ireland.40.d: "Sighs of relief were breathed up and down the country today as the Ulster Loyalist Protest March went ahead without any trouble breaking out. Whilst there were concerns that the Loyalists may turn their frustration into violence, these fears in the end turned out to go unrealised. Whilst this march has proven to be a contentious affair for the nation, at least it didn't result in any bloodshed today. Nonetheless, the Loyalists growing demand for independence can no longer be ignored. There must be decisive action to address the question of Ulster, lest the situation grow out of control."
 ireland.40.d2: "Terrible news has spread throughout the country following the Ulster Loyalist Protest March. Whilst it is still difficult to understand the full scale of what happened, it is understood that a conflict broke out between the IRA forces commanded by Eoin O'Duffy, and several of the protestors. The resulting violence left many of the protestors dead at the hands of army rifles, and the incident has quickly set the region of Ulster alight in a furore. Some cry for vengeance, others for justice, but one thing is certain: this is a black day for Ireland."
 ireland.40.d3: "Sighs of relief were breathed up and down the country today as the Ulster Loyalist Protest March went ahead without serious trouble breaking out. Under the watchful eyes of the Irish Republican Army commanded by Richard Mulcahy, the protestors were escorted through Catholic regions with only minor incidents taking place. The march has been an extremely contentious affair among the public at large and in politics, and many are glad that it has passed by without any serious issues. However, it's clear that the atmosphere in Belfast is a tense one at the moment, and many Loyalists did not take kindly to the presence of the military."
 ireland.40.d4: "Violent scenes marred the Ulster Loyalist Protest March today as widespread fighting erupted between Loyalist protestors and outraged Catholic citizens. It's unclear who threw the first stone or fired the first shot, but several people have been killed and many more injured. This incident is just another worrying sign of the turmoil quickly starting to grow in the north of Ireland. Truly a black day for the nation."

 ireland.43.d: "Following the shift in power that occurred when the British were chased out of Ireland, many Catholic business owners rose to prominence in Ulster. However, their rise in socio-economic status came often at cost to the Protestant residents of the region, who had previously enjoyed such unbridled dominance over the Catholic minority. A group of Ulster Loyalist factory workers went on strike today citing unfair pay and unwarranted treatment by their Catholic employer. Their strike soon turned violent when they were attacked by what some believe to be hired thugs. Nobody was killed, although Belfast City Hospital had plenty of patients in the immediate aftermath. This will not do the tense situation in Northern Ireland any favours."
 ireland.43.a: "This is worrying."
 ireland.44.t: "Murder in Derry"
 ireland.44.d: "The body of a young man was found this morning in a cold and desolate alleyway near the centre of Derry. According to a follow-up police report, he had been stabbed several times and left for dead. The man was previously known to the local police force as a prominent member of a Loyalist volunteers group with local ties in the Waterside. There have already been cries that the murder was committed by a Catholic and that the police will turn a blind eye. However warranted or unwarranted these claims may be, the situation in Northern Ireland is, as ever, volatile."
 ireland.44.a: "Frightening times for Derry."
 ireland.45.t: "Ulster Loyalist Party Holds Rally"
 ireland.45.d: "There was a massive turn out this afternoon for a UUP rally held in the city centre of Belfast. Thousands of Ulstermen and women came out in the sunshine to listen to prominent Loyalist speakers. There was plenty of time for song and dance, but just as much time for increasingly violent rhetoric regarding the status of Ulster in relation to the rest of Ireland. Whilst the words 'revolt' or 'uprising' might not have been spoken out loud, they were certainly thought. Of great concern to the Irish government will be the sheer number of people attending the rally. Clearly, the Loyalist movement enjoys widespread popular support."
 ireland.45.a: "This movement is becoming increasingly popular."
 ireland.46.t: "Concert Hall Attacked in Antrim"
 ireland.46.d: "In the latest shocking incident from Northern Ireland, a concert hall in County Antrim was subjected to a violent attack. Believed to have been carried out by the Protestant dissident group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, the attack saw several members of a Dublin band shot dead, as well as several concert goers. The motivation for the attack is believed to be another act of terrorism against the Irish state, acts that will continue as long as Ulster remains a part of Ireland, according to the movements occasional cryptic communications with the police and the public."
 ireland.46.a: "Awful."
 ireland.47.t: "Reprisal Shootings"
 ireland.47.d: "Seemingly in response to the recent violence carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force, five men with known ties to the group were found dead in a field near a farm twenty miles outside of Belfast. The victims appear to have been executed. It is believed that the men were rounded up during the night and taken together to be killed, although it is unknown at this time who might have orchestrated such an action. The tensions in Ulster are growing as the situation grows more violent, and the Irish government are facing increasing outcry at their apparent inability to address the instability of their nation."
 ireland.47.a: "The cycle of violence continues."
 ireland.48.t: "Craig Speaks Out"
 ireland.48.d: "After several years of inactivity and silence, the leader of the Ulster Loyalist Party has spoken out regarding the status of Ulster in the Republic of Ireland. James Craig, reported by some to have grown senile in his elder years, appeared lively and in a good mood as he viciously attacked the Irish government in his first major address of such a kind since the ceasefire of 1925. He particularly chastised the current regime and the economic neglect paid towards Northern Ireland during the past decade, and demanded that every son and daughter of Ulster be prepared to fight for the prosperity and, if needs be, freedom of the region."
 ireland.48.a: "He should have kept his mouth shut."
 ireland.49.t: "Belfast City Hall Bombing"
 ireland.49.d: "Terror awaited Belfast as the Belfast City Hall was subjected to a massive bombing that left over fifty people dead and many more injured. The shocking attack appears to be the latest in a long line of escalating UVF attacks, and was carried out during a meeting of local political representatives. Among those killed was Thomas Carlin, local party chief for the National Centre Party. This attack has frightened the nation, and the tension in Ulster has once again reared its ugly head but this time with devastating consequences."
 ireland.49.a: "The times we live in."
 ireland.50.t: "Grand Opera House Fire"
 ireland.50.d: "Horror at the Grand Opera House in Belfast. Several hundred people had to be evacuated in the midst of the evening's entertainment when a massive fire broke out, consuming much of the historic hall. Thirty-five people are believed to have died in the disaster and the toll could soon rise, with many still reported missing as search efforts comb through the debris hoping to find any signs of life. It is unknown what caused the fire to break out but the government is already being criticised yet again by Ulster Loyalists, who claim the incident could have been avoided had the Opera House been refurbished, as a previous request to the government had suggested."
 ireland.50.a: "What a disaster."
 ireland.51.t: "Bank of Ireland Robbery"
 ireland.51.d: "Today in Belfast, the Bank of Ireland was robbed by masked gunmen, believed to be Loyalist dissidents. The Gardaí are searching for them as we speak, but they are most likely taking refuge and being shielded within the Loyalist community."

 ireland.52.t: "Dublin Bombing"
 ireland.52.d: "At 10:30am this morning, a massive explosion went off near the Four Courts in Dublin. Five hundred people are believed dead and many more could follow when an official death count is taken. Two men believed to have been responsible for the bombing were shot dead by the Gardaí as they attempted to flee the scene and put up resistance when asked to stand down. At least one of the men has been identified as a Belfast native with known Loyalist ties. This terrifying escalation of the on-going conflict in Ulster is tantamount to a declaration of war upon Ireland and her people, and the public outcry has been enormous. The Irish people are baying for blood, and it is Ulster that may have to pay the price."
 ireland.52.a: "This can't go on."
 ireland.58.t: "Loyalists Planning An Uprising?"
 ireland.58.d: "Now that we find ourselves in an unfortunate state of war, there has been an unusual amount of dissent pouring in from the north of Ireland. Ulster Loyalists are said to be considering their options whilst the Irish Republican Army is preoccupied with the on-going conflict, and they very well may use this opportunity to try and break free from the Republic. The consequences of such an action could be grave for the nation, as they might very well attempt to align themselves with our enemies and would provide a perfect base for an invasion of Ireland."
 ireland.58.a: "As if we don't have enough problems as it is!"
 ireland.133.t: "The Loyalists Declare Independence"
 ireland.133.d: "After months of mounting tension, the inevitable has happened. The Ulster Loyalists have risen in mass numbers led by the Protestant demagogue James Craig, demanding separation from the Republic of Ireland. Basil Brooke has been elected president of the so-called 'Ulster Defence and Restoration Committee' and they have stated that they will defend their newly proclaimed freedom to the death, no matter how much blood might have to be spilled in the process. Barricades have been erected in Belfast and many Protestant militia have flocked to the cause of the Loyalists. Civil war is upon Ireland, and this time there will be no ceasefire as there once was in 1925. The fate of Ulster will forever be decided, one way or the other."
 ireland.133.a: "They are enemies of the state, and we will destroy them."
 ireland.133.b: "Long live free Ulster!"
 ireland.134.t: "War with the Loyalists"
 ireland.134.d: "The message from the Dáil this morning was loud and clear: there will be no independence for Ulster. The Irish public were relieved to see the mobilisation of the Irish Republican Army as the troops prepared to march on Ulster and restore order. It is hoped that the conflict will be resolved quickly and decisively."
 ireland.134.a: "Faugh a Ballagh!"
 ireland.135.t: "Civil War in Ireland"
 ireland.135.d: "It seems that our noisy neighbours across the Irish Sea have collapsed into a civil war. The long-standing problem of the Ulster Loyalists has reached a boiling point and now Ulster has declared itself a free nation and raised troops. If we'd like to reclaim the north of Ireland for ourselves, then now would be a good time to support Ulster, allowing us to deal a crippling blow to the Irish Republic without being seen to be directly at war ourselves. Of course, there is a chance that other nations in Europe might not take kindly to our interference, but the capitalists will never understand the higher calling that we here in the Union believe in."
 ireland.135.a: "We'll support them."
 ireland.135.b: "Send aid, but not too much."
 ireland.135.c: "They're on their own."
 ireland.136.t: "The Union of Britain sends Volunteers"
 ireland.136.d: "The Union of Britain have elected to send an army detachment to Ulster in order to aid our efforts to defeat the tyrannical Irish regime. Although we are certain that this assistance is not provided free of charge, we will be able to put these experienced and well equipped troops to good use in the civil war with the Republic."
 ireland.136.a: "We're grateful for their assistance."
 ireland.136.b: "We'll put them to good use."
 ireland.137.t: "British Volunteers Arrive in Belfast"
 ireland.137.d: "Irish spies in Belfast reported the troubling news today that thousands of British volunteers, army troops in everything but name, arrived in Belfast recently. It is clear that the Union of Britain are making an effort to support the Loyalist cause in Ulster, and our struggle has therefore suddenly got much more difficult."
 ireland.137.a: "To hell with the British. We will prevail."
 ireland.138.t: "Syndicalist Interference in Ireland"
 ireland.138.d: "Intelligence officials present in Ireland have reported today that the syndicalist regime in the Union of Britain has sent a sizeable 'volunteer' force to help the rebelling Ulstermen in the north of Ireland. This is clearly a clandestine military operation intended to overcome the Irish government. Many anti-Syndicalist hardliners in the German army are calling for a reinforcement of Ireland in reply to the boldness of the British, although there are some who feel that this is not our fight, and that our troops could be better used elsewhere."
 ireland.138.a: "This can't be allowed. Reinforce the Irish."
 ireland.138.b: "We can spare a few troops."
 ireland.138.c: "This isn't really our problem."
 ireland.139.t: "Syndicalist Interference in Ireland"
 ireland.139.d: "Intelligence officials present in Ireland have reported today that the syndicalist regime in the Union of Britain has sent a sizeable 'volunteer' force to help the rebelling Ulstermen in the north of Ireland. This is clearly a clandestine military operation intended to overcome the Irish government. Many anti-Syndicalist hardliners in the Canadian army are calling for a reinforcement of Ireland in reply to the boldness of the British, although there are many who are sympathetic to the Northern Irish cause and would not be happy if we were to side with Ireland."
 ireland.139.a: "We can't let Ireland fall into Syndicalist hands, send aid!"
 ireland.139.b: "We shall spare some volunteers."
 ireland.139.c: "The Ulstermen are our friends!"
 ireland.140.t: "The Germans Send Aid"
 ireland.140.d: "Germany has reached out to Ireland in the aftermath of Britain's interference in war with Ulster. In an effort to counter-balance the impact made by the Syndicalist troops, they have sent their own volunteers to Ireland, joining us in our struggle against the rebellious Northerners and the ever-treacherous British."
 ireland.140.a: "We are grateful."
 ireland.ger.volunteers.large: "Receive §Y6§! divisions in Dublin."
 ireland.ger.volunteers.small: "Receive §Y3§! divisions in Dublin."
 ireland.141.t: "The Canadians Send Aid"
 ireland.141.d: "The former British government exiled in Canada has, in a surprising move, pledged to support Ireland in her struggle against the Ulster Loyalists and their backers from across the Irish Sea. Several divisions of Canadian troops arrived in Dublin this evening and they will soon join the front against the Ulstermen."
 ireland.141.a: "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."
 ireland.can.volunteers.large: "Receive §Y6§! divisions in Dublin."
 ireland.can.volunteers.small: "Receive §Y3§! divisions in Dublin."
 ireland.142.t: "The Germans Send Aid to Ireland"
 ireland.142.d: "Grave news. It would appear that the German Empire have decided to reinforce their long-standing friend, and several German divisions have been deployed to the Republic of Ireland. No doubt the tyrannical government down south will waste very little time in turning those German guns against the good people of Ulster."
 ireland.142.a: "That can't be good."
 ireland.143.t: "The Canadians Send Aid to Ireland"
 ireland.143.d: "Treachery where it cuts deepest. The British Empire, or what is left of it, to whom we swore our loyalty for so many years... has decided to back the Republic of Ireland in their war to reclaim our precious Ulster. Canadian troops have arrived in Dublin and will soon be at the front. This day will never be forgotten by the Loyalist community."
 ireland.143.a: "As if things weren't bad enough."
 ireland.144.t: "The Germans Send Aid to Ireland"
 ireland.144.d: "Most likely in response to our own volunteers effort, the German Empire has pledged to support the Republic of Ireland in their struggle and have sent a sizeable detachment of volunteers to the conflict. It seems that our efforts to support the Ulster cause have not gone unnoticed in the international community, making the fight for Ulster all the more difficult."
 ireland.144.a: "Blast."
 ireland.145.t: "The Canadians Send Aid to Ireland"
 ireland.145.d: "Another blow. Despite the complicated nature of their relationship with the Irish, the exiled former government of Britain has decided also support Ireland against Ulster and our volunteers. Only a few dare whisper it, but our decision to send volunteers to the north of Ireland is beginning to look like it may have roused the hornets nest."
 ireland.145.a: "A minor setback..."
 ireland.146.t: "Ulster Uprising Crushed"
 ireland.146.d: "In a rousing address to a rapturous crowd in Dublin, government and army officials proclaimed that the Republic of Ireland have won a crushing and complete victory over the Loyalist rebels in Ulster. Although the civil war was a bloody one and the victory was won through hard work and sacrifice, the government has pledged that the Ulster question will nevermore trouble the people of Ireland, and that the Loyalist cause has been rooted out and the earth salted in its wake. One of the most divisive issues in modern Irish history has, it would seem, finally been put to rest."
 ireland.146.a: "Long live Ireland!"
 ireland.147.t: "The Irish Victorious"
 ireland.147.d: "Our volunteer detachment in Ireland has today reported back to high command that their mission to Ireland has been successful. The Irish Republican Army, backed by German arms and tanks, were able to decisively crush the Ulster uprising despite the attempts by the Union of Britain to interfere in the civil war. This is sure to bring stability to a troubled region and has seen our decision to send volunteers vindicated."
 ireland.147.a: "Three hurrahs for Ireland, and three hurrahs for Germany!"
 ireland.148.t: "The Irish Victorious"
 ireland.148.d: "The commander-in-chief of our military delegation to Ireland reported in this morning that the Irish Republican Army has retaken Ulster and completely crushed the rebel uprising. Despite the treacherous interference of the Syndicalist menace inhabiting the former centrepiece of the British Empire, the Irish military prevailed with our assistance. The Ulster question seems to have been thoroughly resolved for the time being, and Ireland stands united once more."
 ireland.148.a: "They call them the fighting Irish for a reason."
 ireland.149.t: "Ulster Defeated"
 ireland.149.d: "Despite our best efforts, the Ulster uprising has been decisively quelled by the Republic of Ireland. We received reports this morning that the Irish Republican Army had fully occupied the key cities of Derry and Belfast. We do not know what happened to the leaders of the Loyalist cause, but no doubt the tyrannical Irish government had them executed. Our attempts to meddle in Irish affairs has resulted in an embarrassment for our nation, and some within our government feel as if we should have left the Ulstermen to fight their own battles."
 ireland.149.a: "The Union of Britain will still prevail in the end."
 ireland.151.t: "Time For Peace in Ulster?"
 ireland.151.d: "It has been a long and bloody struggle, but Ulster has held strong against the aggression from the Republic of Ireland for a year, and many men, both Catholic and Protestant have died. We could push for a peace with the Republic if they were to acknowledge our right to independence. This would surely be the best course of action if we wish to avoid an even more prolonged conflict."
 ireland.151.a: "Offer our terms to Dublin."
 ireland.151.b: "We will continue the fight, no surrender!"
 ireland.152.t: "The Loyalists Send Peace Terms"
 ireland.152.d: "The leader of the rebellious Ulstermen, Basil Brooke, has sent his peace terms to Dublin. In exchange for an end to hostilities, he demands that the Republic recognise the freedom and independence of Ulster. Whilst it is true that the civil war with the rebellious northerners hasn't ended quite as quickly as many thought it would, to accept a free Ulster would be tantamount to political suicide for the Irish government. Nonetheless, some might advocate it as the only solution for a peaceful end to this conflict."
 ireland.152.a: "They must be joking. There will be no peace."
 ireland.152.b: "There must be peace. Give them what they want."
 ireland.153.t: "Dublin Says No"
 ireland.153.d: "The answer received from the Dáil was short and to the point. There will be no peace until they have received our unconditional surrender. The fighting will continue until we have either won our freedom through the spilling of Irish blood, or been beaten to the last man."
 ireland.153.a: "So be it."
 ireland.154.t: "Peace At Last"
 ireland.154.d: "Our offer of peace was surprisingly well received by the Irish government and they have agreed to an end to hostilities, recognising the independence of Ulster. This is a glorious day for the people of Northern Ireland, who can now truly consider themselves free from the tyrannical rule of the Irish and their disregard for Protestant traditions and culture. There will be no more fighting, and the island of Ireland can return to peace once more. Fledgling free Ulster now has a future to look forward to, guaranteed by the brave men and women who gave their lives to the Loyalist cause!"
 ireland.154.a: "This is a great victory!"
 ireland.155.t: "Time to ask for aid?"
 ireland.155.d: "Our involvement in the Irish Civil War appears to have angered the capitalist hive, invoking nations friendly to the Irish nation to send volunteers to aid them against the Loyalist's attempt at rebellion. Our volunteers have been a great asset to the Loyalist cause and a step towards securing Ireland, albeit through indirect means. However, now that hostile volunteer forces have joined the Republican forces, it would be fair to say that the civil war in Ireland is not necessarily developing to our advantage. If we were to invest any more of our own military even as 'volunteers' then it could be seen as a direct act of war by our hostile neighbours in Europe and across the Atlantic. However, if we were to ask the French if they might aid the Ulster cause we might be able to swing the conflict back in our interest..."
 ireland.155.a: "We need to ask for French support."
 ireland.155.b: "We've made our bed alone, we will sleep in it alone."
 ireland.156.t: "The Union of Britain Requests Aid"
 ireland.156.d: "The Union of Britain has sent an official request to the foreign office of the French Commune. They have drawn our attention to the ongoing civil war in Ireland, and have requested we send our own volunteers to help the Ulster separatists, although many might question whether or not this cause really deserves French support, given the radically anti-socialist and Protestant fundamentalist nature of the Ulster rebels. Agreeing to the request would see Commune forces depart for Belfast and, unofficially of course, aid the Ulstermen in their fight for independence."
 ireland.156.a: "A true cause célèbre. We shall send aid if it means that the fires of revolution grow stronger."
 ireland.156.b: "Who cares about their pet reactionaries?"
 ireland.157.t: "The French Agree"
 ireland.157.d: "It would appear that the French Commune is acquiescent to our request for assistance in Ulster. A detachment of French 'volunteers' is on their way to Belfast and will very soon arrive on the front lines to help resist the Republican forces. Surely, this will be a turning point in the Irish-Ulster Civil War!"
 ireland.157.a: "Excellent."
 ireland.159.t: "The French Decline"
 ireland.159.d: "Unfortunately, the French Commune does not consider the ongoing conflict in Ireland to be of any great significance or importance to the Internationale, and have expressed unease about the reactionary nature of the Ulstermen. It appears that, apart from our own volunteer forces, the Ulstermen are truly on their own against the superior numbers of the Irish army. Barring a full-on declaration of war, we have done as much as we can at this time."
 ireland.159.a: "That's the bloody French for you."
 ireland.158.t: "The French Commune sends aid!"
 ireland.158.d: "Apparently, we have more allies than we thought. At the coaxing of our British benefactors, the French Commune has agreed to send several divisions to our aid. The wind is at our backs now, we can surely overcome the Irish menace with the might of France behind us!"
 ireland.158.a: "No surrender!"
 ireland.160.t: "French Troops in Belfast?"
 ireland.160.d: "A report from military intelligence in Belfast has delivered the startling news that troops from the French Commune, volunteers in name only, have been seen disembarking from transport ships in the Belfast City harbour. They were greeted by a delegation of British and Loyalist military officials, making it quite clear that the French have sent troops to aid the Ulster cause. This is another clear attempt by the Union of Britain to steal Ireland back through a Loyalist puppet. The conflict has escalated yet again, but the Irish people will not give up until the matter is put to rest, no matter how much French, British, or Loyalist blood needs to be spilled."
 ireland.160.a: "This is our land. We will not let them take it from us."
 ireland.161.t: "Freedom for Ulster!"
 ireland.161.d: "The brave men and women of Ulster heard the call of freedom, and they were ready to answer it with blood and power of arms. Through a hard fought struggle, we have beaten the Irish Republican Army and won the civil war. Our independence has been secured and the Republic of Ireland is soundly beaten. We can now set up our own provisional government and rule over Ulster in a fair and just manner, where Protestants will be put first always, and the cause of Ulster Loyalism can be advanced in peace."
 ireland.161.a: "We've done it."
 ireland.162.t: "Ulster Victory!"
 ireland.162.d: "Unfortunately despite their brave efforts the Irish were defeated by the Ulstermen and their Syndicalist backers. This is bad news for Germany, and a victory for syndicalism over a key ally."
 ireland.162.a: "Verdammt!"
 ireland.163.t: "Ulster Victory!"
 ireland.163.d: "With the help of their syndicalist allies the Ulstermen managed to defeat the Irish government. Our support of the Irish has become a major embarrassment as many were sympathetic to the Loyalist rebels."
 ireland.163.a: "Damn it!"
 ireland.164.t: "Ulster Victory!"
 ireland.164.d: "The Ulster rebels have been victorious, and we have successfully weakened Ireland! This will ease the task of liberating the island from Capitalist oppression."
 ireland.164.a: "All hail Britannia!"
 ireland.55.t: "20th Anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising!"
 ireland.55.d: "On Monday, the 24th of April 1916, members of the Irish Volunteers, Irish Citizen Army and Cumann na mBan seized key locations in Dublin and declared a free Irish republic. Surrounded by the vastly superior numbers and artillery of the British Army, they fought on for six days before eventually surrendering. Most of the leaders of the Rising were executed. Although a loss at the time, it would subsequently lead to Ireland's war of independence and freedom after seven hundred years under British rule. Today is the 20th anniversary, and celebrations and parades have taken place all across Ireland, including a thundering speech from President Collins emphasising the need to protect the freedom that Patrick Pearse and his comrades died for."
 ireland.55.a: "For slavery fled, O glorious dead, when you fell in the foggy dew."
 ireland.56.t: "Anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising!"

 ireland.57.t: "Death of W.B. Yeats"
 ireland.57.d: "The famous poet and one of the founders of Dublin's Abbey Theatre, William Butler Yeats, has died today. He was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival and in 1923 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. He also served as a politician for two terms after the Irish War of Independence, but retired in 1928 due to poor health."
 ireland.57.a: "Ireland mourns a great poet."
 ireland.228.t: "Black Monday hits Ireland!"
 ireland.228.d: "On the 3rd of February, the German stock market collapsed, plunging the world into depression. Ireland has relied on trade with Germany and its sphere of influence since the British Revolution when we declared ourselves a republic and cut ties with the British Empire. The crisis has had a severe effect on the Irish economy as Germany and our other European trading partners have been hit by the crisis. Many scramble to find solutions, most parties proposing either Irish economic development or maintaining stability while the German economy recovers. More radically the anglophile National Centre Party advocate abandoning trade with continental Europe and opening ties with the Entente, often making speeches tinged with anti-German rhetoric. The syndicalists have also begun to advocate revolution, claiming that this crisis is proof of the failures of capitalism."
 ireland.228.a: "This could be bad..."
 ireland.229.t: "German economy improves"
 ireland.229.d: "The German government has begun to reform their economy to cope with Black Monday. With their economy improving, trade between our two nations has begun to resume, helping return our economy back to normal."
 ireland.229.a: "That's good at least..."
 ireland.230.t: "German economy recovers"
 ireland.230.d: "Germany's economy has finally recovered from Black Monday allowing trade between Ireland and Germany to fully recommence."
 ireland.230.a: "Great!"
 ireland.231.t: "War improves the economy"
 ireland.231.d: "The outbreak of war in Ireland has helped our economy to recover from Black Monday."
 ireland.231.a: "At least there's one benefit..."
 ireland.232.t: "Trade with the Entente"
 ireland.232.d: "Now that we have opened relations with the Entente our economy has greatly improved from trade with the British Empire. Perhaps the National Centre Party were right all along."
 ireland.232.a: "Great!"
 ireland.233.t: "Trade with the British"
 ireland.233.d: "Now that we have opened trade relations with the Union of Britain our economy has begun to improve from trade with what was once our biggest trading partner."
 ireland.233.a: "Great!"
 ireland.234.t: "End of Black Monday!"
 ireland.234.d: "Now that Ireland is finally free from capitalist oppression the reforming of our economy has eliminated the effects of Black Monday, the ultimate proof of capitalist failure."
 ireland.234.a: "Great!"
 ireland.235.t: "End of Black Monday!"
 ireland.235.d: "Now that our dream of making Ireland self-sufficient has become a reality our economy is no longer dependent on foreign trade, ending the effects of Black Monday!"
 ireland.235.a: "Great!"
 ireland.236.t: "Trade with the USA"
 ireland.236.d: "Despite America's unstable situation, our opening of trade has helped to improve our economy."
 ireland.236.a: "Great!"
 ireland.237.t: "America and the Economy"
 ireland.237.d: "With America stabilised and Ireland in a close friendship with them, our trade relations have become stronger and our economy has improved as a result."

 ireland.238.t: "아일랜드와 라이히스팍트"
 ireland.238.d: "While trade relations have been strong between Ireland and Germany since Irish independence, Ireland still remained somewhat outside of the Reichspakt economy, preferring to stay neutral. With Ireland now having closer ties to the Reichspakt the Irish economy has benefited."

 ireland.245.d: "Michael Collins’ time as President of Ireland has finally ended.\nCollins was credited with a major role in gaining Ireland’s independence from Britain, and with recovering Northern Ireland during the British Revolution. He held his executive position since then on massive wave of public support, which following Black Monday has seemingly fallen flat.\nAccusations of vote rigging and voter suppression were rife in the latest election, but even if any tampering occurred, such attempts have failed. Collins has lost to his opponents and resigned into ignominy, with the rest of his party calling fresh elections and returning Ireland to multi-party democracy.\n\nThe Big Fellow has left the stage, but who now takes his place?"

 ireland.246.t: "콜린스의 에러크터스 해산"
 ireland.246.d: "Unprecedented scenes have been reported from Ireland, where incumbent President Michael Collins has overturned the results of the latest general election. Seeing the possibility of relinquishing power in these troubling times to be putting the country in far too precarious a position, Collins has opted instead to disband the Oireachtas and rule by personal decree. This is officially described as a temporary measure in the face of the unstable situation that is gradually developing worldwide.\n\nWhether or not this is the case, the international media is describing this outcome to be the final result of Ireland’s vulnerable position next to the Union of Britain. The direction Collins’ firm hand will lead the country to from now on, remains to be seen."

In the riots that followed this announcement, a supporter of a rival party shot and killed the President, leading to a chaos erupting on the streets of Dublin. This furore eventually ended in the socialist paramilitary group the Irish Citizen Army seizing Leinster House, and with it, all apparatus of power.\n\nIreland is now expected to work closely with their old enemies in Britain, to further the cause of syndicalism worldwide."

Belfast once used to be a thriving industrial city and other towns and cities such as Derry and Coleraine were looking likely to follow. Revisiting this issue and energising the north with industrial investments will help to lift the region."

 IRE_set_up_dias: "Set up the DIAS"
 IRE_set_up_dias_desc: "While Ireland has three well-established Universities, they are lacking in investment, largely due to our rather stagnant economy. This is particularly true for post-doctoral research in the sciences. We should look to setting up a new institution that is focused purely on research, and in emerging fields such as Theoretical Physics. With this specialist focus, we could look to attracting leading figures from abroad, as well as encourage the growth of an innovative population."

 IRE_synthetic_fuel_project: "Irish Synthetic Fuel Project"
 IRE_synthetic_fuel_project_desc: "Although our people are industrious and our island ripe for industrialisation, there is no accounting for the unfortunate lack of natural resources available to us relative to the major powers of the world. Oil and rubber are particularly problematic, so if we would like to make use of these resources in our industries, Ireland must develop a functional synthetics programme."
 IRE_scientific_innovation_council: "Éireann Scientific Innovation Council"

 IRE_immigration_reform: "Immigration Reform"
 IRE_immigration_reform_desc: "The Irish population are eager and willing to work, but our nation is a small one. The state of our economy to date has been rather unimpressive and uninviting, but with the recent developments spurred on by the IEAA, perhaps we can begin improving this situation. Irish business would grow more quickly if we encouraged immigration from other less developed nations."
 IRE_improved_safety_regulations: "Improved Safety Regulations Act"
 IRE_improved_safety_regulations_desc: "Industrial accidents, factory sicknesses and other mishaps are frighteningly common in Irish industry. The lack of proper safety standards has been a cause for great concern among the workers and has seen them turn increasingly towards Syndicalism. We can all agree that no worker should feel like his workplace is a dangerous environment. It's time to make a change."
 IRE_safety_reforms: "Safety Reforms"

 IRE_women_in_workplace: "Irish Women in the Workplace"
 IRE_women_in_workplace_desc: "Ireland has in the past been a principally conservative nation, held in thrall to the Catholic church. Irish republicanism and nationalist movements have begun to influence opinions however, and there is a growing demand for women to be emancipated from the home and granted more independence, creating more employable workers and boosting our economy."

 IRE_national_tax_reform: "National Tax Reform"
 IRE_national_tax_reform_desc: "With the rapid economic change in our country, it's time that we start addressing our taxation laws.

 IRE_foreign_exploitation_contracts: "Foreign Exploitation Contracts"
 IRE_foreign_exploitation_contracts_desc: "Ireland only has a few natural resources and many of them have very few military applications. There is a whole wide world out there however, and Irish resource industries could theoretically be set up in the colonial possessions of friendly nations in order to harvest rare materials to fuel our industry and create a hefty profit."
 IRE_steel_city: "The Steel City"
 IRE_steel_city_desc: "Steel is an important resource and one of the few that Ireland can reliably produce thanks to her existing natural resources and trade connections. Belfast used to have a decent steel industry but much of the business closed down and moved to Dublin following the 1925 ceasefire. We could rejuvenate the steelworks once again and reap the benefits."
 IRE_zinc_mining: "Irish Zinc Mining"
 IRE_zinc_mining_desc: "Ireland has the potential to be one of Europe's leading producers of zinc. Although not particularly useful in the production of heavy military equipment, zinc is used in a variety of electronics and having access to a substantial supply of this natural resource would certainly be an asset for Ireland's research and development teams. It may also come in handy when building radar stations."
 IRE_zinc_industry: "Irish Zinc Industry"
 IRE_zinc_industry_desc: "Recent developments of our zinc mining industry have allowed us to harvest a significant amount of zinc ore, providing our research teams with valuable material for their electronics development.

 IRE_uniting_the_nation: "Uniting the Nation"
 IRE_uniting_the_nation_desc: "Some of the chief divisions of our nation could be addressed through a programme of cultural reform. Spreading the Irish language will help unite our countrymen, whilst addressing the long-standing hold of the Catholic church over Irish values and morality would be a progressive move. Our youth could see benefit in a scouts scheme, and perhaps our immigrant population can be better integrated with some effort."
 IRE_dealing_with_church: "Dealing with the Church"
 IRE_dealing_with_church_desc: "The status of the Church has long been in question since the declaration of Irish independence. Ostensibly, the Republic of Ireland is a secular nation, but some have questioned whether that is true. It's time to officially resolve the question of the Church once and for all in legislation, and with it direct the future of the nation."
 IRE_secular_supremacy: "Secular Supremacy"

 IRE_promote_irish_language: "Promote the Irish Language"
 IRE_promote_irish_language_desc: "The Irish Gaelic language is widely spoken in Ireland, but it has slowly decayed over time during the British rule, and in some areas it is now no longer spoken at all. We could better unite our people and preserve our cultural heritage by encouraging the use of Gaeilge throughout the nation."
 IRE_gaelic_national_language: "Gaelic, the National Language"
 IRE_gaelic_national_language_desc: "Frequent promotion of Irish Gaelic, or Gaeilge, as the national language has been a great success in uniting our people and easing the divisions. The language is quickly becoming every bit as frequently spoken as English, keeping the cultural heritage of Ireland alive and well."
 IRE_irish_scouts: "Irish Scouts"
 IRE_irish_scouts_desc: "Young Irish boys and girls often find themselves with very little to do in our society, and have often been left to their own devices as their parents work long toils in our factories and businesses.

We can take measures to better integrate the Irish-Americans into our society."
 IRE_status_of_ulster: "The Status of Ulster"
 IRE_status_of_ulster_desc: "Since Ireland gained her freedom, the status of Northern Ireland has loomed over the rest of the nation like a spectre. The Loyalist majority in the six counties of Ulster that make up Northern Ireland have felt increasingly alienated by the government's policies and tensions have been rising steadily in recent times. People are calling for serious action on the Ulster question, and the government is ready to take whatever actions are necessary to resolve it."

 IRE_re_occupy_belfast_desc: "The Loyalists have in the past raised threats about civil war and secession, and if they were to do so, we absolutely must not allow them to have Belfast under any circumstances. It has become our second most industrialised city and is far too precious to lose to the enemy, not to mention a strategic port from which the Loyalists could receive help. It must be put under military occupation."
 IRE_destroy_ulster_volunteer_force: "Destroy the Ulster Volunteer Force"
 IRE_destroy_ulster_volunteer_force_desc: "The Ulster Volunteer Force, these so-called freedom fighters, are nothing more than a band of terrorists.

 IRE_negotiate_with_loyalists_desc: "In 1798 one of Wolfe Tone's goals was to unite Catholic, Protestant and dissenter in an Irish identity, yet the British have set Irishman against Irishman in the name of religion and tensions still continue.

The aid of whom the 1916 Proclamation described as our \"gallant allies in Europe\" Germany proved critical in the War of Independence, while many Irishmen fought in the Weltkrieg on the side of the Entente.

 IRE_heavy_industrial_focus_desc: "Ireland is a small nation and can only spare so much space for a military arms complex. The military factories that we do build need to be built specialised for war, able to run efficient production lines and generate a high degree of output. We cannot waste our time with converting civilian factories into war-machines."
 IRE_medium_industrial_focus: "Medium Industrial Focus"
 IRE_medium_industrial_focus_desc: "To adapt to the ever-changing environment, it is vital that the Irish arms industry stays flexible. We might expect to be at war eventually, but that war will not last forever. We need to be able to adapt our industrial economy to war and peace in equal measure, and a medium industrial focus will do just that, with cheaper and more flexible military factories."
 IRE_heavy_production_drive: "Heavy Production Drive"
 IRE_heavy_production_drive_desc: "Faster, harder, and stronger: that's quickly becoming the ethos of the Irish military industry. We may not outnumber our enemies, but we will do our best to outproduce them."
 IRE_industrial_defence_plan: "Industrial Defence Plan"
 IRE_industrial_defence_plan_desc: "It's vital that our military industry not be crippled by enemy bombers during war-time. By constructing elaborate defence systems to protect our military factories, we will be able to minimise the damage done through enemy bombers."
 IRE_define_industrial_strategy: "Define the Industrial Strategy"
 IRE_define_industrial_strategy_desc: "Strategic decisions are made beyond the battlefield, too. Just as our generals must decide our army's priorities, so too must we decide upon our industrial strategy. A bi-annual committee will be set up to review our priorities and allow us to focus our production efforts on one major production line, increasing its output significantly."
 IRE_maintain_flexibility: "Maintain Flexibility"
 IRE_maintain_flexibility_desc: "Our military factories are designed to be cheap, quick to build, and easily torn down and converted when needs be. The same ethos should apply to what we build on them. New lines need to get up and running immediately and being able to swap and start on the fly will be of great asset for this 'mobile' industrial strategy."
 IRE_naval_industry_focus: "Naval Industry Focus"
 IRE_naval_industry_focus_desc: "If Ireland is construct a fleet of any particular relevance then she will quickly need to start constructing new naval facilities. Investment into the naval industry of our nation will be a step in the right direction towards protecting the Irish Sea, and our nation itself, against foreign aggression."
 IRE_cork_submarine_foundry: "Cork Submarine Foundry"
 IRE_cork_submarine_foundry_desc: "Some of our naval theorists believe that submarines might very well be the naval weapons of the future. If we want to heed their advice, then we'd better start producing more of them. By developing a specialised submarine foundry and testing facility in Cork, we can focus our naval production on the development of these predator undersea ships."
 IRE_dublin_destroyer_shipyard: "Dublin Destroyer Shipyard"
 IRE_dublin_destroyer_shipyard_desc: "Screens play a key role in any naval strategy. Ireland might not have much of a fleet to speak of at present, but our admirals know the basics. Whatever type of fleet we are likely to produce, screens will be important. A shipyard in Dublin could be adapted to focus upon the development of destroyers and light cruisers."
 IRE_belfast_capital_shipwright: "Belfast Capital Shipwright"
 IRE_belfast_capital_shipwright_desc: "Small ships and submarines are children's toys in comparison to the mighty visage of a battleship. If we're going to be taken seriously as any sort of naval power, we need to produce big, powerful ships. Belfast is the perfect place to start."
 IRE_an_taerchor: "An tAerchór"
 IRE_an_taerchor_desc: "One glaring error of the Irish military so far has been the lack of any air force, seen as too unimportant and expensive. With the British building one of the largest air forces in the world, it is vital that we correct this if we are to stand a chance."
 IRE_defend_the_irish_sea: "Defend the Irish Sea"
 IRE_defend_the_irish_sea_desc: "Britain's historical strength has been its navy, with which it could defend its island from invasion. The best way to cripple Britain's power and protect Ireland from a British landing would be to research and build a series of bombers capable of destroying ships."
 IRE_advanced_bombing_campaign: "Advanced Bombing Campaign"
 IRE_advanced_bombing_campaign_desc: "Now that we have researched naval bombers, we should use our newfound knowledge to research other kinds of bombers that can help us take the fight to Great Britain."
 IRE_protect_eire_from_above: "Protect Éire from Above"
 IRE_protect_eire_from_above_desc: "In the event of a war, the British air force would be able to invade Ireland's skies with impunity. We must research aircraft that can prevent this and shoot any tresspassing British planes out of the sky."
 IRE_heavy_fighter_programme: "Heavy Fighter Programme"
 IRE_heavy_fighter_programme_desc: "With our fighter research having been a success, we should now look into building heavy fighters, effective at a longer range than regular fighters and adept at destroying enemy bombers."
 IRE_expand_our_airfields: "Expand our Airfields"
 IRE_expand_our_airfields_desc: "Currently our airfields in Dublin and Derry are subpar compared to those of many other nations, we must bring those airfields up to standard."
 IRE_women_in_the_iraf: "Women In The IRAF"
 IRE_women_in_the_iraf_desc: "While many have been opposed to the inclusion of women in the Irish army or navy despite the service of the Cumann na mBan during the Easter Rising, attitudes are more open to allowing them to enlist in the air force, perhaps following famous American pilot Amelia Earhart's example."
 IRE_radar_technology: "Radar Technology"
 IRE_radar_technology_desc: "Now that we have built an air force for ourselves, we should investigate radar technology. This would allow us to detect enemy aircraft, making it easier for our planes to destroy them, as well as giving us intelligence on enemy troops and ships."
 IRE_an_tarm: "An tArm"
 IRE_an_tarm_desc: "Military tactics and doctrines have changed since the end of the Northern Campaign in 1926. The Irish army on the other hand has not. It is essential that we stay up to date when the outbreak of war in Europe is looking more and more likely by the day."
 IRE_direction_of_the_army: "Direction of the Army"
 IRE_direction_of_the_army_desc: "Currently our military is divided on how to proceed. Should we imitate the standard armies of other nations as we did in the Northern Campaign, or adapt the tactics and structure we pioneered during our War of Independence to conventional warfare?"
 IRE_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 IRE_mobile_warfare_desc: "Military strategy is changing, with mobility and tank warfare becoming popular. We too must keep up with the times, and begin studying mobility doctrines."
 IRE_motorising_the_saighdiuri: "Motorising the Saighdiúirí"
 IRE_motorising_the_saighdiuri_desc: "If mobility warfare is to work our regular infantry must be motorised so as to outrun the enemy otherwise our spearheads will be left stranded and vulnerable to encirclement themselves."
 IRE_armour_advances: "Armour Advances"
 IRE_armour_advances_desc: "Tanks are key to mobile warfare, forming the spearhead of an encirclement of the enemy. We must research tanks if our mobility tactics are to be successful."
 IRE_superior_firepower: "Superior Firepower"
 IRE_superior_firepower_desc: "The new mobility doctrine is primarily for nations that intend to invade others, which Ireland has no need of. Our doctrine should be focused on the use of artillery and preserving the lives of our men."
 IRE_small_arms_focus: "Small Arms Focus"
 IRE_small_arms_focus_desc: "An army cannot fight without supplies or ammunition. While German supplies and American donations proved helpful during the War of Independence, we must learn to research and produce our own supplies."
 IRE_dublin_arsenal: "The Dublin Arsenal"
 IRE_dublin_arsenal_desc: "Our doctrine depends on producing artillery so as to preserve the lives of our men. As we cannot just depend on just buying from international munitions companies we must study how to produce artillery ourselves."
 IRE_honourable_army: "An Honourable Army"
 IRE_honourable_army_desc: "Our army must be focused on order, discipline, and defence. While these tactics may have failed during the Easter Rising, they worked well during the Northern Campaign and are a better fit for conventional warfare."
 IRE_peoples_army: "A People's Army"
 IRE_peoples_army_desc: "Our army must be focused on speed and quick planning, adapting some of the tactics that allowed us to defeat the British during the Irish War of Independence to conventional warfare."
 IRE_patriotic_movement: "Patriotic Movement"
 IRE_patriotic_movement_desc: "Now that we have decided to adapt our War of Independence tactics to the modern day, we should promote a campaign comparing the modern army to the Flying Columns and that we pioneered these tactics to invigorate a sense of national pride in our people."
 IRE_the_fighting_irish: "The Fighting Irish"
 IRE_the_fighting_irish_desc: "While some of our forces are having trouble adapting to our decision, many Irishmen, some in Ireland and some outside, have fought for armies such as the American or British armies. We could hire their help to assist in training our troops."
 IRE_professional_army: "A Professional Army"
 IRE_professional_army_desc: "Now that we have decided to move to a more professional army, we must train our soldiers and officers, many of whom are still accustomed to the strategies of yesteryear."
 IRE_establish_officer_school: "Establish an Officer School"
 IRE_establish_officer_school_desc: "Currently, many officers in our army lack proper training as a result of our armed forces being descended from a guerrilla rather than a professional army. If we were to establish an officer training school which would train civilians and enlisted personnel in order for them to gain a commission as Irish officers, it would improve the quality of our military."
 IRE_womens_auxiliary: "Women's Auxiliary"
 IRE_womens_auxiliary_desc: "Women have much to contribute to our nation and its defence. We must open positions to those brave daughters of Ireland who would serve their country."
 IRE_new_flying_column: "The New Flying Column"
 IRE_new_flying_column_desc: "While the reforming of the Army has been a long process, it is now finally complete and the nation is stronger and prouder for it, knowing that in the event of an invasion the defence of Ireland will be in strong and able hands."
 IRE_an_tseirbhis: "An tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh"
 IRE_an_tseirbhis_desc: "Despite being an island nation and neighbouring to Britain, our navy only consists of a few destroyers mainly used for search and rescue of drowning fishermen. If we are to stand a chance against Britain's famous navy, we will need to expand."
 IRE_wolfhounds_on_irish_sea: "Wolfhounds of the Irish Sea"
 IRE_wolfhounds_on_irish_sea_desc: "During the Weltkrieg despite being outclassed by the British Navy, the Germans used U-Boats to great effect. Our first step should be to research submarine tactics so that we can also replicate this success."
 IRE_second_fenian_ram: "The Second Fenian Ram"
 IRE_second_fenian_ram_desc: "In 1881 Irish inventor John Phillip Holland created a submarine known as the Holland Boat No. II, nicknamed the Fenian Ram, for the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Now we must follow in their footsteps and build a submarine fleet of our own to defend ourselves against the British Navy."
 IRE_screen_research_project: "Screen Research Project"
 IRE_screen_research_project_desc: "The purpose of a screen is to scout for a fleet and protect it from submarines and aircraft, something that would be useful in detecting British submarines and especially Britain's infamous RAF."
 IRE_grand_fleet: "A Grand Fleet for Ireland"
 IRE_grand_fleet_desc: "If we are to stand up to the British, we must be able to build a fleet similar to their own. While this will take a long time it will pay off in the end, just as it did for Germany which once also had a far inferior fleet to the British."
 IRE_better_battleships: "Better Battleships"
 IRE_better_battleships_desc: "Now that we have begun to build a grand fleet to match the British, we should look into the building of a Super-Heavy Battleship. While it will take a long time to build and will be expensive, the results should be worth it."
 IRE_doctrinal_innovation: "Doctrinal Innovation"
 IRE_doctrinal_innovation_desc: "New doctrines are vital for modern war, so we should focus on them."
 IRE_muirshaighdiuiri: "Muirshaighdiúirí"
 IRE_muirshaighdiuiri_desc: "Now that we have expanded our navy, we should consider the training of an elite unit of marines to spearhead a land invasion. If this was to be successful we could finally take the 700 years fight for Irish freedom to British land."
 IRE_fortify_the_shannon: "Fortify the Shannon"
 IRE_fortify_the_shannon_desc: "One of Ireland's key natural landmarks is the River Shannon, dividing the east and west of Ireland. Our military has proposed fortifying both sides of the river, so that we can hold the line along the Shannon in the event of an enemy invasion."
 IRE_an_balla_eireannach: "An Balla Éireannach"
 IRE_an_balla_eireannach_desc: "Our next proposal for the defence of Ireland is to build a wall of coastal defences along Ireland's eastern shore, where a naval invasion is most likely to take place."
 IRE_anti_air_batteries: "Anti-Air Batteries"
 IRE_anti_air_batteries_desc: "Despite the grave threat that the British air force poses to Ireland, we have been slow to build any defences against them in the event of a declaration of war. This must change, and quickly."
 IRE_tearmann_citadel_project: "Tearmann - The Citadel Project"
 IRE_tearmann_citadel_project_desc: "While we have focused on fortifying the coasts and the rivers, the cities themselves have remained somewhat unprotected. We have come up with a plan known as the Citadel Project, the first stage of the project would be to erect land forts in our major cities protecting them from assault."
 IRE_citadel_dublin: "Citadel Dublin"
 IRE_citadel_dublin_desc: "The second stage of the plan is to completely fortify Dublin with forts, anti-aircraft equipment, coastal forts and radar. We must either choose to secure Dublin or Belfast as we don't have the resources to fortify both."
 IRE_citadel_belfast: "Citadel Belfast"
 IRE_citadel_belfast_desc: "The second stage of the plan is to completely fortify Belfast with forts, anti-aircraft equipment, coastal forts and radar. We must either choose to secure Belfast or Dublin as we don't have the resources to fortify both."

 IRE_officer_school_idea: "Officer School"
 IRE_officer_school_idea_desc: "The establishment of an officer school has aided the training of both old officers from the War of Independence and new candidates."
 IRE_come_woe_or_weal: "Come Woe or Weal"
 IRE_come_woe_or_weal_desc: "Ireland is once again alone at war against the British, and the survival of Irish independence looks unlikely. With nothing to lose the Irish people are willing to fight until the end."
