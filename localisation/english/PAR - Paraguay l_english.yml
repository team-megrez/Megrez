 PAR_self_sufficency_desc: "Paraguay's economy is in shambles, but its potential isn't. We should mobilise our budget to start massive industrial, agricultural and infrastructural projects. Paraguay's economy shall become self-sufficient so that we can exploit its full potential."

 PAR_reform_military_spending_desc: "Right now we spend tons of money to pay our soldiers, but we don't have enough money to equip them. If we spend less in conscripting and more in producing equipment, we should solve this issue while not cutting the military budget."
 PAR_national_liberalism: "National Liberalism"

 PAR_cut_military_incentives: "Cut Military Incentives"
 PAR_cut_military_incentives_desc: "Our military is quite enormous in comparison to the state. Our military spending is far too high, and it has not stopped rising. We need to cut military incentives before our state collapses under the burden of the military budget."

 PAR_women_in_the_workforce_desc: "Our country, despite being more than twice the size of Uruguay, has half its people.

 PAR_colorado_resurgence: "Colorado Resurgence"
 PAR_colorado_resurgence_desc: "The last Colorado president Paraguay has had was in 1912 with Pedro Pablo Peña who was deposed very quickly.

We shall reach out to the common Paraguayan and offer them the solutions the Liberals didn't give them."
 PAR_true_values: "True Values"
 PAR_true_values_desc: "The Colorados has always been a conservative party.

 PAR_increase_soldiers_stipends_desc: "The salaries in the army are meagre, to say the least, and a soldier's stipend is not the best, far from it. By increasing them, we hope we can at least make the conditions in the army more bearable for our soldiers, and especially for the conscripts."
 PAR_increase_military_industry_funds: "Increase Military Industry Funds"
 PAR_increase_military_industry_funds_desc: "It's amazing how we were able to field such a big, well equipped army with so little funds military industry. It won't be a problem anymore."
 PAR_faith_and_state: "Faith and State"
 PAR_faith_and_state_desc: "Our country has many strong social virtues, but one of the most cherished is faith. While we're by no means a monarchy ruled from Rome by the pope, we cannot deny the Catholic influence within our country, and we'd do well in taking advantage of our country's faith by allowing the Catholic church to play a larger role in our government as long as it doesn't hinder our power."
 PAR_abrilist_recovery: "Abrilist Recovery"
 PAR_abrilist_recovery_desc: "Back in 1934, we launched a successful coup and retook our country for the people. Unfortunately, we were deposed shortly after, but now we are stronger than before, and this time, we will be victorious!"
 PAR_military_revolution: "Military Revolution"
 PAR_military_revolution_desc: "Rafael Franco, before becoming a revolutionary, was a very influential figure within the army. While his short-lived coup and exile have soured his relations with the most conservative officers, many of his supporters come from the army itself who just wish to take Paraguay into a better future, and as such, are willing to help us in our revolution!"
 PAR_destroy_reactionaries: "Destroy Reactionaries"

 par.2.d: "아르헨티나의 새 대통령 마누엘 카를레스는 파라과이와 다른 나라들이 아르헨티나의 적이라고 여기는 중상모략을 서슴지 않고 있습니다. 오늘 아순시온에서는 수백 명의 사람들이 그의 모욕과 언사에 항의하기 위해 모였습니다. 그리고 우리 국가들간의 공식적인 외교 단절을 요구했습니다. 전쟁이 일어날 가능성은 없지만, 전쟁의 위협은 몇 년 전에 파라과이를 구한 사람들을 상기시켜주기 때문에, 이러한 위험은 군대에 정치적으로 유리합니다."
 par.2.a: "아르헨티나는 결단코 위대함을 되찾을 수 없다!"
 par.3.t: "우리 경제를 황폐화시킨 검은 월요일"
 par.3.d: "파라과이는 육지로 둘러싸인 나라임에도 불구하고 아순시온 항구와 리오 데 플라타 분지를 통해 보다 넓은 세계 경제와 연결되어 있습니다. 주식 시장 붕괴 소식은 처음에는 호기심으로 우리에게 도착했지만, 곧 그 여파가 느껴졌습니다. 외국인들은 우리의 생산물을 살 수 없고, 우리는 우리나라를 위해 필수품을 수입하는데 엄청난 어려움을 겪고 있습니다. 설상가상으로 예산 상황은 완전히 붕괴되었고, 퇴역한 군인들은 이미 무장하고 있습니다. 만약 우리가 어떤 식으로든 그들의 권리를 침해한다면, 그들은 그들의 권리를 방어할 준비가 되어 있습니다. 좋지 않은 시기가 다가오고 있습니다. 그리고 파라과이는 상업의 고립 속에서 살아야 할지도 모릅니다."
 par.3.a: "우리는 그것들이 필요 없다!"
 par.4.t: "군인 급여 문제"
 par.4.d: "Our budgetary issues predictably resulted in the reduction of the pay of several military officers, especially among lower ranks. This situation affects morale, leading to desertion, resignations and small protests in the army. Whatever we do, and even after we asked for their understanding considering the situation, the dissatisfaction continues to get worse."
 par.4.a: "우린 정말 그들이 필요해..."
 par.5.t: "연금수령자들의 항의!"
 par.5.d: "Veterans and other pensioners have protested in very large numbers after the announcement of delays to their payments. Usually, such protests would have been quickly over, but now the payment delays also extend to low ranking officers and soldiers who are normally in charge of dealing with such rabble and now refuse to intervene. With both local soldiers and veterans united in protest, there isn't much left to do about it than to wait it out."
 par.5.a: "Wait and the situation will improve."
 par.6.t: "군대의 불만"
 par.6.d: "급여 문제는 파라과이 병사 한 명, 한 명에게 영향을 미치지는 않았지만, 일반 병사들에게 상황 개선이 보이지 않자 불만이 병영 내 전염병처럼 번지고 있습니다. 일부의 소요사태와 다른 작은 폭동이 진압되었지만, 우리는 이 상황을 얼마나 오래 지속시킬 수 있을지 확신할 수 없습니다."
 par.6.a: "불행하군."
 par.7.t: "망명지에서의 라파엘 프랑코"
 par.7.d: "Ever since he was ousted from the government due to his radical syndicalist ideas, Rafael Franco further delved into Left-Wing rhetoric in exile in Chile. Now styling himself a 'Solanist Totalist', he clamours for Revolution in Paraguay from his exile. For years, few paid any heed to him, just one of the many deposed despots in this world, but now, with our position threatened, he directly calls for a coup that would allow his return. And the worst part is that he actually finds some who are willing to listen..."
 par.7.a: "미친 사람의 횡설수설이로군."
 par.8.t: "차코에서의 방해"
 par.8.d: "볼리비아의 더러운 음모는 끝이 없습니다. 그들이 우리에게 차코를 주장하여 그들의 기업주들에게 주기 위해 다시 침략전쟁을 시작함에 따라, 우리는 지난 전쟁에서 해방된 지역에서 침투요원과 사보타주를 마주하게 되었습니다. 그들의 방해는 작지만 볼리비아의 배반이 어디까지 갈 수 있는지를 상징합니다."
 par.8.a: "그들은 우리 방식대로 진행되는 것을 보게 될 것이다."
 par.9.t: "미국 대통령으로 선출된 휴이 롱"
 par.9.d: "전 미국 상원의원 휴이 롱은 믿을 수 없을 정도로 논쟁이 많은 선거에서 미국 대통령으로 당선되기 위해 성공적으로 노력했습니다. 생디칼리스트 및 표나 팔아먹는 후보들과 똑같이 경쟁하면서, 휴이 롱은 주요 주에서 승리를 거두었고, 우리의 부를 나누기보다는 팔아넘기려 하는 엘리트들이 아메리카 대륙 사람들에게 충분히 있었다는 것을 증명해 주었습니다! 많은 파라과이 신문들은 개표 작업이 끝나기도 전에 이 남자에게 칭찬을 퍼붓기 시작했습니다. 그의 숙적들이 패배를 우아하게 받아들일지는 시간이 말해줄 것입니다."
 par.9.a: "축하하네, 친구!"
 par.10.t: "미연합국 지원?"
 par.10.d: "The United States are under Siege! Huey Long has been challenged by Syndicalist and Banker thieves and they seek to enslave the people of North America by force. Long is an extremely popular person in Paraguay, as he was the only foreign politician to see the truth and denounce the war of greed Bolivia led against us in the Chaco, propelling him to celebrity status. The popular outcry was thus strong when news reached Paraguay, with many vocal unemployed veterans of the Chaco War demanding an official intervention. Tired of waiting, now all they request is material aid and ships to send them to the US to fight for Peace and Justice in the name of our nation."
 par.10.a: "우리는 미국 친구들이 그들의 나라를 자유롭게 할 수 있도록 도와야 한다!"
 par.10.b: "We can help, but we should be careful not to spend too much."
 par.10.c: "슬프게도, 우리는 여유가 없다."
 par.11.t: "차코 여단의 도착!"
 par.11.d: "파라과이라는 작은 나라로부터 용감한 차코 여단이 도착하였습니다. 미국에서 탐욕으로 들끓고 킹피쉬가 공개적으로 비난한 분쟁 지역의 이름을 딴 파라과이의 사람들은 그를 전쟁의 진실을 보고 있는 그대로를 말해주는 유일한 외국인이라고 생각합니다. 롱의 인기는 지난 몇 년 동안만 계속 상승했고, 민주주의에 대한 쿠데타 소식은 파라과이 국민들을 격분시켰고, 수천 명의 사람들이 미국의 영혼을 위한 마지막 투쟁에서 우리에게 도움을 주기로 결정했습니다."
 par.11.a: "우리의 명분은 정의다!"
 par.12.t: "파라과이의 축하!"
 par.12.d: "갈등이 종식되면서 드디어 숨 돌릴 시간이 생긴 것 같습니다. 파라과이 시민들로부터 온 편지들은, 킹피쉬가 자유와 생디칼리슴에 맞서 싸운 것에 대해 개인적으로 감사를 표하며, 롱을 진정한 영웅으로 여기는 작은 남미 국가로부터 계속해서 몰려들고 있습니다."
 par.12.a: "평화는 우리들의 보상이지만, 그럼에도 불구하고 우리는 그들에게 감사합니다."
 par.13.t: "Military Revolt!"
 par.13.d: "The recent cut of the military budget was the last straw. Temporary cuts in wages and delays in payments could be accepted, blamed on the situation. But attacking the military of the Paraguayan state, the sole hero of the Chaco War, could not have been done without consequences.\n\nHearing, the news of this plan, the rumours spread among the soldiers, in the barracks across the country, : \"Estigarribia has to go, he betrayed the nation!\". Several patriotic generals and officers took advantage of the situation and presented themselves as the alternative, touring barracks to expose their views and prepare an uprising.\n\nBack in Chile, Rafael Franco wasn't oblivious to the situation at home. Informed by frequent letters of his supporters, he orchestrated from Santiago a violent takeover, repeating his short-lived coup of 1934. In much the same way, his supporters in the army came and went into the barracks, preparing the minds with propaganda and securing the coup regiment by regiment. In this bubbling atmosphere, loyalties weren't gained only by morals, but also with bread. The seditious generals and Franco didn't hesitate to use their personal funds to win over useful regiments.\n\nFinally, several barracks rose up today across the country against our failed economic policies, and it seemed that democracy stood on its knees. The soldiers loyal to the Patriots or to Franco moved against places of power, and the takeover attempt degenerated into open fighting in the streets of Asunción. Some units still loyal to Estigarribia and the Colorado party have, however, sworn their loyalty to the regime, and fought to defend the democratic state. The fights took until dusk in the capital and claimed many lives, but finally the fighting stopped and when the dust settled on the presidential palace, there was a clear winner:"
 par.13.a: "Morinigo and the Patriotic Officers have saved the Nation!"
 par.13.b: "Franco's units have won, and the General was able to return!"
 par.13.c: "Units loyal to the Liberals and the Colorado were able to restore order!"
 par.14.t: "Huey Long Heading to Paraguay"
 par.14.d: "The War in North America took a turn for the worse, and Huey Long was forced to flee with the traitorous forces closing in on him. Nothing would please them more than his death, thus his request for asylum here in Paraguay was accepted immediately. The American hero is scheduled to reach Asunción shortly. A scheme involving ships with Paraguayan flags will ensure he evades capture by traitors, and once he gets here, he will receive a proper hero's welcome!"
 par.14.a: "We are waiting for him!"
 par.15.t: "1941년 선거"
 par.15.d: "It's election day in Paraguay, and the outcome of these elections is far from being clear, since in the previous ones no one got an absolute majority. The two main contenders are, as always, the Colorados led by Juan Manuel Frutos and the Liberals led by no others than José Félix Estigarribia. The results from the ballots are in, and the winner is..."
 par.15.a: "The Estigarribiato comes out on top."
 par.15.b: "Frutos and the Colorados secure a majority."
 par.16.t: "1946년 선거"
 par.16.d: "While the success in the previous elections for the Estigarribiato was a welcome surprise, now it is yet again time for elections. As per usual, the Colorados are the only other party besides the liberals that could achieve a majority, and with the ballots closed, the results are in."
 par.16.a: "Unsurprisingly, Estigarribia wins again."
 par.16.b: "Juan Manuel Frutos and the Colorados win."
 par.17.t: "1951년 선거"
 par.17.d: "The liberals were able to secure a majority with ease five years ago, but yet again, the Colorados run for the elections and could achieve a majority in the parliament. The results are in, and the party with a majority in the parliament is..."
 par.17.a: "The Liberals again!"
 par.17.b: "The Colorados are able to secure a win!"
 par.18.t: "1956년 선거"
 par.18.d: "Unsurprisingly the only two parties that can hope to achieve a victory in this election are yet again the liberals and the Colorados, with both conducting a very fierce electoral campaign, luckily without violence. Now the election is over, and the results are in."
 par.18.a: "The Liberals stay in power."
 par.18.b: "A surprising Colorado victory!"
 par.19.t: "1946년 선거"
 par.19.d: "Despite the success in the previous election, the Colorado rule is anything but secure as the campaign rhetoric ramps up to new hostile levels. While violence was avoided, many worry the elections results may not be recognised, but the Army has already declared it will ensure the elections will be orderly. As the dust settles, the Paraguay's president is..."
 par.19.a: "Juan Manuel Frutos, a Colorado."
 par.19.b: "Eusebio Ayala, and old school Liberal."
 par.21.t: "1951년 선거"
 par.21.d: "They say politics makes for strange bedfellows. As the Liberal's struggled to settle on a candidate, Luis Alberto Riart, once deposed from office, tries to run again for that party, running against consistently fierce Colorado opposition. As the ballot counting ends, the winner emerges as being..."
 par.21.a: "Raimundo Rolón, a Colorado."
 par.21.b: "Luis Alberto Riart, the Old Liberal."
 par.22.t: "1956년 선거"
 par.22.d: "Two military men meet in the unique battlefield of Paraguayan bipartisan elections. Raimundo Rolón has the backing of the Colorado party behind him, but his opponent has weight all by himself: José Felix Estigarribia wants to become president yet again, this time under a democratic framework. The winner of this battle of battlers is..."
 par.22.a: "Raimundo Rolón for the Colorados."
 par.22.b: "José Felix Estigarribia, the Old Marshall."
 par.20.t: "Paraguay in the Internationale?"
 par.20.d: "The tiny South American nation has recently experienced a socialist revolution and after initial stabilisation now looks at its role on the global front. While their contributions to the Internationale will be mostly negligible, an ally is an ally and we are in no position to deny further members to our alliance."
 par.20.a: "환영하네!"
 par.20.b: "Wasn't it called Uruguay? Doesn't matter, we don't need them."
 par.201.t: "France Denies us Membership to the Internationale"
 par.201.d: "Calling our nation an irrelevant backwater with no value whatsoever to their alliance, France has denied us membership and sent our ambassadors packing."
 par.201.a: "They will regret this!"
 par.24.t: "The Status of our Army after the Chaco War"
 par.24.d: "Our victory in the Chaco war came with a heavy price, we took on many casualties and left our country bleeding. Our troops were constantly underequipped and undersupplied, we were able to win only because of the fierce determination of our troops and because our generals excelled in leading them. However, many casualties could have been avoided. We need to reform if we want to avoid continuing in this path and suffering such catastrophe as the terrible war of the Triple Alliance again."
 par.24.a: "Reform is needed!"
 par.25.t: "The Hardship of Building a Modern Army"
 par.25.d: "Tanks and bombers. Incredible machinery capable of turning the sides of a war, but they come with a price. A price we can't pay. Our small nation can't afford to produce them since these equipments are incredibly difficult and expensive to make. Our few industrial units can't keep up with the cost and expertise needed to produce them. Obviously, this might change one day, but for now we should focus on our expert infantry army. This doesn't prevent us from investing in obtaining these technologies however, as it might be useful one day."
 par.25.a: "Let's hope we will see Paraguayan tanks!"
 par.26.t: "조기선거"
 par.26.d: "Adding to the economic crisis, a political crisis developed. The position of the Liberal Party which supports Estigarribia's regime was weakened, and the situation becomes more and more difficult to manage against the opposition. The conservative Colorado Party has been pushing for a while to hold an election to oust Estigarribia out of office. Today, the President announced that their wish has finally been granted, a snap election will indeed be organised. With the instability, Paraguayan citizens will be asked to choose between the security of Estigarribia's liberals and the fresh impetus from the conservative Colorados. Nothing is assured, and the ballots decree that the winner is..."
 par.26.a: "Estigarribia is able to hold but has to form a coalition with the moderate Liberals."
 par.26.b: "The Colorados are able to come out on top by a slim majority."
 par.27.t: "Mining Industries in the Chaco"
 par.27.d: "The Chaco War has been fought over the presence of oil in the region. While not present in the Chaco Boreal, this region has other resources to offer such as iron, bauxite and copper, very useful for our small domestic industry. Indeed we don't have the capacity to import a huge amount of resources, unlike other nations such as America, Germany or Russia, which have a huge mineral industry and a budget that allows them to trade and import resources without blinking an eye. Winning the Chaco war and acquiring oil helped us move towards that direction, but the deposits at our disposal are still very limited. Still, it's better than nothing, and we expect to be able to increase the amount of resources extracted year after year."
 par.27.a: "We shall work on expanding this booming industry then!"
 par.28.t: "Oil in the Chaco"
 par.28.d: "The Chaco war has been fought over the presence of oil in the region. While initial prospects made us expect to find oil in all of it, we were able to find it only in a small border region with Bolivia, very close to the border, but still in our hands. By controlling the most important resource in the world, albeit in a small number, we expect to be able to gain the upper hand in many negotiations, since almost all of our neighbours don't have oil fields nor have the capacity to import it. While we lack the numbers that Americans or Azeri oil fields can produce, this is still a relatively large amount, enough to be able to supply our small army, and with those refineries we expect to be able to produce even more oil both to export and to use for domestic use. This new industry should give a huge boost to our economy."
 par.28.a: "Since oil makes the world move, we might as well get involved in the business."
 par.29.t: "In the Hell of the Chaco"
 par.29.d: "This movie was shot in 1932 by Argentinian director Roque Funes. It describes the horrors of the Chaco war and how the proud Paraguayan army overcame difficulties until its victory. The movie was thought lost for years, but it has recently been discovered by the Estragó family. It has premiered in Asunción recently, was positively welcomed by the critics for its narrative and was praised by the army as very accurate and representative of the spirit of the Paraguayan army. This is a historical moment for the cinematographic scene of our nation, and we hope that this will inspire Paraguayan movie makers to be more enterprising."
 par.29.a: "Very nice movie, 7.8/10, not enough water."
 par.30.t: "Agustín Barrios tours America"
 par.30.d: "Agustín Pío Barrios is a famous Paraguayan guitarist who was able to achieve one of his dreams, that being touring America, with the first performance being held in San Juan, on the island of Puerto Rico. During said tour he was even able to play the famous song \"Every man a king\" with senator Huey Long himself when he toured the beautiful state of Louisiana, in Baton Rouge. Like most Paraguayans, Barrios admires Long for his stand against Bolivian aggression in the Chaco War. In this occasion the Paraguayan ambassador, who was escorting mister Barrios during his tour, expressed his best wishes to governor Long in regards for his presidential campaign, hoping that he will come out on top as the 31st president of the United States of America."
 par.30.a: "He was able to play Every man a king on a guitar? Mister Barrios is truly amazing!"
 par.31.t: "Snatching the Chaco region"
 par.31.d: "Now that Paraguay is busy fighting a war with Argentina, it's our moment to strike and seize the Chaco. While we can't realistically hope to take all of it since our army is still recovering from the defeat of the Chaco war, we can occupy the border region known as the Bolivian Chaco. Considering that the Paraguayan army is busy fighting the Argentinians, we are sure they won't wage war against us if we occupy it."
 par.31.a: "Occupy the region."
 par.31.b: "아니, 나는 그렇게 생각하지 않는데."
 par.32.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap]의 차코 요구!"
 par.32.d: "We received an ultimatum from [From.GetNameDef] - either we cede the entire Chaco region or they will declare war on us! It is a difficult decision; either we fight a two-front war or give away territories that were paid in blood by our nation several years ago. It may be wise to let it slide, since we can always come back later and focus on them once we have destroyed Argentina, but this move will be deeply unpopular. On the other hand, our national pride tells us to not surrender. We won against Bolivia once, we will do it again!"
 par.32.a: "We have to cede the Chaco."

 par.34.d: "There is no man more heroic than he who stands against giants, and there is no nation more heroic than the small one which defies those that seek to dominate them - and the proud Paraguayan nation has been at the mercy of her powerful neighbours for her whole life. In 1864, she chose to fight to preserve the territory that rightfully belonged to her and assert her right as a sovereign state, a decision that we nearly paid for with our lives. The insistence of Francisco Solano López on fighting to the death has left his legacy fiercely disputed, and our nation deeply traumatised - the sheer death toll the War of the Triple Alliance took was beyond all comprehension.\n\nBut in 1932, Paraguay stood up - once more, we defied the infernal designs of our enemies, wading into a war against Bolivia that the world thought we could never win. In the Chaco War, we shocked the world by routing the Bolivians all the way back to La Paz despite being outnumbered, defending our right to our country and proving that we are a power to be respected. After 60 years, the sorrow of our near-destruction had given way to triumph and renewed pride.\n\nAt long last, our victory is now complete - once again, we have stood against Argentina, and today we have come out the better. The bravery and cunning of our soldiers have cast our enemies from Chaco and Misiones, and have finally returned these long-lost lands to our nation. In the streets of Asunción and across the countryside, the people shout 'Victory!' and celebrate the avenging of 1870 - no more will we be at the mercy of other nations, no more shall we be cast adrift in the world. Come what may, Paraguay shall fight, against all who would harm her - the Guaranì spirit shall never be destroyed! They will speak the names of the heroes of Paraguay on all corners of the world!"

Estigarribia, however, has defied expectations and again risen through the ranks of the liberal party. Democratically elected, his hold on the state now is nowhere near as great as it once was, and though some fear he shall again seize dictatorial power, the masses cheer on the ever adaptable Hero of the Chaco War."
