There he met Manuel Gonzalez Prada, whose anarchist thoughts influenced the young Raul. He joined several protests against the Leguia regime, which would decide to get rid of him by granting him a scholarship to France. However, this move would backfire on Leguia, as the revolutions in Europe would influence young Raul and his friend, Mariategui, towards Syndicalist ideals.\n\nHe would go to Mexico in 1924, and with other Peruvian syndicalist exiles formed the 'Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana' or 'APRA'. The APRA would focus on pan-Americanism (or as Raul liked to call it, 'Indo-Americanism') and fighting imperialism and the bourgeois oligarchy that had settled in the continent. He'd return to Perú in 1925, settling in the north of the country with his fellow Apristas. In 1929, Raul led the Trujillo takeover, when APRA forces took over the city and proclaimed a Trujillan commune that would be lead by Raul, and executing the local garrison. When the revolt was crushed, he managed to escape to Chile, where he'd join forces with Churata and González Prada in order to strengthen the APRA for a new revolution in 1931.\n\nNow that Raul Haya de la Torre leads Perú, he'll bring about his dream of a worker's utopia for Perú, whatever the cost may be."

In 1919, Prada would become the intellectual leader of the newly formed 'Frente Armado Obrero', which would fight for better working rights in its most moderate form and for an outright revolution in its more radical members. Seeing the violence this group generated in Lima, Leguia decided to send the military to suppress the movement, ending the first Peruvian Syndicalist experiment. He then decided to retire from public life temporarily, gathering with other anarchists in Peru until the failed Trujillo rebellion forced him to go to Chile. There he joined forces in 1931 with Raúl Haya de la Torre and Gamaliel Churata with the goal of bringing the revolution to Perú.

However, Ugarteche would be forced to resign due to internal pressure, and Jose de la Riva Agüero would take his place, reinstating the hardline policies against detractors of the regime. Disillusioned with Benavides regime, he formed the Movimiento Democratico with the support of his brothers.

The grandson of the first Peruvian president, José de la Riva Agüero y Sanchez-Boquete, he graduated from the 'Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature, philosophy and law, and managed to get a PhD in jurisprudence in 1911. His first political move was to write an article criticising Leguía's government in that same year, for which he was arrested, triggering the first ever student protest in the history of Perú, which demanded Agüero's release. Agüero was released, where he became a teacher in San Marcos, but when Leguia took over the government in 1919, Agüero wrote a manifesto defending the constitutional order and left in a self-imposed exile towards Europe.\n\nThat travel to Europe changed him, as he was forced to witness the European recovery from the Weltkrieg, as well as the Syndicalist uprisings. It's in these circumstances that he meets D'Annunzio and Italo Balbo, whose far-right philosophy began influencing the once liberal Agüero. He returns in 1927 to Peru, after Cerro deposed Leguia, and began working as a history professor at the 'Pontificia Universidad Catolica'. He at first saw in Cerro just another dictator, but a meeting he had with the Caudillo changed his mind, as his experience in Europe and relation with thinkers like D'Annunzio and Carlés quickly turned him into a friend and close advisor of Sanchez Cerro. Although the hispanist ideals Agüero had were too extreme for Cerro, he was named head of ministers. With Cerro's death, he became his legal successor in the UR, although Benavides took over the real power upon his death.

 PRU_manuel_arturo_odria_amoretti_leader_desc: "José Manuel Arturo Odría Amoretti was born in 1896 in the city of Tarma, Junin department, Perú. He graduated the Escuela Militar as an infantry second lieutenant, where his grades were so high that he was granted an honorary sword, and named instructor for the school. He continued perfecting his military ability throughout his career, taking an important role in the war against Ecuador, but he never truly prepared to be a politician. As such, now that he's in power, he'll seek to restore the Peruvian democracy, but not before restoring stability to the country and enacting laws to prevent future Caudillismo. However, his rejection of the native population may cause trouble with the large Quechua-speaking minorities in the country..."
 PRU_eloy_gaspar_ureta_montehermoso_leader_desc: "Eloy Gaspar Ureta Montehermoso was born in 1892 in Chiclayo, Lambayeque department, Perú. He graduated as an artillery second lieutenant from the Escuela Militar de Chorrillos in 1913. After beginning studies in the Escuela Superior de Guerra, he'd be sent to Italy and France to perfect his ability as an artillery officer. A decorated officer, he joined the UR due to his ultra-conservative views and admiration for Agüero, even if they both had their differences. Now that Ureta leads the UR and Perú, he'll try to instil in the Peruvian society at large the patriotism and discipline he was taught as a cadet."
 PRU_carlos_miro_quesada_laos_leader_desc: "Carlos Miró-Quesada Laos was born in 1903 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. He graduated as a Lawyer in Lima in 1932 and joined the Union Revolucionaria. His diplomatic ways with other members and professional handling of propaganda for the party made him quickly rise through the ranks, becoming one of the possible successors to Agüero. Now that Miró-Quesada is in power, he's bound to continue the status-quo Agüero created and keep working forward for Agüero's vision of a glorious Hispanic Perú."
 PRU_luis_alberto_flores_medina_leader_desc: "Luis Alberto Flores Medina was born in 1899 in the small town of Ayabaca, Perú. He graduated as a Lawyer from the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in the late 1910s. He staunchly opposed the government of Augusto B. Leguía, for Flores would be imprisoned. He was freed after a decree by Sanchez Cerro, quickly gaining Flores's loyalty, who joined the Union Revolucionaria soon after. He accompanied Sanchez Cerro in his tour through Arequipa, Puno, Cusco and Ica, and would later become deputy for the UR. After the resign of Francisco Lanatta, Flores becomes the president of the council of ministers. During his time as president of the council, the crews of the Peruvian navy ships 'Almirante Grau' and 'Coronel Bolognesi' mutinied with apparent APRA influence. While Flores didn't believe the crews deserved the death penalty, the martial court determined they were traitors and had to die, so he came to the island of San Lorenzo with the prisoners, where he'd lead the execution personally. It is said that Flores himself forced each sailor to dig his own grave before being shot, earning him a reputation for cruelty in the UR.\n\nFlores became a close follower of Agüero, although he considered the latter to be too conservative in his approach against the APRA. Now that Flores is in power, he'll bring about his vision for a corporatist and totalitarian Perú, free from the influence of the decadent APRA which he'll hunt down relentlessly. However, his dream of absolute control over people of Peru is bound to shine through in his policies, and might upset the moderate or even conservative population..."

 PRU_country_intro_header: "1936년 페루"
 PRU_country_intro_content: "페루는 1821년부터 사실상 독립상태였지만 스페인 정부는 1871년 친차제도를 둘러싼 충돌 이후 양국 간의 평화가 찾아온 이후에야 식민지의 자치를 인정했습니다. 이후 페루는 볼리비아와 동맹을 맺었고 1879년부터 1883년까지 이어진 아타카마 사막에서 벌어진 볼리비아와 칠레 간 국경분쟁(태평양 전쟁)에 참전했습니다. 이 전쟁으로 페루는 타라파카, 아리카, 타크나 지역을 잃었습니다. 때를 틈타 영국과 미국의 자본가들이 페루의 채무를 탕감해주는 조건으로 약화된 페루 국영철도를 가져갔습니다.\n\n벨트크리크 이후, 1919년 아우구스토 레기아의 쿠데타는 페루의 민주주의를 위협했습니다. 1924년 멕시코에서 아메리카 혁명인민동맹이 결성되는 한편, 레기아 정권은 1925년 월 스트리트 대폭락이라는 거대한 위협에 직면했습니다. 위기에 대처하기 위한 개혁에 11개월 동안이나 실패하자 4월주의자들의 지원을 받은 노동자들의 폭동이 일어나기 시작했습니다. 사회주의 혁명을 우려한 군대가 사태에 개입했고, 루이스 산체스 세로 중령이 레기아 정권을 전복시켰습니다. 4개월 후 레기아는 페루 국가에 대한 각종 범죄 혐의로 유죄 판결을 받아 사형당했습니다.\n\n처음에는 세로 정권의 지지율이 낮았으나, 1929년에서 1930년 사이에 폭동을 진압하고 콜롬비아와의 전쟁에서 승리하며 인기가 크게 올랐습니다. 했기 때문입니다. 슬프 것은 얼마 지나지 않아 연설을 하던 세로를 한 4월주의자 암살자가 총으로 쏘아 죽인 것입니다. 동시에 그가 이끌던 혁명연맹은 혼란에 빠졌고 온건파였던 오스카 베나비데스가 페루 안정을 위해 연합 정부를 구성하기 시작했습니다. 혁명연맹이 재기를 준비하는 한편, 민주 정당이 끊임없이 선거 로비를 벌이고 4월주의자들은 세력이 기회를 노리고 있습니다. 페루에 어떤 일이 벌어지게 될까요?"
