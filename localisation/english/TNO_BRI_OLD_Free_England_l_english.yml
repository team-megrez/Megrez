 POLITICS_WILLIAM_ALEXANDER_DESC:0 "§w Born:§! June 10, 1910, in Ringwood, Hampshire, United Kingdom\n\n§w Military Career:§! William \"Bill\" Alexander, one of seven children of a rural carpenter, graduated from the University of Reading with a degree in Chemistry. Initially employed as an industrial chemist in a civilian setting, his strong belief in Communism and hatred of fascism led him to engage in several brawls, most famously at Cable Street in 1936. In 1937, his strong beliefs and anger over the British government's inability to take action against Franco in Spain led him to join the British International Brigade. There, Alexander was assigned to the anti-tank section, and quickly became known as fearless, though a disciplinarian. He was promoted to Captain in January 1938, though wounds suffered a month later would lead to his invalidation by that June. With the outbreak of war, he was recommended for a spot in Sandhurst by the Duchess of Atholl, where he graduated top of his class in 1940. Eventually reached the rank of Captain in the British Army, and served in the reconnaissance section in Africa and England. Post-war, was deeply involved with the Communist Party's underground activities, up to the Third Battle of Cable Street in 1953. Somehow managed to escape the abortive rebellion and subsequent crackdown on the CPGB leadership, fleeing to Russia. His experiences with the initial victories of the WRRF and its subsequent collapse cemented his strategy for England: any revolution would have to be from a broad and united front of anti-fascist groups. This led to a series of deals where he exchanged political concessions for alliances, including the foundation of the Left Resistance with Labour and the trotskyites in 1958, and his agreement to work with Claude Auchinleck's HMMLR movement in 1960.\n\n§w Important Notes:§! Holds an extremely large amount of sway with the Left Resistance, more so than Auchinleck, and is thus considered the de facto second in command of the rebellion."
 POLITICS_CYRIL_LLOYD_DESC:0 "Born: 14 April 1906, United Kingdom\nCareer: After receiving an education at Brighton and Cambridge, Lloyd commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1929. He rose to Captain by 1935, and attended the Territorial Army course at Staff College, Camberley. He saw action at the outset of the war with the BEF, holding a temporary rank of Major with the 12th (Eastern) Infantry Division. He evacuated from the continent from Cherbourg in June 1940. He became an Assistant Director at the War Office, but when the Germans invaded he was pressed into a combat command and received a temporary rank of Colonel. When news of the surrender to the Germans came, Lloyd could not bear to serve those who would sacrifice their freedom for mere survival, and resigned from the army. He began to make contacts with HMMLR, and took part in the unsuccessful London Uprising in the 50s. Though Lloyd holds no strong political beliefs, he holds great respect for the Left Resistance, gained by fighting alongside them in the doomed uprising."
 POLITICS_David_Stirling_DESC:0 "§w Born:§! November 15, 1915, in Lecropt, Perthshire, United Kingdom\n\n§w Military Career:§! Archibald David Stirling, descended from a line of Scottish aristocracy, attended Trinity College for one year before dropping out to focus on art. When war broke out, he stopped his training to climb Mount Everest and enlisted with the Scots Guards in 1939. In 1940, Stirling volunteered for No. 8 Commando and was assigned to the Mediterranean and North African theatres. His experiences in mechanized combat gave him the idea of a small unit penetrating deep into enemy lines to cause havoc. He fleshed out the concept over the next few months, and then broke into British Headquarters in Cairo to take his proposal directly to the top. The idea was deemed to have merit by Middle Eastern Commander Claude Auchinleck, and Stirling was given permission to form his unit, given the moniker \"Special Air Service Regiment.\" Abandoning the parachute aspect after a disastrous initial mission, the raids of the SAS against the German rear gave England a source of heroes and offensive action in a time when both were severely lacking. When England surrendered, Stirling, many of his unit, and some hardcore regulars deserted the army and reformed the SAS as a resistance organization, vowing to destroy anything German or collaborationist. The SAS quickly made a name for itself with a constant low-level pressure campaign of daring raids, ambushes, and assassinations. This streak was attributable to the intense training of the SAS, their support amongst the exile community of Scotland, and Stirling's inventiveness and commitment. Despite this success, the SAS did not collaborate with other resistance groups, as Stirling believed the communists were too far to the left, and the newer HMMLR movement to be too monarchist. However, their alliance in 1960 convinced Stirling that a general uprising would occur, and his paramilitary organization should take part in it. Thus, he brought his unit into the fold, which he was surprised to learn was headed up by his old commander.\n\n§w Important Notes:§! Utterly militant, yet extremely dedicated, Stirling commands some of the most highly trained and motivated rebels in England."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_HULL_DESC:0 "Richard Hull was never an ordinary man, one of the preeminent armoured commanders of the early war, scoring a scant few victories in the otherwise disastrous african campaign and even blunting the panzer attack on London for a time during the invasion of Britain, Hull would be amongst those who refused the surrender authored by General Montgomery, instead deserting with what little of his command he could salvage and winding up in the disparate Commando forces of David Stirling. Now that Stirling leads England, he chose Hull, long since proven as a loyal and trustworthy compatriot, to act as his second in command. A role he shall fill to the best of his ability."
 POLITICS_ORDE_WINDGATE_HMMLR_DESC:0 "§w Born:§! February 26 1903, in Nainital, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, British India\n\n§w Military Career:§! Orde Charles Wingate, born to a military family, graduated from the Royal Military Academy in 1923 with a commission as an officer in the Royal Artillery. Transferred to the Sudan Defense Force in 1927, where he learned Arabic and spent time organizing expeditions into the desert. Returned to the UK in 1933, and was placed in charge of retraining the Royal Artillery for mechanization. Posted to Palestine in 1936 as an intelligence officer, where he quickly identified with the Zionist cause. His Special Night Squads, patrol units tasked with counterinsurgency operations against Arabic saboteurs proved effective enough to merit him the Distinguished Service Order, though not without garnering considerable controversy for their policies of collective punishment. Was recalled in 1939 with High Command believing him too involved with Zionist causes to be effective, though he retained a large degree of popularity amongst the Jewish population. After the Second World War began, was again deployed to the Middle East to organize a native raiding force to attack behind Italian lines in Abyssinia, which proved extremely effective. A massie clash with his commanding officers over the treatment of him and his men afterwards led to depression and a suicide attempt. Assigned to the Far East in 1942, he began work on long-range penetration units to operate in the Jungles of Burma, and attack the Japanese where they least expected it. This led to the creation of the famous Chindits, soldiers relying on air resupply and radio communications to operate from bases deep inside enemy territory. These units garnered high praise in London, though their tactical and strategic usefulness was questioned by many. Ultimately, Wingate was captured along with many of his men, and spent years in a Japanese prison camp. Eventually, the Kingdom of England was able to secure his release, and cleared him to return to active duty in 1955.\n\n§w Important Notes:§! Constantly clashing with other officers and his commanders, Wingate is a staunch proponent of small unit commando tactics and a tough mental attitude to win battles."
 POLITICS_PETER_KERRIGAN_DESC:0 "Born: 26 June 1899, Glasgow, United Kingdom\nCareer: Peter Kerrigan was born in Glasgow. He apprenticed on the railways before joining the Royal Scots infantry regiment in 1918, where he served for two years. Kerrigan joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1921, making a name for himself during the British General Strike of 1926. He was elected as Executive in the CPGB in 1927 and became the party's representative in the Comintern in 1935. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, Kerrigan volunteered for the International Brigades, and served as a commissar for the English speaking volunteers. After the defeat of the republicans, he served as the CBGB's industrial organizer from 1939 until the party was banned by the collaborator government. Taking part in the doomed London uprising, Kerrigan was one of the few rebels to escape the wrath of the government. Present when Bill Alexander, fellow international brigade veteran, merged the Left resistance with HMMLR, Peter respects the fighting men and women of the non-leftist resistance. Ultimately though, his true loyalty lies with Bill and the remnants of the Left Resistance."
 POLITICS_FRED_COPEMAN_DESC:0 "Born: 1907, Suffolk, United Kingdom\nCareer: Fred Copeman has known the struggle of the working class all his life. Born in a union workhouse, Copeman had a troubled family life growing up, and was placed in Watts Naval School at age 12. After only two years he enlisted into the Royal Navy. While stationed in Malta, he was driven to question his beliefs by the absolute squalor he witnessed among the people living there. These beliefs were shaken in 1931, when he took part in the Invergordon Mutiny, in response to the government slashing sailor's pay. He was one of the members of the HMS Norfolk's strike committee. Though the community was entirely peaceful, Copeman and many other mutineers were discharged from the navy, some receiving as few as 12 shillings and a rail ticket. After this defining incident, Copeman joined an unemployed workers' movement, and was jailed several times for organizing marches and demonstrations. Copeman, like many of his fellow British socialists, volunteered for the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. Although he was wounded only months into the conflict, he recovered and rose to become the commander of the British battalion in 1937. Like many of his fellow veterans, Copeman lost some faith in communism, and a disastrous visit to the USSR as part of the CPGB's executive committee led him to leave the party for good. When the Blitz began, Copeman played a vital role in Home Defense where he managed an air raid shelter in the London Underground, saving many lives. Nowadays, Copeman is a proud member of the Left Resistance in HMMLR. Though he maintains his old communist beliefs, he has grown close with Harold Wilson, perhaps due to Copeman's wariness with the hardliners in the group that almost drove him away from communism in the first place."
 POLITICS_JAMES_KLUGMANN_DESC:0 "Born: 27 February 1912, London, United Kingdom\nEven from a young age, James Klugmann held communist sympathies. Visitors to the Klugmann household described the family as \"impeccably bourgeois\" due to his father's job as a tobacco merchant. Despite his upbringing, Klugmann did not seek to follow in his father's footsteps, and received an education at Trinity College, Cambridge, in hopes of a career in academics. However, after joining the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1933, Klugmann abandoned his pursuit of academics in favor of furthering communist causes. He traveled the world, seeking to find allies in creating a popular front against fascism. His actions attracted the attention of MI5, who couldn't pin any obvious crimes against him.Klugmann, meanwhile, was instrumental in the recruitment of Soviet spy rings such as the Cambridge Five. When talking of Klugmann, Arnold Deustch, head of NKVD recruitment in London said of him that he was fully devoted to the party, and very thoughtful and industrious, though those who knew Klugmann closely remarked on his quiet nature. In 1940, Klugmann joined the Service Corps, but was transferred to the SOE when his knowledge of languages was discovered. He was posted in Yugoslavia, and convinced the British government to support Tito's communist partisans rather than Serbian royalists. Though he and the Yugoslav partisans were successful in tying down several Wehrmacht divisions, the eventual fall of Europe ended Klugman's SOE career, as he deserted when news of British surrender reached him. After several years, Klugmann resurfaced in England, and made contact with the Left Resistance, surprising Bill Alexander and many others, who assumed he had died in Yugoslavia. Using his partisan tactics he honed in Yugoslavia, James Klugmann's name is feared among any Collaborationist soldier patrolling the countryside, and respected among the Left Resistance, second to only Bill himself."
