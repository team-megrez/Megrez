His quest for political power began early, a 17 year old college freshman when he, along with likeminded right-wing activists, founded 'Los Leopardos' in 1920. The Leopardos initially aimed to push the Conservative Party toward nationalism and corporatism, using newspapers to persuade voters. Carreno proved himself to be an excellent orator, becoming the face of the new generation of conservatives, expertly riling crowds with immense national pride and disdain for establishment politics. In 1938 he became a founding member of the Nationalist Action Party, and from the beginning has been second only to Misas in power.\n\nIn the subsequent decades, the Axis would defeat the Allies, the conservative party would fail to enact their agenda, and the liberal party would be overrun by leftists, all of which enabled Carreno to pull more and more public support towards the AN and its Ariocriollo mission. With the outbreak of La Violencia, Carreno's previous calls for right-wing militias appeared immensely prescient, while his promises that AN would free Colombia from vice, corruption, and Judeo-capitalism, inspired thousands to join the underground Second Patriotic Army. Since the Barranquilla uprising, hundreds of thousands listen to his nightly radio messages, and while his listeners may understand that Misas is the leader, it is Carreno whom they truly follow.§!"
 CLD_Klaus_Wilhelm_Lehder_eco_desc: "§YEconomy Minister\nAriocriollismo§!\n--------------\n§LBorn in 1904 in Hamburg, Klaus Wilhelm Lehder was but one of many German professionals who settled in Colombia in the first decades of the 20th century. But when he first arrived in 1927, he was one of the only National Socialists on the continent. As a young man Lehder owned a popular hotel in Quindío where he met a number of prominent German business leaders. Among them were Hermann Kühl, the de-facto head of the Deutsch-Kolumbianischer Bund, and aviation industry pioneer Peter Paul von Bauer, who hired Lehder as an engineer for his airline SCADTA. Through SCADTA, Lehder became acquainted with fellow nationalist Uribe Misas, the firm's legal representative at the time.\n\nWhen Misas founded the National Action Party, Lehder was among the very first to follow, his talents in management proving invaluable in shaping the party's internal structure. In the midst of La Violenca, he managed the ever growing pool of plundered goods that financed the AN's growth. When Kühl was killed in a car bombing in 1956, Lehder rushed to acquire his and other Bundists' assets for the party. For this, Misas promised Leider the future position of Economy Minister upon the creation of his Ariocriollo Utopia, a dream which both have absolute confidence in.§!"
 CLD_Luis_Lopez_de_Mesa_Gomez_for_desc: "§YForeign Minister\nAriocriollismo§!\n--------------\n§LBorn to wealthy academics in 1884, the 'godfather of Ariocriollo Thought' Mesa spent his formative years immersed in social science literature. This childhood fascination developed into a project to use sociology to perfect Colombian society. As a member of the Liberal Party, from 1917 to 1934 de Mesa rose from city councilor to cabinet member, spearheading education reforms in Pumarejo's first term and being appointed Foreign Minister by his successor, Santos. As the world was engulfed by war, de Mesa used his position to advance his racial ideology. He prohibited the entry of European Jews - including those who were Colombian citizens - as they fled from the Holocaust, while simultaneously working to isolate Colombia from the United States. These deeds made him a legend in the eyes of the far-right.\n\nThe Gaitan administration's decision to enact an open borders policy further fueled de Mesa's certainty of a Jewish plot to destroy Colombia, and he joined the Nationalist Action Party in 1951. For the next decade, he would regularly speak at DKB and AN events and publish papers outlining a Cold-War era agenda for advancing the Criollo race, ideas which would form the core of Misas' Ariocriollo Manifesto. Though today a fragile and sickly old man, de Mesa remains a highly valuable asset for the Second Patriotic Army, enabling it to outwardly portray itself as Colombia's legitimate government, rather than merely a German-controlled terrorist group.§!"
 Heriberto_Schwartau_sec_desc: "§YHead of Intelligence\nNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LBorn in 1917 to two German immigrant parents in Colombia, Heriberto Schwartau Eskildsen was already infatuated with National Socialism before Hitler became the Führer. After graduating highschool he purchased a ticket for voyage to Hamburg, wh Upon arrival in Germany, Schwartau officially joined the NSDAP and trained to fight in Hitler's army. In 1941, he was pulled from the Heer to serve the Abwehr instead, and Schwartau soon found himself back at sea, returning to Colombia to operate a pro-Axis radio station as part of Operation Bolívar. After the arrest of his superior in 1944, he became Head of Intelligence for the Abwehr in Colombia.\n\nAfter the chaotic elections of 1946, seeing the rise in partisanship and political violence as an opportunity, the Abwehr commanded Schwartau to organize Operation Lafitte, a mission to boost the influence of the National Action Party and further align its politics with that of the Reich, while also undermining public confidence in democracy by fanning the flames of political violence. Through a front company he established in Barranquilla, Schwartau began to smuggle German weapons, which he proceeded to sell to right-wing militias and crime syndicates through a network of locally recruited agents. When Schwartau revealed Operation Lafitte to Uribe Misas, they began a deeper cooperation. Schwartau's intelligence and supplies were essential to planning the Barranquilla uprising. Upon the successful seizure of Barranquilla, Misas appointed Schwartau as the head of the new Security Agency, through which he works to systematically undermine resistance to the new regime.§!"
 POLITICS_ALFONSO_URIBE_MISAS: "Nazi, Charlatan, Mob Boss, Lunatic. All insults commonly hurled his way, but not bothering him; liberals and communists would not mock him so intensely if they did not see him as a threat. Born in 1896, Alfonso Uribe Misas is a lawyer by trade. His successful defense of the DKB-linked SCADTA after a highly publicized plane crash left him in a position to negotiate an alliance between the DKB and far-right 'Leopardos', in 1938 creating the 'Nationalist Action Party.' Misas narrowly secured the AN's nomination for the 1946 presidential election, and his unexpectedly high vote percentage of 20% cemented him as the party's leader. Over the subsequent decade, increasingly certain of his own genius and disgusted by the wave of miscegenation and liberalism sweeping the country, Misas' thoughts converged on National Socialism.\n\nIn his 1953 'Ariocriollo Manifesto', Misas asserted that the 'Criollos' - Colombians of European ancestry - were the Master Race of the Americas, just as the Nordic Race were the masters of Europe. Though roundly mocked by wider society, it would inspire the formation of far-right militias whom Misas assembled into the 'Second Patriotic Army' (SPA). In the early weeks of La Violencia they killed hundreds in \"peacekeeping\" attacks against leftist rioters until driven underground by General Rojas Pinilla's forces. Protected by German-Colombian industrialists and armed by the Abwehr in 'Operation Lafitte', it would quietly develop into the best equipped rebel force in the country, and devise a plan to overthrow the Bogotá government.\n\nWhen full-scale war resumed, the SPA rapidly overwhelmed army and police garrisons in Barranquilla. While most Colombians (including 'Criollo') still despise Misas, as his revolutionaries now march across the country, all are now forced to reckon with the idea that the 'Ariocriollo State' will indeed take shape."
 POLITICS_HERIBERTO_SCHWARTAU: "Though born on Colombian soil, Heriberto Schwartau has never regarded the country he now rules to be his homeland. Born in 1917 to German immigrant parents, as a teenager he boarded a ship bound for the Fatherland so that he could fight for the cause of National Socialism. Assigned to the Abwehr, Schwartau soon found himself back in Colombia, and became the head of all Abwehr operations in Colombia in 1944. In this position, he masterminded 'Operation Lafitte', a two decade conspiracy to fan the flames of political violence in Colombia, undermine faith in democracy, and provide arms and training to Uribe Misas' so-called Second Patriotic Army.\n\nHowever laughable a distortion of National Socialist ideals his \"Ariocriolloismo\" was, Schwartau understood the need to work with Misas, and maintain unity of the Nationalist Action alliance to defeat the Reich's enemies in Colombia. But now, with the liberals and communists defeated, Misas himself dead, and the Nationalist Action Party hijacked by General Gil, such ideological excesses can no longer be tolerated. Who but Heriberto Schwartau has both the political acumen and the Aryan blood to bring National Socialism to Colombia? And who but Heriberto Schwartau can guarantee that Bogotá and Germania are forever adjoined?"

 IBR_colombia.5.desc: "Cartagena traced its history back to the conquistador Pedro de Heredia, who travelled the West Indies in the early 16th century and founded the city with two hundred men. Between the rivers Magdalena and Sinú the city was strategically important for the Spanish Empire in the Americas, and it grew flush with Spanish capital. Three centuries later, Spanish capital returned to Cartagena with the conclusion of La Violencia.\n\nPerhaps it is unfair to suggest it is solely Spanish capital here. There are Portuguese contractors too, such as Atílio Salgado, a specialist in infrastructure who walked along Central Caribbean Road with a notebook, recording road widths, the poor quality of the gravel and the damage it sustained in the battle to capture the city. But most of the Iberians who came to Cartagena were Spanish. Sergio Diaz held secret meetings with the new mayor, seeking favourable terms for his construction company. At the port, Oier Tarragona oversaw the first merchant ships from across the Atlantic docking, bearing peninsular supplies and ready to receive Colombian treasures. Biel Francisco Gallego stepped off one of the ships, suitcase in hand, ready to enter this newly-opened market.\n\nAnd in the streets of Cartagena, a young diplomat goes walking through the bustling crowd, ecstatic with their newfound freedom and an end to the violence that plagued this country for years. Jose Manuel Peralta held in his hand a large manila folder, inside which was a report from the Iberian embassy. It talks of the new government preparing elections, the hopeful mood in the streets, the eagerness for Colombia to return to the world; it speaks also of the government's appreciation for Iberia, and the assets their liberalisation has opened up. He entered the post office and handed the envelope to a clerk; FOR URGENT DELIVERY is stamped on the front, underneath which is the address of the Iberian Union's foreign ministry. Peralta returns to Cartagena with a light heart, eager to embrace the city he would come to think of as a home away from home."

He set the phone down on his desk to let Salazar get it out of his system. And it's not like he didn't deserve it. He was the one who had convinced Salazar that this adventure in Colombia would be worth it. He was the one who had spoken of reclaiming old glories, of Iberia once again having a place in the New World.

They all felt empty, confused and tired.\n\nThey had lost, and the men who sent them to this defeat were gone. They departed with the knowledge that they had failed Iberia - but on the voyage back home, they wondered what they were fighting for anyway. What was there in Colombia that was worth sending Iberians to die? Their comrades died for a cause they could no longer recall; all the survivors had were their lives, irreparably scarred by this failure.\n\nIn the distance, the lights of the harbour glittered. The air was pleasantly cold and dry, welcome relief from the Colombian jungles. No longer would they suffer the oppressive wet heat; no longer would they suffer communist or republican bullets and blades; and no longer would they suffer the dreams of old men in Madrid.\n\nEach man carried a testimony of regret, failure and betrayal they would not only carry in their hearts, but testify to all Iberia. They would tell it in the family home, fathers recalling sanitised versions of the war for their children. They would tell it in the inns and pubs of Iberia, drunken wretches crying into their cups for lost comrades at three in the morning.

Across the room from them was an auctioneer, a government representative and a map of New Grenada. They had overlaid lot numbers on the map: the positions of rich estates, fertile valleys and fields most suitable to growing Colombia's finest crop.\n\nIn the estates, a colonel enjoys the first day of his retirement. He intended to grow fat on the lucre he had won from the civil war - half of which he had stolen from Jewish families marked traitors to the state by Alzate. The estate was a beautiful colonial holdover, atop a great hill underneath which were vast fields, and a little town that had grown around a small lake. But he did not own it all, not truly. He knew he was but the representative of another man, who let him play landlord for a reasonable fee. \"Sold, to the gentleman from Sapporo, for three million.\"\n\nA group of farmers were held up by the roadside. Patted down, humiliated, struck in the stomach with the butt of a rifle. New Granadan soldiers raided their caravan, took the crops they had wanted to send to market. Their commander thought himself fair, and left behind a bill with El Duce's face on them. Dejected, the farmers trekked back to their fields, only to find more men bearing a deed to the land, and an order to kick out the squatters. \"Sold, to the gentleman from Milan, for four million.\"\n\nThe village tried to put the war behind them, but the scars remained. When they closed their eyes they still saw the militias descending upon the valley like an avalanche. When they left, seven were dead. The soldiers called them Marxist saboteurs - their only crime was being a village in URC territory. But they were poor, and thought themselves below the attention of anyone else, until a strange man had come and taken samples of their soil.

In his typewriter was the last page of a report that would launch his career in the Company into the stratosphere: a report on the success of the URC in the Colombian Civil War. Langley would hear of the crucial role he played in the affair, and they would reward his ten long years trapped in what he once thought was a God-forsaken jungle. Perhaps the coffee was a little bitter, but his victory tasted sweet.\n\nThe victors were an odd bunch: a popular front of democrats, liberal reformists, left-wing activists and a smattering of communists. Holden would assure his superiors that the latter would not interfere with the general pro-American sentiment of the URC. Gaitán was himself a staunch pan-American who sought to warm his country with the torch of freedom, and the Gaitanistas held onto those beliefs from the beginning. All Langley needed to be cautioned was against overt interference with their markets. He couldn't help but editorialise: let the Colombians develop their economy, offer them capital and let them decide for themselves which foreign companies should be permitted to invest. You'll still get a grip on their economy, and everyone will be happy.\n\nIt wasn't patriotic pride that made Holden smile. It was pride in his own efforts. Ten long years in Colombia, helping run this station, and he had an entire nation to show for it. He took a sip of his bitter coffee, the prized crop of this country. At first he hated it - his cups were once always three-quarters milk - but over time he grew to appreciate its strong, bold flavour. His appreciation for Colombian coffee grew with his appreciation for Colombia, from hated exile to proud caretaker.

Henry could hear the government soldiers advancing, seemingly just at their heels.\n\nHolden slumped wheezing against a tree. Henry turned and yelled \"What the fuck are you doing?\"\n\n\"Just need to get my brea-\" Holden's words were cut off by a gunshot followed by a scream. Henry ran with doubled speed. Bursting through the trees, he found himself staring down at the Orinoco River. Henry took a deep breath and leapt off the edge of the bank.\n\nHe had planned to swim to the other side, but found that impossible. His eyes burned in the murky water, and the rush of the river stole all sound from his ears. He tried to push in the direction he assumed was the opposite shore, but his muscles quickly tired and his lungs burned. When a hand grabbed his back and pulled him from the water, the relief almost drowned out the fear.\n\nHe was sprawled on the deck of a small motorboat, driven by a soldier. Another soldier sat near him, his gun at the ready. Henry sat up and looked to the shore they were headed for. On it he saw several more soldiers and Holden, sitting with a bloody bandage on his leg.

Only a jumble emerged, thousands of scraps fighting for relevance in his mind as his body marched through the Colombian jungle. He was stripped and blindfolded, forced to march through the unforgiving jungle by a victorious enemy. He tried to explain who he was - not an agent, not a soldier, but a secretary. His captors do not care. He marches to his death with the rest of the Yankees.\n\nPeeled bark and fallen branches crunch and splinter below his bleeding feet. The cold barrel of a rifle presses into his back, driving him forward whenever his body tries to rest. Holden wishes he could hear the birds above him clearly. He would like to die with their song to comfort him, but the jeering of soldiers and the loud crunch of the debris below him drown out their song.\n\nIn the din of his mind, new thoughts emerge, memories of reports terrifyingly clearer than the ones he tries to remember. New Granadan forces had been creative with their torture of local collaborators. Holden read the reports; he even wrote a few of them. They had long eschewed conventional force and developed new ways of inflicting pain on men. They had even taken to mimicking medieval forms of torture. He tried to fend off these thoughts, but once they revealed themselves it was impossible to forget. Holden's legs almost gave out, but another sharp thrust of a gun barrel in his back forced him to keep stable and walk towards horrors he'd only read about.\n\nSome four thousand miles away, a report crosses the Resolute Desk. It puts the Colombian situation in plain terms: assets that have not been extracted at the time of writing are considered lost. The torch of liberty shall not fall on New Granada.

A man might lose control of his horses, his mind occupied by the wife he lost in a skirmish, and the entire town locks themselves away against the stampede. Fishermen and tappers hesitate to set sail across the border in the Amazonas. Shelled-out housing complexes are quietly abandoned, their old tenants forced to migrate; nobody wishes to inhabit the husks left behind by war.\n\nBogotá felt that hush at first. People walked hesitantly, close to the entrances of buildings, ready to dive into cover once the shooting started again. But slowly, people understood that it was over. Brazil's men won in Colombia, and peace was in their foreseeable future.\n\nAnd with peace came foreign investment. Though foreign ships bearing unfamiliar flags startled many, the Brazilians came with open arms and heavy purses, ready to help the rebuilding effort and reap a good reward in response. Delegations met in the least-affected hotels of Bogotá to draw up trade deals, presidents exchanged telephone calls to congratulate Colombia on their newfound victory. Fishing ships hail each other, discuss the day's catch, exchange smokes and pleasant conversation about the clear blue sky.\n\nThere's still a hesitation in the air.

On the edge of the camp's light Lieutenant Vitor Pires Cabral carved his and six other names into a tree with his clip-point knife: LEAL, ALVAREZ, CLEMENTE, MARTINS, FONTANA, ESTEVES. He expected them all to die; he did not want them all to be forgotten.\n\nThe other six gathered around the campfire and discussed their next move. All were in broad agreement that they had two options: follow the Cuiari to the Amazon, and follow the waters to somewhere populated. Risky, for they may risk capture by the enemy, no doubt patrolling for the stragglers they routed on the battlefield. Leal proposed the other option: they head south, through the jungle, and hope they hit Brazil. Alvarez pointed to the map, pointed out they are only twenty klicks from the Içana river, within Brazil's borders. Clemente chewed them both out: don't they know how lost they are in the jungle? Martins tried to calm them all down, but cannot deny that he thinks entering a town is dangerous if they are allied with the new government. Fontana pointed out the obvious: whatever the outcome, if they stay here, they are dead.\n\nWhen Cabral returned to the group, Esteves was putting out the fire. He told him to rest up. They will march south at first light. He crawled into his bedroll and tried to go to sleep, but chirping insects, soft rains and the fear of an enemy patrol kept him from truly resting."

The Republic attempted to repair relations, but none of them seemed particularly serious: certainly not serious enough to be considered.\n\nBecause of this, we were surprised by a communique Bogotá sent to us earlier today.

However, the Colombian government was remarkably insistent on keeping a percentage of these companies in their hands, claiming that the enterprises would aid in the country's reconstruction.\n\nPresident [GetPresidentLastName] considered the matter. On one hand, this wasn't ideal: the fact that the Colombians were still so hesitant on returning what is rightfully America's. On the other, maybe it was a good sign that they were willing to consider handing over even a percentage at all.\n\nEventually, after much thought, [GetPresidentPronounLowercase] decided on how exactly they would respond, informing all relevant parties the following morning:"

We understand that this is their preferred option by some margin.\n\n\"Many in the State Department view this as an overextension. Their thinking is that America does not have the resources to intervene in every possible conflict. Rejecting any commitment to Colombia would leave us free of distractions, but would also anger their government.\n\n\"We could also offer a counterproposal. We would respect Colombian neutrality, but in exchange we demand the expulsion of all foreign agents.

After the succession of power from the War Council to the National Fascist Party, other members of New Granada's political sphere rallied against that decision, sending the new regime into the throes of a political crisis.\n\nNew Granada's other political factions, the militant Catholics, the Oligarchs, and the extremist militias, have all been jockeying for control and power, doing their best to topple the National Fascist Party, with the aims of taking control of the nation and its direction for themselves. It is unknown which faction, if any, will manage to bring down the National Fascist Party, but no matter who wins, Colombia's future will be altered permanently."

 WORLD.30139.desc: "The political turmoil that has engulfed New Granada has ended, and the colossus that is the National Fascist Party retains its political dominance over the new state. Defeating the Oligarchs, the Catholics, and the Pájaros for political control, the National Fascist Party has reestablished its position as the hegemon over Colombia.\n\nThe Catholic Church has been sidelined from politics, the corporate monopolies that once dominated Colombia have been busted, and the extremist militias have been routed. Now, the National Fascist Party's absolute power over New Granada will help stabilize the nation as the next party congress gets ready to convene and decide on a new course for the future."
 WORLD.30139.a: "The colossus's structure was not as compromised as it seemed."

 WORLD.30140.desc: "Further instability rocks Colombia. Following the victory of the New Granadan state in the Colombian Civil War, the 'Civillista' faction of the National Fascist Party has seized control during the latest party Congress. Ideologically composed of former conservatives who embraced fascism in its purest form as a new, fresher alternative to democracy, the Civillistas - led by the younger son of the late Laureano Gómez, Enrique Gómez Hurtado - intend to work for an efficient solution to the chaos engulfing Colombia."

 WORLD.30141.desc: "Fascism in New Granada has taken a much less dogmatic turn. Following the National Fascist Party Congress, the 'Patrician' faction has seized control of the party. As opposed to the more traditionally fascistic elements of the party, the Patricians - lead by Carlos Echeverri Cortés - are much more pragmatic, being composed of landlords and various regional leaders seeking to use fascism to increase their own personal control over the land."

 WORLD.30142.desc: "Developments out of Colombia continue to surprise, as it appears that the National Catholic Union has toppled the New Granadan government. Earlier today, the party's leaders proclaimed the party's intentions to form its own government to replace the now-deposed National Fascist Party.\n\nAs the representative party of the Catholic Church in New Granada, the UNC's recent triumph over its political rivals is being seen as the ultimate conquest of the political apparatus by the church. Led by Archbishop Mendoza Guerrero, the party's plans for the nation are directly entangled with the revival of its religious dogmas."

 WORLD.30143.desc: "In New Granada, an organization known as the Supreme Economic Council, known for being the main association of rural and industrial oligarchs in the country, has made a surprising putsch. This coup d'etat has expelled the fascist party and the church from the top echelons of power, giving the SEC full control over the state.\n\nAt the head of the SEC is Lisandro Sierra Velasquez, one of the former Antioquian business leaders, and credited as one of the few people in Colombia to kickstart the nation's industrialization. Sympathetic to the free market, privatizations are the order of the day. However, it is plain to see that these measures have the primary purpose of strengthening New Granada's latest pack of overlords."

 WORLD.30144.desc: "As the situation develops in the wake of the recent coup d'etat of New Granada by the UNC, it appears the new government has not secured its grip on power. The Pájaros, a notorious extremist militia, have announced that they have couped the young government and secured control of New Granada.\n\nWhile the government is formally led by León María Lozano, the situation is reality is far less organized, and the new regime has placed none other than the disgraced president Mariano Ospina Pérez in control of the regime's affairs. The ambitions of this new radical faction are, at best unclear, but one thing is certain to all observing:"

 WORLD.30114.desc: "In the wake of the ongoing Colombian Civil War, Gilberto Alzate Avendaño, also known as El Duce, has died in Cali after a long fight with cancer. Shortly following the announcement of Avendaño's death, the war council of New Granada has announced that it will assume emergency powers for the duration of the civil war.\n\nThe war council of New Granada also had other announcements to make, such as the release of an official testament of the late leader and the publishing of his memoirs within the upcoming days. A known reactionary, and one of the main political actors of the Colombian catastrophe, these publishing efforts will ensure that El Duce will be remembered for a long time."
