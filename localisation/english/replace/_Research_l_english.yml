 tech_signal_company2: "초기 전화 통신"
 tech_signal_company2_desc: "As communication technology advanced throughout the Great War, it allowed for further advancements in the capabilities of the many nascent signal units around the world. Improved radio communications and early motorcycles have begun to phase out the old messenger pigeons, but the most significant advancement has been the use of proper phone lines between signal units. This gives our boys vital security, keeping our most important secrets out of the hands of unsavoury people."
 tech_signal_company3: "정보 보증"
 tech_signal_company3_desc: "To better protect classified military secrets, signal troops have begun using advanced and cutting-edge cypher machines to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data sent between signal units. These ciphers are encrypted using codes that are often so advanced that the only way to crack them is to obtain the original code books, which our trust signal troops would never allow to fall into enemy hands."
 tech_signal_company4: "라디오 통신"
 tech_signal_company4_desc: "As radio and cypher technology advanced throughout the interwar period, it became widespread enough to be used as a standard means of inter-unit communications. Our troops no longer rely on antiquated messenger pigeons carrying handwritten communications that could be lost or fall into enemy hands. Instead, they use cutting-edge radio communications, which allows for much greater coordination between multiple units in a much shorter time frame."
 tech_signal_company5: "네트워크망 관리"
 tech_signal_company5_desc: "Now that our communication technology has enabled the near-instant coordination of multiple units, it has necessitated the introduction of communication hubs to manage the sheer volume of outgoing and incoming messages between signal units. These network hubs will greatly improve unit cohesion while also assisting in the compilation of the tidal wave of military intelligence delivered by our soldiers in the field."
 tech_signal_company6: "라디오 타워 건설"
 tech_signal_company6_desc: "While a portable radio and a signal officer or two may suffice for a small group of units communicating over a short distance, larger formations attempting to communicate over much greater distances will require something of higher calibre. The construction of radio towers near the headquarters of our various signal units will significantly increase efficiency and reduce burdens on an often overburdened communication network."

The power plant heats water to produce steam and it is this steam that powers the steam turbines and turbo generators. The power is then transferred to a gearbox that reduces the ratio by around 50 to 1 and this powers the propulsor. Naval nuclear propulsion is used specifically within naval warships such as supercarriers and submarines."

A new doctrine is emerging along the front, and it’s 10 feet deep."
 Mass_Charge: "대규모 돌격"
 Mass_Charge_desc: "While the war started at a breakneck pace, it has slowed to a crawl. In a bid to try and upend enemy positions, many commanders are using outdated mass infantry charges to cross the newly known No Man's Land. While the tactic has provided some limited success, we are bleeding casualties. Therefore, more men are required to bolster our divisions if we are to further this strategy."
 Static_Defence: "고정방어"
 Static_Defence_desc: "Trench Warfare has now become the default doctrine of this terrible conflict. Day by day, lines are wired, supplies are cached and tunnelers are digging. It is becoming clear that widespread offensives will give nothing but blood and inches. Staying below ground, below the storm of lead, is providing a defense unlike any conflict before. A war of attrition has begun."
 Counterattack: "반격"
 Counterattack_desc: "High Command has learned many lessons over the past months about offensive movements in defensive environments. Tunnelers are creating paths below the lead laden air, officers are finding breaks in the wires and artillery is creating literal walls of ordinance. Combining these tactics with immediate counterattacks is allowing our gains to be counted in miles rather than yards."
 Defence_In_Depth: "종심 방어"
 Defence_In_Depth_desc: "A deeper knowledge of fortification tactics is required to keep our armies in the conflict. Trenches are being designed snaking miles behind the battlefield. Pillboxes are deployed, artillery is emplaced and barbed wire is being unwrapped. The literal dirt beneath our feet is being gauged in its defensive properties. It’s no longer a static front, strategic depth is the path for total victory."
 Schwerpunkt: "Schwerpunkt"
 Schwerpunkt_desc: "In this bloody war of attrition, widespread offensives just lead to widespread casualties. All the largest battles drain the manpower of the involved nations. Instead, using a  focus point, or Schwepunkt, will bring tactical success. Every unit, company, officer and general are planning a single point of attack, even if risking other sectors. Concentrated spearheads will plow the enemy trenches."
 Separate_Arms_Force: "Separate Arms Force"

They have found their niche in this conflict, and while tactics are lacking, their individual contributions cannot be ignored."

While the ink is still wet on the treaties, some wonder if this is really an end or just a beginning."
