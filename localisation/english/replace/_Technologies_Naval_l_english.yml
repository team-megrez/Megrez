They were armed with four 102mm/60 caliber guns and nine 533mm torpedo tubes. They displaced over 1,200 tons and had decent speed for their size and vintage."

They were lightly armored and had twin 152mm/50 caliber Vickers guns as their main armament."

 RAJ_DD_equipment_1900: "V/W급"
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1900_desc: "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W-classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the Great War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of the Great War and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."

 RAJ_DD_equipment_1912_desc: "The G, H, and I-class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F-class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H-classes were the same as in the F-class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1916: "J/K/N급"
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1916_desc: "The J, K, and N-classes were similar to the earlier Tribal-class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1922: "배틀급"
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1922_desc: "The Battle-class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1900: "C급"
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1900_desc: "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the Great War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load. They saw extensive use during the Great War and participated in many surface actions. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."

These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."

 RAJ_CL_equipment_1922_desc: "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town-class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1933: "미너토어급"
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1933_desc: "Also known as the Swiftsure-class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony-class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony-class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "

As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings.

Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement.
