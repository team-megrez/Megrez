 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 
 POLITICS_VLADA_ZECEVIC_DESC: "Vladimir Zečević, better known as Father Vlada, is a man who has been many things. After joining the clergy, he served as a parish priest in a small town among the hills and woodlands of western Serbia, living a simple and pious life. It was only when the winds of war swept over the Balkans that Zečević left his church and flock to join the Chetnik resistance against the Germans. Despite rapidly rising through the ranks of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland, he quickly grew outraged with Mihailović's policy of collaborating with the Nazi invader against Tito's communists, defecting to the partisans with five hundred of his men in 1942.\n\nHis newfound communist loyalty not at odds with his faith, Vlada simply pinned a red star under the cross on his cap, and continued to fight. Despite increasingly desperate odds, the partisans resisted in face of the invaders long after the end of the war, striking at the Nazis and their collaborators before disappearing again into the forests and mountains of the Serbian heartland. And throughout all those years, Vlada was always there, in the midst of the action, inspiring his comrades with his sermons and his deeds.\n\nAs tensions rose between Rome and Germania, the Serbian-Croatian border became heavily militarized on both sides, de facto cutting off Serbia's partisans from Tito's headquarters. Rapidly, ASNOS descended into political squabbling, and soon enough Vlada ended up in command of the armed wing of the liberation movement, as he was largely detached from such political struggles. Now, after so many years, the NOV has decided to launch its final, all out assault - but it is yet to be seen if Serbia will finally be liberated, and if Father Vlada will be allowed to return to his parish for one last time, resuming the simple life of a pious priest he was forced to abandon so long ago."

 POLITICS_ALEKSANDAR_RANKOVIC_DESC: "Sometimes known by his nom de guerre, Leka, Aleksandar Ranković is the foremost member of the partisan old guard in Serbia, and for many, one of the few remaining symbols of the Yugoslav dream. Born into a poor family in the outskirts of Belgrade, Ranković joined the Serbian workers' movement at the age of 15, soon entering the Serbian Communist Party. A dedicated and indefatigable organizer, Ranković was arrested and imprisoned for six years by the authorities of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and upon being released immediately resumed his political activity, playing a vital role in the early strengthening of the Party in Serbia.\n\nNot even the war was able to stop him - immediately joining the partisan movement as Serbia was invaded by Germany, he was again arrested in 1941, but this time by the Gestapo. Surviving torture at the hands of the Nazi criminals, he was rescued by a daring partisan raid. In retaliation, Gestapo agents executed his wife and his mother. Ever more determined to fight on, Ranković would later go on to become a major leader in the communist leadership, founding and directing OZNA, the partisans' secret police and intelligence bureau.\n\nIn his role as president of ASNOS, Ranković was entrusted with keeping the flame of Yugoslav communism alive. An entire generation of Serbians grew up barely remembering Tito and his comrades, but Ranković was there to remind them - to remind them that through the people's struggle, a new Yugoslavia would be reborn from its ashes. As the red star has once more risen in the skies of Belgrade, a new light shines in the Balkans - destined to either lead the Serbs to the liberation of all Yugoslav peoples, or to be once more stamped out by the vile servants of fascism."

 #POLITICS_BORISAV_JOVIC_DESC: "In many ways, the life and rise to power of Borisav Jović is a mystery even to his supporters. Born in a small village in central Serbia to unknown parents, the details of his early life are barely known - however, young Jović studied economics in the University of Belgrade before joining the partisan movement. Distinguishing himself as a silent yet talented and ambitious organizer, Jović quietly and swiftly climbed the ranks of the liberation movement, managing the unofficial contact channels between the Serbian partisans and Italian agents in the Balkans, exchanging intel, and, according to some rumours, obtaining covert support from Rome.\n\nOrganizing the economic structure of ASNOS, Jović had already established a solid network of friends and supporters in the movement when he made his first public power plays. His outspoken Serbian patriotism and criticism of the partisan leadership quickly gained him sympathies among younger partisans, increasingly disaffected with their elders' Titoist and pan-Yugoslav rhetoric. After staying in the sidelines during the uprising that finally liberated Serbia, Jović only needed to give an order - without needing to lift a finger, he had almost the entire leadership of ASNOS arrested by his loyalists.\n\nRallying his supporters under the newly formed Socialist Party of Serbia, Jović won the first elections of free Serbia with barely any competition to oppose his widespread popularity. Using vaguely leftist and heavily nationalistic rhetoric, Jović paints the image of a reborn Serbia, one once again ready to become the lynchpin of the Balkans. While his detractors call him a populist quasi-dictator, his many supporters proudly rally around the red-blue-white flag that now waves free over Serbia - but many wonder if Jović's new Serbia is destined to be truly free."

 POLITICS_NIKOLA_KAVAJA_DESC: "Patriot, criminal, freedom fighter, bandit, rebel, terrorist. Nikola Kavaja is a man whose name is whispered with terror in all of Serbia, by his allies, his enemies, and his victims. Born in 1932, Kavaja witnessed as a child the deportation of his family by the invading Nazis - and then he killed for the first time, pushing a wounded German soldier into a well. As he grew up, his hatred for the occupiers grew with him, as did his fierce nationalism - and soon enough, Kavaja gathered around himself a disparate group of Chetnik remnants, disgraced collaborators, and common criminals, founding the Serbian Homeland Liberation Movement, or SOPO.\n\nAssassinations, kidnappings, sabotages, hijackings, bank robberies and bombings - with every action, SOPO grew more feared. Modeled after the Black Hand, SOPO compensated its relatively small numbers by mastering the arts of terror and brutality, striking Nazis when and where they least expected it. Even the partisans soon learned to fear Kavaja and his ferociously anti-communist gang - and yet, even when the two groups agreed to a truce before the offensive against the German garrison, nobody could expect what would come next.\n\nAfter quickly and brutally seizing power in Belgrade, Kavaja and SOPO took control of the whole of Serbia, violently crushing any form of resistance. Proclaiming the restoration of the Serbian kingdom, Kavaja and his men are now de facto in control of a new Serbia, their virulently nationalist propaganda being welcomed by the long downtrodden Serbs. And yet, the struggle for Serbian liberation is not yet over - and Kavaja is ready to ensure that no communist nor German invader dares ever again to try and usurp the throne of Nemanja, whatever the costs."

 POLITICS_DIMITRIJE_LJOTIC_DESC: "Of all the Serbs, only Dimitrije Ljotić and his clerical-fascist party ZBOR - the Yugoslav National Movement - are trusted enough to run the Serbian puppet régime. This makes sense given that he and his party were the only willing bootlickers of Germany in a country that was awash with anti-German sentiment even before the Second World War and the fall of Yugoslavia to the national socialist empire.\n\nBorn in 1891, he fought in the Serbian army during the First World War; afterwards, he entered politics. In 1931, he was appointed justice minister for all of six months, being forced out after proposing a political system that was too autocratic for even the notoriously authoritarian Alexander I. Afterwards, he founded the pro-German ZBOR only to be met with rejection in 1935 and 1938, forced into a lunatic asylum under not entirely false allegations of 'religious mania', and at last driven into hiding until 1941, when the Axis conquered the Balkans.\n\nWhen the Axis looked for collaborators, only Ljotić met the bill; very few were as enthusiastic, insane or sycophantic enough. A staunch anti-Semite, he proudly advocated the extermination of Jews before even many Nazis did. This combined with his crazed love of Germany, as well as an insane hatred of freemasons, communists, and capitalists, made him the perfect fit for control over the rump portion of Serbia left to native rule... too bad for him, then, that it does not work, and never could have.\n\nThe Serbian regime ruled by ZBOR is universally hated; not even the Church - who liked him for freeing their Patriarch from Dachau - tolerates him anymore. The country is a failed state that makes most basket cases look like Thomas More's Utopia. There is a refugee crisis, caused by Serbs that fled or were expelled by the Ustaše during their rule over Croatia. Various partisan groups - communists and nationalists alike - litter the countryside. Defections occur en masse every day.\n\nYet Ljotić, far from coming up with a solution, keeps ranting on and on just like his German idol. Why self-reflect, after all, when he can just blame the Jews, the liberals, the masons, the communists, and at times even the Pope, the Turks, or the Tsar of Bulgaria for his problems? The only solution to the Ljotić régime is putting it out of its misery. But at this point, it is not a matter of if that will happen but when."
 
 POLITICS_SEPP_JANKO_DESC: "Born in Ernsthausen in 1905, Josef "Sepp" Janko has been in Serbia all his life, and yet he has never lost his connection to his German Fatherland. The son of a Roman Catholic Banat German family, Janko studied law in Graz, and became a dedicated disciple of Pan-German nationalism and racialism. In 1939, he was elected President of the Swabian-German Cultural Association in Yugoslavia, and actively began to promote national socialism within Yugoslavia. When the Wehrmacht crushed Yugoslavia into dust in 1941, he was given command of the Deutsche Volksgruppe in Serbien und Banat, and was promoted to SS-Obersturmführer in Banat simultaneously. Janko set about to complete the Nazification and Germanization in his beloved Banat with a fiery dedication. To his dismay, however, many Danube Swabians in Banat were uninterested in fighting for the pride of Deutschland. In response, Janko, along with Heinrich Himmler himself, conscripted 3,000 Danubian Swabians into the newly-formed 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen.\n\nAfter the war was over in favor of Germany, Janko's fortunes began to wane. He was forced to abandon his SS ties after Himmler went rogue, and despite Janko's services to the Fatherland during the war, his role in the Serbian government was gradually phased out in favor of Serbian collaborators and the Wehrmacht. Janko, while still a major influence in Banat, was left bitter about his lack of direct control of the direction of Serbia. He became even more disheartened when reports of partisans in Serbia past the Danube became ever more common, and was devastated to learn that the entire south had fallen to partisans. When Janko thought it couldn't get worse, his beloved Fatherland collapsed, and the untermenschen of the south revolted against the German order. However, both Germany and the German order in Serbia held strong, and each learned to rebuild themselves quickly.\n\nNow that Germany has recovered, Janko has been chosen to lead the new Reichsprotektorat Prinz-Eugen-Land from his throne in Prinz-Eugen-Stadt. Janko's new task was simple: to cleanse the land of subhuman scum, and make way for permanent German annexation, to make Serbia a shining beacon of German superiority in a region awash with degenerates. It is a task that Janko has been awaiting for a long time, and he could not be prouder to lead the way to German dominance of the Balkans and the expansion of German power. With the forces of the German garrison and the RHSA at his beck and call, Janko stands ready to purify a land long contaminated, and bring about a national socialist rebirth to the rogue Serbian state."

 POLITICS_KARL_GOBEL_DESC: "Amidst the long brutalities of the Great War, Germany called upon its men to sacrifice themselves in defence of the Fatherland and the Kaiser. And so in 1918, mere months after having reached the age of maturity, Karl Göbel would heed the Fatherland's call and leave his homeland of Bavaria to serve as a soldier on the frontlines. Unfortunately for both him and his Fatherland, the German surrender would arrive in that very same year and national humiliation would ensue.\n\nAfter the war, Göbel remained dedicated to the defence of his country. He volunteered and was admitted into the Reichswehr which he would continue to serve in until his promotion to the rank of Oberleutnant in 1935 which was followed shortly by the replacement of the Reichswehr by the Wehrmacht. Soon after, his fatherland would call on him again to serve in the invasion of Yugoslavia and then once more to serve in the long and gruelling Russian Campaign where he would lead his unit to thunderous victory in the now infamous capture of Rostov, netting him the prestigious Knight's Cross.\n\nThe end of the Second World War saw Göbel appointed to post of Military Commander in Serbia where has served since. Perhaps an anomaly among his fellow peers, Göbel holds no particular disdain for Serbs or Slavs alike. However, as the protectorate descends further and further into chaos and anarchy, he has taken it upon himself to once more heed the Fatherland's call and crush the rogue partisans - in reality, they were nothing more than traitors and saboteurs - that dream of tearing apart his country."

 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_MUSICKI_DESC: "After the utterly despicable Ljotić, few collaborators are more notorious than Konstantin "Kosta" Mušicki - which makes sense, given among other things that Mušicki was the most prominent ethnic Serb fool enough to try to join the Ustaše despite, well, the Ustaše's well-known leanings.\n\nBut that was not Mušicki's only folly. Having joined ZBOR in 1934, after the assassination of the King, he was stationed in Slavonski Brod when the Axis invaded in 1941. Appointed as a colonel responsible for the Belgrade-Zagreb railroad, he supported not his country but the Germans during the invasion.\n\nAfter the war, Mušicki went to Belgrade, joined the Serbian Volunteer Corps - the German hatchetmen in Serbia - and was made its commander. During his time in that position he of course participated in any amount of brutal reprisals and massacres against civilians, supporting his patrons' aims. Due to that his forces were regarded as the only Serbian forces completely trusted by the Germans during the war.\n\nNow Ljotić is gone, and "Kosta" takes over. But Serbia of the ZBOR remains a failed state, still based upon cruelty, self-hating sycophancy, and corruption. It is still ruled by shameless fools and brutes led by a shameless fool and brute.\n\nThe reality remains the same; only the cosmetics have changed."

 POLITICS_NIKOLA_KALABIC_DESC: "For years and years the leader of the Ravna Gora Movement - colloquially the Chetniks - has waited for an opportunity to drive the Germans and their puppet ZBOR out of his tormented homeland. Now that that has happened, Nikola Kalabić feels his head spin at the shock of seeing something that he feared he would never get to see in his lifetime.\n\nA mere land-registry manager in Valjevo before the War, Kalabić entered service under Draža Mihailović's elite Mountain Guards. When Yugoslavia fell, Kalabić kept fighting, collaborating with both the Axis and the Allies. He was motivated by his abhorrence of leftism to enter agreements with Germany and Italy to fight the Partisans. Despite that, Allied commanders that dealt with him spoke highly of his unit and of Kalabić's authoritative personality and appearance.\n\nYet all that collapsed when Mihailović was suddenly captured and killed; the Chetniks suffered multiple critical defeats before they were able to reorganize under Kalabić's command - though it was all for the better in the end, since Kalabić is now in charge of what little remains of Serbia.\n\nBut the struggle of Nikola Kalabić is far from over. Two decades now he has fought both Germans and Partisans, wanting to free his fatherland against those he deems - rightly or not - to mean harm to it. But to his God, the God of Justice, who has saved the Serbs once more, Nikola Kalabić makes this vow: he will not fail or falter in his efforts until his eyes close forever."

 POLITICS_DOBRICA_COSIC_DESC: "In the aftermath of the Serbian Civil War, it is Dobrica Ćosić who has assumed responsibility for the welfare of the remnants of the Serbian state. Yet if you told a young Ćosić in 1938 or 1939 that this would be his fate he would laugh in your face or refer you to the local sanatorium.\n\nIn that time, the happy time before Yugoslavia was destroyed, Ćosić joined the Communist youth in Negotin. When the Axis came for Yugoslavia in 1941, he joined the Communist Partisans and took to his duties with alacrity... until the Soviet Union fell, and the war kept dragging on with no true hope of success.\n\nThen, he began to doubt the validity of both Communism and Yugoslavism. As a result, as he continued to rise through the ranks, he became more a nationalist than a communist. Exploiting the divide between the Italians and Germans - which was leading to the fortification of the Serbo-Croatian border, and dividing the Croatian and Montenegrin partisans from the Serbs and Macedonians - he inspired others that shared his sentiment and developed a sizeable following within the Partisan movement.\n\nAnd now that has reached fruition. The man that could debatably be referred to as the father of modern Serb nationalism now is in charge of his country, for better or for worse - though others may well have something to say about that."

 POLITICS_JOSIP_BROZ_TITO_DESC: "For decades, Josip Broz "Tito" has fought to defeat the fascists and their puppets within Yugoslavia. Even as the Soviet Union fell and the Westerners were prostrated, Tito did not fail or falter - instead he redoubled his efforts. And now, his efforts are rewarded; he and the Partisans have assumed responsibility for Serbia. For the first time in twenty years there is a modicum of hope in the Yugoslavian hell.\n\nBroz was born to a Croat father and Slovene mother in the village of Kumrovec. Drafted into military service, he became the youngest sergeant-major in the Austro-Hungarian Army of that time. Captured by the Russians during World War I, he was sent to a work camp in the Ural Mountains; when the Russian Revolution came, he joined in for a year. Upon his return to the Balkans in 1918, Broz entered Yugoslavia and joined the Communists. When the Nazis came, he led the Partisans against them throughout the old Kingdom.\n\nThings very nearly went to hell in Croatia in 1963 - Tito narrowly avoided a near-death experience, though he did not emerge uninjured. Fortunately, however, the ZBOR government in Serbia collapsed at that exact moment and his fellow partisans won out. He was taken to Serbia, ushered into the government, and made leader of the People's Republic.\n\nThis is a great opportunity, Tito knows. He will not squander it - no, he will restore hope to his tormented people. He will return freedom to Serbia, nay, to the entire Balkans."
 
 ### Ideas ###
 SER_Serbia_Shall_Not_be_Pacified: "Serbia Shall Not Be Pacified"
 SER_Serbia_Shall_Not_be_Pacified_desc: "The Serbian people have fought valiantly against the fascist occupiers and their lapdogs for decades. The Wehrmacht has continually struggled to maintain control over the mountainous and forested heartland of the nation. Instead, the Germans focused on fortifying key positions such as Belgrade, Banat, and the Bor mines. Beyond these few key areas, the vast majority of the countryside has been utterly discarded by the occupiers, effectively presented to the partisans on a silver platter."
 SER_government_of_anything_but_salvation: "Government of Anything But Salvation"
 SER_government_of_anything_but_salvation_desc: "Serbia, or officially the "Government of National Salvation," finds itself in a horrible, and unending decline. Created as a facade for German occupational control during the Second World War, it has been brutally suppressing dissent ever since. Rather than focus on actual nation building, the government instead fanatically pursues the destruction of "Judeo-Bolshevism" and "Freemasonry." Only gaining token concessions from the Germans, the government has done little to build up any legitimacy."
 SER_majka_srbija: "Majka Srbija"
 SER_majka_srbija_desc: "Ever since 1941, the people of Serbia have been degraded and spat upon by various powers. The Ustashe brutally persecuted all Serbs within Croatia's borders, forcing them to flee or die. Italy redrew the borders of Albania, and undertook Albanization programs in Kosovo. Despite oppressing its native Serb population, the Government of National Salvation tries to present itself as the caretaker and protector of all of its people, even if reality contradicts its propaganda."

While also opposed to the leftist NOV, SOPO have agreed to a truce with the partisans for the duration of the uprising - their terror tactics have proved very useful against the German troops, but their rising influence and power might prove dangerous down the line."
 SER_Generational_Divide: "Generational Divide"
 SER_Generational_Divide_desc: "Under the banners of the NOV, two generations fight together. One is the partisan old guard, loyal to Tito's pan-Yugoslav and communist vision for Serbia - the other is the younger wave of Serb recruits, who grew up during the war and barely remember a unified Yugoslavia. The younger partisans often don't share their elders' commitment to Tito or to Yugoslavia, instead espousing Serbian national sentiment and shunning communist doctrine - as their influence in the movement rapidly rises, it's hard to predict what the future of the partisan movement will be."
 SER_Refugee_Question: "The Refugee Question"
 SER_Refugee_Question_desc: "The numerous Serb refugees from neighboring regions in the Balkans are a vital source of manpower for the National Liberation Army - however, many of them wish to return to their homelands, and our country lacks the economic resources to provide adequate housing and jobs for them all. In the future, it will be necessary to either make arrangements for their repatriation, or integrate them into the Serbian economy."

 SER_Reactionary_Remnants: "Reactionary Remnants"
 SER_Reactionary_Remnants_desc: "Despite the establishment of our socialist republic, there are a few elements in our country that cling on to reactionary sentiments. These dangerous terrorists must be eradicated for the sake of our socialist Yugoslav fatherland!"
 SER_Yugoslav_Rebirth: "Yugoslav Rebirth"
 SER_Yugoslav_Rebirth_desc: "With our country liberated from the fascist occupier, we are ready to set ourselves on the path of reunification with Croatia and Bosnia, and perhaps even more territories of the former Yugoslavia, to create our new socialist federation. However, the problems posed by the clash between pan-Yugoslav ideals and local identities might prove difficult to solve, especially considering all the ethnic violence that took place in collaborator regimes during and after WWII."

 SER_Resurgent_Nationalism: "Resurgent Nationalism"
 SER_Resurgent_Nationalism_desc: "At last, Serbia is finally free. Free from the bootlicking collaborators, free from the Chetniks, and free from the marxists, who shall never corrupt our ranks again. Under Ćosić's rule, Serbia will finally be able to enter a period of national rebirth, as for the first time in decades, it is led by a person who truly believes in their nation, not just a bootlicker who will sell the country to the highest bidder."
 SER_SPS_Dominance: "SPS Dominance"
 SER_SPS_Dominance_desc: "The first elections in our young republic have resulted in an overwhelming victory of the Socialist Party of Serbia, most likely because there was basically no serious electoral opposition. As long as we are able to maintain the SPS's dominant status in Serbian politics, things will no doubt go smoothly."

 SER_Anti_German_Resistance: "Anti-German Resistance"

 SER_Reichsfestung_Belgrad: "Reichsfestung Belgrad"
 SER_Reichsfestung_Belgrad_desc: "Due to its key strategic importance as a stronghold on the river Danube and as a vital railway junction, the city has been since World War II one of the most fortified strongholds of the Wehrmacht. The German quarters of the city especially are a proper fortress, guarded by the best troops of the garrison against both the Slavic rabble that inhabit the suburbs and the partisan bandits in the countryside. The proud Germanic fortress of Belgrade must not and will not fall, whatever the costs!"
 SER_Serbian_Collaborators: "Our Useful Lapdogs"
 SER_Serbian_Collaborators_desc: "As much as any proper German despises working with Slavic untermenschen, it is sadly necessary for us to rely on Serbian collaborators to keep the country under control, as neither the Wehrmacht garrison nor the German population has the sufficient numbers to do the job. Organizations such as the Serbian Volunteer Corps and the 1st Belgrade Special Combat Detachment have proven to be reliable and loyal lapdogs, and what they lack in finesse they make up in brutality and devotion to National Socialist ideals."
 SER_Banat_Deutsche: "Banat Deutsche"
 SER_Banat_Deutsche_desc: "Initially organized into the Deutsche Volksgruppe in Serbien und Banat or DVSB, the ethnic German minority in Banat immediately became the main pillar of the German administration in Serbia. Their businesses providing the economic backbone of the country and their young men providing the main source of recruits for the garrison, the Banat Germans have since World War Two been organized into a proper gau of the NSDAP answering directly to Germania."
 
 SER_The_Crown_In_Exile: "The Crown in Exile"
 SER_The_Crown_In_Exile_desc: "To any outside observer, it would appear that every single Chetnik soldier is a die-hard monarchist, almost slavishly devoted to King Peter and willing to lay down their lives for him. On the ground though, this is rarely true, as two decades of exile have severed most ties between the King and his people. Most of the population concern themselves not with trivialities of the crown, but of more pressing matters such as their daily bread and other concerns."
 SER_Our_Island_Of_Freedom: "Our Island of Freedom"
 SER_Our_Island_Of_Freedom_desc: "Through the valiant efforts of our troops, we have established small liberated zones, areas free from the scourge of bolshevism and fascism. These small patches of freedom have come at a steep cost, however. To liberate even a small part of our country, we have expended the lives of thousands of our bravest soldiers, as well as the dignity of many commanders due to their collaboration. We just have to hope that these sacrifices will give us victory, for if we fail then Serbia will be in chains forevermore."
 SER_Return_Of_The_Kingdom: "Return of the Kingdom"
 SER_Return_Of_The_Kingdom_desc: "At its darkest hour, the nation of Serbia called upon its most loyal sons to take up arms and deliver it from the grasp of evil and so they, the blessed subjects of the most honourable king of the Serbs, rose up to answer its call for liberation from the chains of the occupying filth.\n\nThe spilt blood of cowardly traitors lines the streets and the trumpeting of victors can be heard echoing throughout Serbia, for the men of Ravna Gora have brought triumph. The mighty yet majestic nation of Serbia now stands among the ranks of the freed and the Chetniks that broke its chains now await to see the nation rise once again, under the watchful eye of its brave Suzerain: King Peter."
 SER_Thin_Facade_Of_Constitutionalism_I: "Thin Facade of Constitutionalism"
 SER_Thin_Facade_Of_Constitutionalism_I_desc: "In theory the Kingdom of Serbia is a constitutional monarchy and thus has a constitution. But one shouldn't take the existence of one as a sign that the kingdom is a liberal nation. On the contrary, the reality is that Serbia is ruled by a Chetniks military junta that harshly represses anyone who goes against its autocratic Serbian nationalist ideology.\n\nStudents, partisans, democratic activists have either been disappeared or outright killed. And while their relatives and friends might cry for them, the common citizen tries to live his life day by day and delude himself into believing things are normal."

 SER_The_Peoples_Liberation_War: "The People's Liberation War"
 SER_The_Peoples_Liberation_War_desc: "For more than two decades we have never ceased our war against fascist oppression. In the forests, hills, and mountains we have attacked, withdrawn and maneuvered, to ensure our survival until the perfect opportunity arrives. Now with the death of the cur Ljotić, it's time for our greatest offensive yet.\n\nThe People's Liberation War is coming to its end and we shall win it!"
 SER_A_Divided_Front: "A Divided Front"
 SER_A_Divided_Front_desc: "Under the banners of the NOV, two generations fight together.

 SER_Death_To_Fascism_Freedom_To_The_People: "Death to Fascism, Freedom to the People!"
 SER_Death_To_Fascism_Freedom_To_The_People_desc: "The nazi scum, the mongrel fascists, and the bastard collaborators have always sought to divide us. But even though the yoke of oppression weighs heavily upon them, the downtrodden masses of Yugoslavia have not been broken. With a raised fist and a loud voice, the men, women, and children who say this phrase demonstrate their united resistance to fascist tyranny."
 SER_Between_Revolutionaries_And_Royalists: "Between Revolutionaries and Royalists"
 SER_Between_Revolutionaries_And_Royalists_desc: "The Socialist Party of Serbia finds itself in a strange position.\n\nDobrica Čosič and his Left Nationalists currently act as the closest thing to a middle ground between monarchist Chetniks on the right, and Yugoslav Communists on the left. While Čosič's regime may currently act as a middle ground, fulfilling such a role and keeping both camps largely satisfied with SPS rule is another story."

 SER_Milos_against_Murad: "Miloš against Murad"
 SER_Milos_against_Murad_desc: "Reminiscent of Serbia's arduous struggle against the ever-expanding Ottoman Empire of the Middle Ages, Serbia is once more left alone in a sea of those who wish to see it crushed and defenestrated. The hostile Italian behemoth with its tendrils of imperialism slithers around our isolated Balkan homeland, all in hopes of smothering the zealous fires of our grand revolution, usurping our motherland and bringing an end to our newly restored liberty."
 
 SER_Our_Great_Teachers_Legacy: "Our Great Teacher's Legacy"
 SER_Our_Great_Teachers_Legacy_desc: "Dimitrije Ljotić, the former leader of our great nation, was more than a simple politician, he was the mind and the soul behind the ZBOR movement. He was there during the times of King Alexander's dictatorship, when all political movements were banned from the country, including ours. He was there when Serbia was liberated by the Germans, and rose up as a new guide for our people. And while today he is no more, Ljotić will live in the hearts of every patriotic Serbian, and it will be our duty to keep our great teacher's memory alive as we bring peace and order to Serbia."
 SER_The_Fatherland_In_Disarray: "The Fatherland in Disarray"
 SER_The_Fatherland_In_Disarray_desc: "For 30 years, Serbia has seen the worst the world has to offer. First, it was the Germans, marching through Serbia and plundering everything in their wake; then, it was the Volunteer Corps, propped up by their benefactors, allowed to squeeze the populace with a brutal and vice-like grip. The land has been laid to waste, and with it, its people. After all this time, the depths of destruction and despair are familiar to the average Serb.\n\nMothers weep, watching as their children waste away and struggle before their eyes. Fathers must be absent- cleaning up the little left, or enlisted with the broken government organizations available for them to support their families by. The next generation of Serbs, those born in this land of scorched fields and rubble, will have plenty of work ahead of them."
 SER_All_For_One: "One for All, All for One!"
 SER_All_For_One_desc: "With the conclusion of the Serbian civil war, we, the ZBOR movement, have defeated the opposition and rose to power. Under brigadier general Kosta Mušicki's guidance, the movement has solidified its place in Serbia for the coming years. We are more united than ever before, and soon we shall deliver unity everlasting to the Balkans. One for all, and all for one!"
