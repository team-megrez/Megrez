TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Chep_Success: "The winds of progress sweep across the United States. From New York to San Francisco, from San Antonio to Juneau, America's cities stand full of life and vitality. Their people bustle along well-paved roads and go to work at shining factories and offices. They enjoy leisure and travel great distances, ready to see where the road takes them. In these ways, Philip Hart and Chep Morrison leave America a transformed nation, better for their leadership.\n\nOf course, not every challenge has been defeated. War remains. Bigotry remains. Pain and human suffering still dot the globe. None of these monsters can be defeated, not permanently, but the torch of liberty seems to burn brighter than ever against the dark horizon. America stands ready for the challenges ahead. "
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Chep_Failure: "The air across America is stale and smoke-clogged. From New York to San Francisco, from San Antonio to Juneau, America's cities stand in a state of decay. Public schools in the South sit under-staffed. Rust creeps into disused factories along the Great Lakes. The white and wealthy retreat to suburban enclaves while poorer minority communities are left behind, forced to contend with fewer resources and political disinterest in their condition. In these ways Philip Hart and Chep Morrison's grand ambitions have failed. Stagnation has taken hold.\n\nOf course, there will be more challenges to come. War remains. Bigotry remains. Pain and suffering still dot the globe. None of these monsters can be defeated permanently and, amid the chaos, the torch of liberty seems dim against the dark horizon. Whether America can address the challenges ahead will need to be a question for another administration."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Schlafly: "Who are we? What are we doing? What have we done to each other? As tensions rise and arguments spill out onto the streets, many Americans are consumed by these questions. They no longer recognize their neighbors. They no longer recognize their country. They no longer recognize themselves. All is bile, anger, and frustration. Phyllis Schlafly, for better or worse, has exposed the rot at the center of the American system.\n\nOf course, this state of affairs raises questions for the decade to come. War looms on the horizon. Bigotry thrives. Pain and suffering dot the globe. None of these monsters can be defeated permanently and, in America at least, the fires grow and the threats seem stronger than ever. Whether this house divided against itself can stand or whether it will collapse onto its foundations is yet another question that will have to go unanswered until this radical new Administration finishes its term."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Yock_and_Hall_Torture: "This country is broken. It is obvious in the haunted faces of every person in the street, in every dilapidated storefront and burnt-out church. People have lost faith in their neighbors, their communities, and their government. They have lost faith in America and the ideals upon which the Republic was founded. Soon, perhaps sooner than many expect, there will be a great reckoning. Each citizen will need to confront their sins.\n\nOf course, America's collapsing institutions will not stop the crises to come. Indeed, it's likely to worsen it. Wars will spread. Bigotry will endure. Pain and suffering will be meted out upon the innocent and guilty alike. With the torch of liberty extinguished, monsters of all kinds creep their way toward the world stage. What happens next, and what violent delights they inflict, remains a mystery—for now."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Generic: "All of America holds its breath. After the chaos and uncertainty of the 1960s, the country seems to be entering a new age with a new set of developments. New technologies, capable of tremendous good and evil, appear. A new slate of leaders begins to accept their commands. A new generation enters the voting booths for the first time.\n\nOf course, there will be more challenges to come. War remains. Bigotry remains. Pain and suffering still dot the globe. None of these monsters can be defeated permanently but so long as the torch of liberty can burn against the dark horizon, America might endure."

TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Morita_Success_Ending: "Guangdong glitters in the glow of neon lights and cathode rays, the hallmarks of a life increasingly defined by Sony and Cheung Kong. Morita Akio, Li Ka-shing, and Stanley Ho have done what many believed impossible - redefining the corporate experiment in their own image, casting themselves as the plutocratic stewards of a Zhujin society taking root in the Silicon Delta.\n\nBut even as Morita and Li look back at the nation they have built, the future approaches relentlessly. Two suns, one white and one red, rise high in the Asian sky, burning away any shadows between them. The liminal space between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan grows smaller with every passing week; few dare ask what happens when said space disappears, for all fear that Guangdong will disappear along with it. \n\nIt is [GetYear], and the Two Zhujin of Guangdong face the challenge they have always had: survival, in the face of impossible odds."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Sony_Morita_Failure_Ending: "Even as Guangdong glitters, bathed in the neon lights of the nation built by Sony and Cheung Kong, Morita Akio is stalked by the spectre of ruin. Nearly two decades ago, he was banished from Japan, with Tokyo Telecommunications taken out from underneath him - and he has just barely survived a second brush with death at the hands of Ibuka Masaru.\n\nEven as Guangdong recovers from the Riots, the business of government is left increasingly in the hands of Li Ka-shing as the Chief Executive retreats to Sony headquarters. In Guangdong, where personal power is an extension of corporate power, the failed takeover of Sony is an existential threat that weighs far heavier on Morita than the growing enmity between Nanjing and Tokyo.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Morita's thoughts are consumed by a single, burning certainty: Ibuka may have started their feud, but Morita will be the one to end it."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Sony_Li_Failure_Ending: "Guangdong is awash in light and color, but all Li Ka-shing sees are darkness and shadows, harboring murderers in the twilight spaces untouched by Sony and Cheung Kong.\n\nA lifetime ago, he claimed he would work for the prosperity of all Chinese willing to better themselves. Privately, he would have admitted that he would do anything for a taste of the prosperity the Japanese enjoyed - a luxury he gained from his partnership with Morita Akio. But now, surrounded by the empty space where his wife should have been, he finds that his prosperity is bereft of pleasure or meaning. Neither can Li bring himself to renew his promise to the people - not after it has cost him so much. He is lost, even as the threat of renewed hostilities between China and Japan looms just over the horizon.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Li Ka-shing returns to work - in the forlorn hope that it can fill the gaping maw in his soul."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Matsushita_Success_Ending: "Matsushita Electric reigns supreme over Guangdong - and Matsushita Masaharu revels in knowing that all under heaven is his.\n\nWhere he once was one executive among many, sharing in the spoils of Guangdong's profits, now he towers over all of them, directing profit and prestige as he sees fit. His benevolence feeds his workers and rewards his allies; his wrath cares little for the suffering of malcontents and his enemies. With Matsushita Electric fusing with the state, the distinction between the personal, corporate, and common interest has faded into nothingness - a personal kingdom that, even as rumors of war sweep the streets, is Matsushita Masaharu's unvarnished triumph.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Matsushita Masaharu has proven to the world - and the man whose opinion matters most of all - that he is his own man."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Matsushita_Failure_Morita_Ending: "Matsushita Electric reigns supreme over Guangdong - but Matsushita Masaharu fades into the background, a captain absent from the helm of his ship. Perhaps that accurately reflects the state of affairs - that it is no longer Matsushita Masaharu's ship, but Morita Akio's.\n\nTo rule with the sole purpose to pursue personal power is a simple goal, one that is easily understood - and one that is easily manipulated. Where Matsushita fancied himself the master of Guangdong in a time of peace, he clung to the heels of more principled men in a time of chaos - and quickly found his 'benevolence' being channeled for the benefit of Sony and Cheung Kong. He sits, but the documents he reads are not in his handwriting; he stands, but the words he speaks are not his own.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and the naked pursuit of power remains a principle as strong as any other - Matsushita Masaharu was simply an unworthy man."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Matsushita_Failure_Ibuka_Ending: "Matsushita Electric reigns supreme over Guangdong - but Matsushita Masaharu fades into the background, a captain absent from the helm of his ship. Perhaps that accurately reflects the state of affairs - that it is no longer Matsushita Masaharu's ship, but Ibuka Masaru's.\n\nTo rule with the sole purpose to pursue personal power is a simple goal, one that is easily understood - and one that is easily manipulated. Where Matsushita fancied himself the master of Guangdong in a time of peace, he clung to the heels of more principled men in a time of chaos - surrendering himself to the hard decisions Ibuka Masaru was willing to take. And as Matsushita went, so too did the section chiefs of the government and the executives in the Legislative Council.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and the naked pursuit of power remains a principle as strong as any other - Matsushita Masaharu was simply an unworthy man."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Ibuka_Persistence_Ending: "Ten generations after the creation of Adam God saw the earth had been tainted beyond hope. So he called upon a flood that lasted forty nights and forty days, tearing down all that he had created and making it anew.\n\nOf course, Ibuka Masaru knows that the tale was made up - but what thing on earth wasn't, anyway? Compassion? Trust? Morals? Pan-Asianism? People constantly come up with the most asinine of reasons to validate what they do, be it throwing incendiary bombs into storefronts or going to war over arbitrary lines on the East Asian map. If made-up things and made-up stories are what humanity finds comfort in, it is only fair Ibuka indulges himself in the same. Fujitsu Limited, then, is his Ark; its pristine blue-white lights are his great flood, drowning out all the colors and voices from his head, forever.\n\nIt is [GetYear], 4321 years since the great Noachian Flood - and, God willing, another is soon to come."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Ibuka_Reconciliation_Ending: "Ibuka Masaru had been as much a man of God as he had been a man of his own "vision"; both of which, he now realizes, are products of his own fantasy. He wanted a success story, and made Guangdong its unwilling actor. He jabbed marionette strings into its arm and dangled it around for a farce - all to the content of his own heart, or whatever that was left of it.\n\nIt is thus that, after the Riots have proven his grip on state affairs untenable, Ibuka has elected to loosen it altogether. Supporters have expressed nothing but relief; skeptics, on the other hand, decry wasted potential, social upheaval, and political uncertainty. There is one thing of which the Chief Executive is certain, however: better to let other voices speak to him than suffocate them all. Because a story is made of more than one person; otherwise, it becomes delusion.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Guangdong's light will flicker and falter in the years to come. Maybe it is better that way."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Komai_Manchurian_Ending: "Komai Kenichiro may have borrowed the gun he used to seize control of Guangdong - and now, the loan has come due.\n\nEven as the petty tycoons of the Legislative Council squabbled amongst themselves, Komai Kenichiro has always served a larger power - and has always answered to their wishes. Mangyō and Nissan were never above underhanded tricks to eliminate the competition, making Komai their agent on the inside, to consume and subvert Guangdong's energy for Manchuria's benefit. With Komai safely in power, such an investment was obviously worth protecting from the chaos of the Riots - a convenient excuse to leash him ever closer to the powers that be in Hsinking. Whether through money, obligation, or outright intimidation, Komai will never forget who his true masters are.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Guangdong enters a terrifying future under its new masters - one in Kōshu, and the other in Hsinking."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_Hitachi_Personalist_Ending: "Komai Kenichiro may have borrowed the gun he used to seize control of Guangdong - but he has no intention of ever giving it back.\n\nThere is no room for petty squabbling or disunity - in either business or politics. The feckless executives of the Legislative Council were beyond saving, and Suzuki hadn't seen fit to finish the job, and so it fell to Hitachi to realize Guangdong's original design - to render a province and its people into replaceable cogs in a remorseless machine. There was violence, to be sure - but two can play at that game, and nobody questions Komai's methods now. Not LegCo, not Nissan, not Mangyō or Manchukuo or even Japan - Komai is sui generis, a corporate king anointed with the blood of thousands, while China grinds its teeth and sharpens its sword.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Guangdong enters a terrifying future under its new master - with life and liberty sacrificed to the will of a single man."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_IJA_Failstate_Normal_Ending: "As Guangdong was created by Japanese fiat, so too does it meet its end.\n\nWhere corporate limousines and coolies once ran through the streets, now tanks and soldiers stand watch at every major intersection. The blood in the gutters has barely dried, even as shots ring out intermittently from back alleys as the last of the rioters are executed for their crimes. The population wilts in the face of military control; the Chinese government rails at the heavy-handed Japanese intervention, even as Japan defends its actions as necessary in the face of revolution in the streets. If words fail, then the soldiers taking positions on the border will soon have their say.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Guangdong has entered history - not for the circumstances of its existence, but for the ignominious nature of its destruction."
TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_GNG_IJA_Failstate_Hitachi_Ending: "As Guangdong was created by Japanese fiat, so too does it meet its end - with embers of resistance threatening to spark a conflagration that engulfs Asia whole.\n\nWhere corporate limousines and coolies once ran through the streets, now tanks and soldiers fight partisans on every corner. The blood in the gutters continues to run fresh, as the Chinese who refused to countenance Hitachi's bloody reign fight, in turn, until the bitter end. With Komai Kenichiro dead, there is nobody left to take responsibility for the weeping wound that is Guangdong; the Japanese defend their intervention as a necessary evil (against what they do not say), even as the Chinese rush troops to the border with howls of indignation at the suffering of their brethren. The diplomats speak past each other, and soon the generals will have their say.\n\nIt is [GetYear], and Guangdong has entered history - not for the circumstances of its existence, but as a footnote to the terrible bloodletting yet to come."
