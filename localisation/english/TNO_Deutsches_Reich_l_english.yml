 POLITICS_REINHARD_GEHLEN_DESC:0 "Broken. Scorned. Abandoned. These people, these refugees, they've found their leader...but how far can they look into the light until they are blinded?\n\nReinhard Gehlen exists within service to many things, be they for the Reich, for the people of Germany, or even just for himself. Operating as an intelligence officer since the early days of the Weimar Republic, Gehlen is attributed in being the man who revolutionized the offices of Germany's intelligence agencies, many would argue that Reinhard Gehlen acted courageously for the sake of the dedicatedly conservative National Socialists of the Reich. However, those within the inside know that, even after the end of the Second World War, Gehlen continued to operate for the sake of himself, as he continued to coalesce the intelligence community under his control more and more, and attempting to rip it away from the claws of Heinrich Himmler.\n\nArbitrary rules, a slowing bureaucracy, and more only showcased Gehlen's continued rise within the Reich. As many as he has inspired within the community, many would harbor a feeling of exhaustion and frustration in regards to Gehlen's operations of the intelligence community. Nevertheless, his stand against Heinrich Himmler and the SS's grabs towards dominating the intelligence operations of the Reich has genesised a following for the Generalleutnant that gave many Speerites and Bormannites a figure to stand behind, especially as the power of the Schutzstaffel within the Reich began to rise, and the shadow of Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich began to overtake the shining light of the Reich for the people of Germany.\n\nNow, Germany stands shattered, with two madmen attempting to claim themselves as the true leaders of National Socialism above Germany slaughtering all who stand in their path to get there. Many who supported Albert Speer and Martin Bormann have fled to the city of Stuttgart, under the banner of the Generalleutnant. However, Gehlen fears the very image he worked so hard to build up, as the flames fervor and radicalism of the conservatives in the area continues to grow. Gehlen may stand fervently against either leader, but he knows that enemies stand at all sides, and his image alone will not save his people..."
